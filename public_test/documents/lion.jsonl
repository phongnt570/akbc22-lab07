{"animal": "lion", "title": "27 Fun Lion Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/lions/", "text": "Lion Profile\nThe Lion (Panthera leo) is the second largest cat in the world, following the Tiger. It is a species in the cat family \u2018Felidae\u2019, which includes Tigers, Leopards and Jaguars.\nThey inhabit the grasslands and savannahs in Sub-Saharan Africa, and there is a critically endangered population in a small section of India.\nLion Facts Overview\nHabitat: Savannas, Grasslands, Scrub, Open Woodlands Location: sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Central African Republic & South Sudan Lifespan: 10 \u2013 15 Years Size: 4.6 \u2013 8.2 ft (1.4 to 2.5 m) Weight: 265 \u2013 550 pounds (120 \u2013 250 kg) Color: Tawny Brown, & White (A Rare Morph) Diet: Zebras, Giraffes, Wild Pigs, Cape Buffalo, Antelope, Wildebeests Predators: Hyenas, Leopards (When Cubs) Top Speed: 80 Kph (50 Mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nVulnerable\nThe lion is visibly different from most other cats in that they have a muscular, deep chest with a short but rounded head. The neck is reduced and they have rounded ears plus a hairy tuft at the end of their tails. The male is easy to distinguish from the female, as they have a prominent mane.\nLions are diurnal, which means they typically hunt during the day, but they can adapt and hunt at night if necessary.\nThe lion has few predators, although man is reducing the habitat they require on a regular basis, which has put the lion on the vulnerable list of the IUCN. This means that their natural habitat is shrinking along with their numbers. They are slowly moving into the territory identified as endangered.\nInteresting Lion Facts\n1. African lions live in groups called \u2018prides\u2019.\nThe African lion is actually the most social of all big cats on the planet. A pride can include up to 30 animals, but typically are made up of 10-15, with five or six females, their cubs (both male and female) and two males who breed with the females in the group.\n2. Young male lions get kicked out of the pride by older males when they reach sexual maturity, at about 2 years old.\nThese young males then live and roam in small groups (often with brothers and cousins), until they find another pride that they could take over and breed with females. This will often lead to fights with existing males in the pride.\n3. When a male lion takes over a pride, it can kill all the lion cubs to bring the pride\u2019s females into heat again.\nThis allows the new males to breed and raise their own offspring.\n4. A male lions mane is a symbol of their fighting ability and health to both potential mates, and rivals.\nExperiments showed that darker and longer manes are attracted more females, and male lions were more likely to attack blonder, and shorter manes.\n5. Lionesses can turn on and kill older previously dominant males in a pride.\nMale lions become a member of the pride because the females accept them as the pride male. Therefore, their social status can can be precarious. The lion has to win the grace of the females and usually will only be able to remain the pride male 3 to 5 years in the wild.\n6. Lions have a roar that can carry up to 8km (5 miles).\nThe roar of a lion can be heard as far away as 5 miles from the source.\n7. Lions run up to speeds of 80 Kph (50 Mph).\nWhile not quite as rapid as the Cheetah which can reach speeds of 70mph, a lion can achieve a land speed of 50 Mph for short distances.\n8. They have an amazing jump, and have been recorded springing as far as 36 feet.\nThey can also climb extemely well, capable of climbing vertical trunks of trees with ease.\n9. There is also a very rare white lion.\nIt is not a different sub-species or albino, the white is due to a genetic condition called leucism, which causes a partial loss of pigmentation.\n10. Lions can live twice as long in captivity.\nIn the wild, the average life span for a lion is between 10 and 14 years. They can live up to 20 and 25 years in captivity.\n11. The lion diet is primarily meat.\nAfrican lions hunt and consume large animals they find in the grasslands they inhabit. These animals include zebras, wildebeest and antelopes. The male lion requires 7-kilograms of food daily and the female can survive on 5-kilos.\n12. Lionesses do much of the hunting.\nThe majority of the hunting in a group of lions is handled by the females. They will actually use intelligent hunting tactics and work as a group to trap and capture prey they would otherwise not be able to get while hunting on their own. They also use this \u2018team approach\u2019 to other activities within the pride.\n13. Lions are pretty good at chilling out.\nActually, the average lion will spend between 16 and 20 hours a day just resting or sleeping. It\u2019s because they do not have many sweat glands so in order to conserve energy, lions will just lie about and watch the world unfold around them. They are more active at night when it is cooler although they do conduct most of their hunting activity during the day.\n14. They have amazing vision.\nThe eyes of the lion are six times more sensitive to light than the eyes of a human. This means their night vision is far better than that of some of their prey.\n15. Lions mate early in their lives.\nThe age is the same for both male and female. Either is ready to mate when they reach the age of 3 to 4 years.\n16. There is a rather short gestation period for lions.\nIt takes about four months before a young lion is born.\n17. The birth process is kept secret.\nFor some reason, the pregnant lioness will give birth to a cub away from the rest of the pride. Then she will proceed to hide the young from everyone else for the following six weeks.\n18. Lion cubs are very small at birth.\nA newborn will weigh not much more than 3-pounds at birth and will be completely dependent on its mother for the first several months of its life.\n19. Lionesses are pretty awesome mothers.\nNot only are they caring towards their own young, if a cub is neglected in any way, a lioness will allow it to suckle in an effort to help the cub survive.\n20. Cubs are raised together in a pride.\nThe females in a group of lions typically give birth at about the same time. This allows for the cubs to play and grow up together with support from the entire pride.\n21. Maturing cubs have different roles.\nThe female cubs will stay with the pride as they grow older. At the age of two they will be hunters for the pride. At that same age, the males are pushed out of the pride.\n22. You can tell the age of male lions by the colour of their mane.\nThe mane of the male lion gets darker as it ages so the darker mane of a lion in a pride denotes the oldest of the group.\n23. Lions walk in an unusual manner.\nTheir heels do not touch the ground when a lion walks. This is because they have big toes and pads on the bottom of their feet, which allow them to move quietly.\n24. The lion population has dropped considerably in the past few decades.\nIn the 1950\u2019s there were an estimated 50,000 lions in Africa. Today there are around 21,000.\n25. Lions are symbolic in various cultures.\nThe lion generally stands for strength and courage and as such, are usually symbols commonly used in association with royalty. It is probably because of this that the phrase \u201cKing of the Jungle\u201d came into being.\n26. Lions have a very, very long history on the planet.\nAncient Egyptians held lions in high esteem as their war deities because of the power, strength and fierceness lions possess. The sphinxes in Egypt are a fine example of the age old depiction of lions in Egyptian culture. The lion head also appears in many pieces of art from ancient times as well in pieces of jewelry.\nLion Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Suborder: Feliformia Family: Felidae Subfamily: Pantherinae Genus:\nPanthera Species Name:\nPanthera Leo\nRelated \u2018Big Cat\u2019 Facts"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Lion images!\nThe lion is Africa\u2019s apex predator\nThe lion is one of the largest, strongest, and most powerful felines in the world, second only in size to the Siberian Tiger. They are the largest cats on the African continent. While most big cats are solitary hunters, lions are incredibly sociable animals that live together in family groups called pride. They are some of the world\u2019s most popular animals.\nIncredible Lion Facts!\nBetween 1993-2014, the IUCN estimated the population of lions decreased by 42%. Due to poaching and habitat loss, its estimated there may be fewer than 20,000 lions left today.\nWhile lions are generally social animals, prides generally consist of 80% females. For this reason, only about one in eight male lions survive to adulthood. Groups of male lions sometimes band together, controlling vast swaths of territory. One famous band of male lions in South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park controlled over 170,000 acres and was estimated to kill more than 100 rival lions and cubs.\nLions are animals that have long been kept in zoos and in captivity. In 18th century England, the price of admission to the Tower Menagerie (the pre-cursor to the London Zoo) was three pence, or a cat or dog to be fed to the lions!\nThe largest lion ever recorded weighed 690 pounds and was shot in South Africa in 1936. Ancient lions were even larger than today\u2019s largest lions, and reached up to 1,153 pounds!\nThe lion is considered one of the \u201cAfrican Big Five.\u201d\nFor our full list of incredible lion facts, see our 13 mind-blowing lion facts page.\nLion Scientific Name and Classification\nThe scientific name for lions is Panthera leo. The genus Panthera is of Greek origin and comprises big cat species such as tigers, lions, jaguars, and leopards that have the ability to roar. Leo is the Latin word for lion.\nThere are two types of lion subspecies. One is named Panthera leo melanochaita and lives across South and East Africa. The second lion subspecies has the scientific name Panther leo leo and lives in West Africa, Central Africa, and Asia. You may see references to African and Asiatic lions. Up until 2017, there were two recognized subspecies, the African and Asiatic lions, but scientists reclassified lions that year. For more information on the types of lions see our full lion classification guide.\nLion Anatomy and Appearance\nLions have a short coat of tawny or golden fur with a long tail that has a tuft of longer fur at the end. The markings on their coats are much fainter than the bold stripes and spots displayed on other felines which helps these large carnivores in going unseen when stalking prey in the long grasses. Lions have strong and powerful jaws that contain 30 teeth in total which includes four fang-like canines and four carnassial teeth that are perfectly designed for slicing through flesh.\nLion Mane\nThe lion is one of the largest cats in the world with males being taller and heavier than females and displaying a mane of long hair around their faces (in fact, it is the only case in the feline world where males and females actually look different). Thought to be connected with testosterone levels, the mane of the male lion ranges from blonde to red, brown, and black in color and covers their head, neck, and chest.\nWhite Lions\nSeveral big cat species have been observed in the wild with color mutations, such as the white tiger or black panther. Likewise, there is an uncommon color mutation of lions that leaves their coat extremely pale.\nUnlike white tigers which are albino \u2013 that is, lacking in color pigments in their coat \u2013 the coat of white lions is caused by recessive traits. The uncommon nature of white lions led to them being captured and moved into captivity in the second half of the 20th century.\nToday, white lions are bred across many zoos and wildlife parks. For example, in North America, six white lions are located at Parc Safari near Montreal, Quebec as of 2020. However, they\u2019re now being reintroduced back into environments in South Africa and are successfully breeding and hunting in their native environments.\nLion Distribution and Habitat\nHistorically, Lions would have been found throughout much of Africa and even in parts of Europe and Asia as well. Today, however, they have been pushed into more isolated pockets of their once vast natural range with the remaining African Lion population now only found in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. There is also still a small population of Asiatic Lions found inhabiting a remote part of the Gir Forest in India.\nDespite their dwindling numbers, Lions are actually incredibly adaptable animals that can and will inhabit very dry climates as they get most of the moisture they need from their food. They prefer areas of open woodland, scrub, and long grasslands where there is not only plenty over cover but also a wide variety of prey. They are only not found in areas of rainforest or far into deserts.\nLion Population \u2014 How Many White Lions Are Left?\nLike other big cat species, the lion is under threat from habitat loss and hunting. Between 1993 and 2014, the population of lions decreased by 42%. The IUCN\u2019s last assessment places the adult population between 23,000 to 39,000 mature individuals. Today, lions as a species are listed as \u201cVulnerable,\u201d a step above being declared \u201cEndangered.\u201d\nWhile the Africa lion\u2019s population likely numbers over 20,000, Asiatic lion populations are estimated to number just 600 individuals. Asiatic lions are limited to just a single wildlife sanctuary in India that measures just 545 square miles (1,400 sq. km). Further growth in the population of Asiatic lions will rely on reintroduction into new habitats in India.\nExtinct lion species and subpopulations\nScientists believe that 10,000 years ago lions were the most widespread mammal outside of humans. However, today their range is a fraction of its historical size. This comes from the extinction of two unique lion species near the end of the last ice age and habitat loss that has reduced the range of lions\nBarbary lion\nThe Barbary lion used to live across the North Coast of Africa, with a range that stretched from Egypt to Morocco. Until recently, it was believed to be a distinct subspecies of lion, but research now shows it\u2019s genetically similar to Asiatic lions.\nThe Barbary lion was largely hunted to extinction in the 19th century. The last documented sighting was in Algeria\u2019s Atlas Mountains in 1942 (although, skins were found on illegal markets into the 1980s, suggesting the Barbary lions may have survived longer), leaving the lion regionally extinct in North Africa. Today, Barbary lions aren\u2019t recognized as unique subspecies, but for much of the 20th century, they were believed to be.\nCape lion\nThe Cape lion used to live in South Africa and was defined by a darker mane than many other lion populations. Today, the Cape Lion is recognized as a subpopulation rather than a different species or subspecies. There have been no lions found in the Cape lion\u2019s range since 1858.\nCave lion (Panthera leo spelaea)\nThe Cave lion was a species of lion that stretched across Eurasia and into Alaska and went extinct with the collapse of the mammoth steppe about 12,000 years ago. The species lived across all of continental Europe and many archeological drawings of lions from that area depict cave lions. The species was larger than today\u2019s surviving lions. In recent years, a number of frozen cave lion cubs have been discovered in Russia\u2019s permafrost.\nAmerican lion (Panthera leo atrox)\nAnother lion species that disappeared roughly 12,000 years ago during a period of global climate change, the America lion\u2019s ranged stretched across most of the modern-day United States and Mexico. The American lion is notable for being the largest lion species. Its habitat was similar to today\u2019s African lion, with it hunting across large grasslands on large mammals like bison, deer, and even mammoths.\nLion Behaviour and Lifestyle\nLions are unique among cats as they live together in strong social groups. A pride is made up of 5-15 related females and their cubs along with a generally single male (small groups of 2 or 3 though are not uncommon). Male Lions patrol a territory of around 100m\u00b2 marking trees and rocks with urine and roaring to warn off intruders. Although male Lions can defend their pride to great effect, their position in the pride is constantly under threat from other males who try to take over their patch and if successful, they will kill any cubs that were sired by the previous male. Despite their enormous size, male Lions actually do hardly any of the hunting as they are often slower and more easily seen than their female counterparts. The Lionesses in the pride hunt together meaning that they are not only more successful on their trips, but they are also able to catch and kill animals that are both faster than them and much bigger.\nLion Roar\nLion roars can be extremely loud, reaching about 114 decibels in volume. Their roar is loud enough to breach the pain threshold of human hearing! Lion roars are louder than any big cat, and can be heard from a distance of about 5 miles away (8 km). The ability to roar at such a high volume is due to unique adaptations in the lion\u2019s vocal folds. Lions generally roar as a warning and to defend their territories. Beyond warning off males, lion roars also allow members of the pride to find one another as its sound can travel such long distances.\nLion Reproduction, Cubs, and Lifespan\nBoth male and female lions are able to reproduce between the ages of two and three but despite this, they will often not breed until the pride has been firmly established. After a gestation period that lasts for nearly four months, female lions give birth to between one and six cubs that are born blind and are incredibly vulnerable in their new surroundings. The fur of lion cubs is covered in darker spots that help to camouflage them into their den to protect them whilst the adults have gone out to hunt.\nSadly, however, less than half of cubs make it to be a year old and four out of five have died by the time they are two, generally either from animal attacks or starvation. Remarkably though, the female lions in the pride will have their cubs at around the same time and will help to suckle and care for the cubs of other females. Lion cubs suckle on milk until they are about six months old and although they won\u2019t begin actively hunting until they are about a year old, lion cubs start to eat meat after 12 weeks or so.\nLike most big cats, lions live about 10 to 15 years. In captivity, lions have lived quite a bit longer than in the wild. In 2016, the Philadelphia Zoo was had to euthanize a 25-year old female lion after it began suffering from limited mobility.\nLion Diet and Prey\nThe Lion is a large and carnivorous animal that survives only by eating other animals in order to sustain itself. Lions eat a diet that consists of buffalo, wildebeests, and even giraffes. Depending on the abundance and variety of prey species within their territory, Lions primarily catch gazelle, zebra, and warthog along with a number of antelope species by following the herds across the open grasslands. They will not turn their noses up though at hunting alone should the situation arise and will happily steal the kill of another animal. Once the animal has been caught though, circumstances change as the females will allow the male Lion to eat first before indulging themselves. The cubs however are at the bottom of the pile and have to be content with what remains once the adults have finished.\nUnlike other felines, lions are not solitary hunters but instead, the lionesses work together in order to chase down and catch their prey with each female having a different strategic role. This strategy allows them to kill animals that are both faster and much larger than they are. A study of 1,300 lion hunts found that when hunting individually, their success rate on hunts was 17-19%. However, when hunting in groups, success rates jumped to 30%.\nOn average, lions eat about 17 to 20 lbs (8 to 9 kg) of meat per day. Males can about 100 pounds in a day (43 kg), while females can eat 55 pounds (25 kg).\nFor a complete analysis of the diet of lions, make sure to read \u2018What Do Lions Eat? 15 Foods They Hunt.\u2018\nLion Predators and Threats\nThe lion is the most dominant predator within its environment meaning that other animals pose little or no threat to them, with the exception of hyena packs that can cause fatal damages to lions particularly when they are on their own and food is about. Lions are seen as a great threat by many other species including both giraffes and elephants which are easily capable of fatally injuring a lion to try and warn it off.\nMore than other species, the significant threat to lions is other lions. In South Africa\u2019s Sabi Sands a group of male lions formed a coalition that\u2019s believed to have killed more than 100 lions across a territory that eventually ranged across 170,000 acres. Male lions will often kill one another while attempting to seize control of prides, and then will also kill cubs of prides to ensure a gene pool that\u2019s not theirs is passed on.\nLion numbers have also been severely affected by diseases passed through hyenas from wild dogs, with more than 1,000 lions having died from canine distemper between 1993 and 1997.\nLion Relationship with Humans\nHowever, the biggest threat to Lions is people who not only kill them out of fear (and historically as trophies) and the encroachment of agriculture and cities. Lions have been admired and feared by people for centuries, but due to both hunting and growing human settlements, lions have been wiped out from a vast portion of their historical natural range.\nAlthough they do not naturally see people as prey, African Lions have been known to sneak into villages (sometimes of great size) to find food, and are known to attack up to 700 people every year, with Lions being responsible for 100 human fatalities annually in Tanzania alone. In 1898, two Lions in Kenya (known as Tsavo lions \u2013 a pair of mane-less Lion) became famous for killing and eating over 130 rail-road workers over a period of around 9 months.\n3 more lion facts\nRemember to read our full lion facts page to get a full list of the most incredible facts on this remarkable species. You\u2019ll find facts like:\nYoung lions practice role playing!\nYoung Lion cubs spend a great deal of time playing together which actually helps them to develop their hunting techniques. This method of role-playing in cubs also helps females to determine whether or not they would be suited better to chasing and cornering prey, or catching and killing it.\nLions have small hearts and lungs and must rely on stealth and teamwork\nThe Lion has large paws with soft pads underneath and sharp retractable claws on the end of each toe which aid them in running, climbing and catching their prey along with also being good defense mechanisms. The structure of their feet and legs means that they are also able to jump distances over 10 meters. Lion hearts weigh about 1,175 grams, which in relation to their body size is significantly smaller than many of the herbivores they hunt. Their heart and lung size means lions can only exert themselves for small distances and must rely on teamwork and sneaking up close to prey before beginning their hunt.\nThe world\u2019s most famous lion survived a plane crash\nOne of the most famous depictions of a lion is the roaring lion at the start of film\u2019s from MGM studios. To raise publicity for this lion, in 1927 MGM flew their mascot across the country, but in a flight from San Diego to New York the plane crashed. The original MGM lion survived the plane crash and survived four days on a diet of sandwiches and milk!\nView all 55 animals that start with L"}

The tassel doesn\u2019t just look good, it also relays messages such as \u201ccome this way.\u201d A tassel first appears when a lion is 5\u20137 months old.\nOnly about 1 in 8 male lions survive to adulthood. A majority of lions die shortly after being kicked out of their pride around the age of 2.\nWhen taking over a new territory and pride, some male lions will form a \u201ccoalition,\u201d or a group of 3 or 4 males. They will fight the resident male lion, often to the death, and kill all his cubs.\nIn 2002, much to the surprise of conservationists, a lioness adopted and protected a baby antelope. However, two weeks later, a male lion ate the baby while the lioness slept. The lioness appeared to be stricken with grief and walked around roaring in anger.\nAs tiger bones are becoming scarcer, poachers are turning toward lion bones to supply the intense demands of traditional medicine in Asia.\nTrophy hunting is devastating for lions for several reasons. First, when an adult male (the most sought-after trophy) is killed, his death destabilizes and may destroy an entire pride. Second, it wipes out the genes of the largest and most healthy males.\nA male lion can stretch up to 10 feet long and weigh 400\u2013500 pounds, about the same as eight or nine small children or over 50 pet cats. Females typically weigh 250\u2013350 pounds.\nAlthough the lion is known as \u201cthe king of the jungle,\u201d lions do not live in jungles. They live only in grasslands and plains.\nLions do not live in the jungle, even though they have been dubbed \"King of the Jungle\"\nIn Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s Thus Spoke Zarathustra , the lion symbolizes someone who has rebelled against traditional knowledge to create a new morality, which is known as the morality of the \u00dcbermensch .\nJust a century ago, there were over 200,000 lions living in Africa. Today, there are only 15,000\u201332,000 left.\nLions can run up to 50 mph, but only in a straight line and only for a few seconds at a time.

At night, a reflective coating on the back of their eyes helps capture moonlight. Additionally, they have a white patch of fur underneath their eyes that helps to reflect even more light.\nA lion\u2019s bite is 30 times stronger than the bite of a housecat.

The cost to kill a lion ranges from $5,400 to $48,000, depending on size and condition of the lion.\nMale lions may mate up to 100 times in two days to ensure that the female is pregnant. Each mating lasts only a few seconds. Female lions are pregnant with their cubs for about 3\u00bd months.\nLion prides are usually described as matriarchal, with communal care for the young. Most lionesses in a pride are related and remain in the same pride for life. Only two or three lions within a pride will be males, who are either brothers or pride-mates.\nA dominant male in a pride has two jobs. First, he must mate with all the females in the pride and, second, he must defend the pride from other males who want to take over. Male lions usually can keep control over a pride for 4 years.\nBy sleeping so much, lions can also decrease their energetic needs\nAmong all the big cats, lions nap the most, sleeping up to 22 hours a day. Additionally, male lions not only let the lioness do about 90% of the pride\u2019s hunting, they also have first dibs on eating the caught prey.\nLions hunt mostly at night and have about a 50% success rate.\nA lion pride\u2019s territory can stretch up to 100 square miles and can cover grasslands, open woodland, and scrubs.\nLionesses will often bring back a small animal, such as a baby antelope, alive so that the cubs can practice their hunting skills.\nLions come in several different colors, including tan, brown, yellow, and even red.\nLions live in prides of 2 to 40 members, with the average pride consisting of 13 animals.\nThere are two surviving species of lions: African and Asian. There are about six subspecies of African lions.\nA male lion\u2019s mane starts to grow at about 18 months old and will continue to grow until a lion is 5 years old.\nThe famous MGM lion is named \u201cLeo the Lion\u201d and has opened every one of its movies since 1929.

The only member of the big cat family that does is the leopard.\nAt the base of each lion\u2019s whisker is a black spot. The patterns these spots make are unique to each lion, similar to a human\u2019s fingerprint. Scientists are able to tell lions apart by looking at these patterns.\nWhen a lion curls up its top lip and pulls a funny face, it is usually using its Jacobson\u2019s organ, which is a small area on the roof of the mouth that allows a lion to \u201ctaste\u201d the air.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion Facts for Kids | African Animals | Big Cats", "url": "https://animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/lion/", "text": "Living in the grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, the lion is the second largest cat in the world. It is dwarfed slightly by the tiger, which is closely related and has a very similar body type.\nUnlike other cats, lions are very social animals. They live in groups, called prides, of around 30 lions. A pride consists of up to three males, a dozen related females, and their young. The size of the pride is determined by the availability of food and water. If resources are scarce, the pride becomes smaller.\nPride members keep track of one another by roaring. Both males and females have a very powerful roar that can be heard up to 8 km (5 mi.) away.\nMales and females take on very different roles in the pride. Male lions spend their time guarding their territory and their cubs. They maintain the boundaries of their territory, which can be as large as 260 sq. km (100 sq. mi.), by roaring, marking it with urine, and chasing off intruders. Their thick manes, a unique trait to male lions, protect their necks when they fight with challengers.\nFemale lions are the primary hunters of the group. They are smaller and more agile than males. But since their prey is still generally faster than them, they use teamwork to bring an animal down. Fanning out, they form a semicircle, with the smaller, weaker lionesses herding the prey towards the center. Then the stronger females knock the animal down and make the kill.\nLions usually hunt at night. Their prey includes antelopes, buffaloes, zebras, young elephants, rhinos, hippos, wild hogs, crocodiles and giraffes. But they also sometimes eat smaller prey like mice, birds, hares, lizards, and tortoises. They are not above stealing kills from other carnivores, like hyenas, wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards, or scavenging spoiled meat.\nAfter a successful hunt, all the lions in the pride share the meal. But there is a pecking order, with the adult males taking first claim, followed by the lionesses, and finally, the cubs.\nLions have a fast-working digestive system, which allows them to gorge themselves and then go for seconds shortly after. If available, they will drink water everyday. But they can go 4-5 days without drinking by obtaining moisture from the stomach contents of their prey.\nSpending 16-20 hours of the day sleeping or resting, lions are the laziest of the big cats. They can be found lying on their backs with their feet up or taking a snooze up in a tree. While lazing around, they are very affectionate towards one another, rubbing heads, grooming, and purring.\nLionesses give birth to 2-3 cubs at a time. Usually a couple females give birth around the same time. The cubs are then raised together, sometimes nursing communally.\nVulnerable to predators like hyenas, leopards, and black-backed jackals, cubs have a 60-70% mortality rate. They are sometimes trampled by large animals like buffaloes. Furthermore, when another group of male lions takes over a pride, they kill all the cubs so they can sire their own with the lionesses.\nFemale cubs stay with the group as they age. At around two years old, they become capable hunters. But young males are forced out of the pride at that age. They form bachelor groups and follow migrating herds until they are strong enough to challenge male lions of other prides. In general, a group of males stays in power in the pride for around three years before another bachelor group takes it over.\nConservation Status\nAfrican lions are considered vulnerable of extinction by the IUCN Red List. They are threatened by loss and fragmentation of habitat. They are also killed by humans in bravery rituals, as hunting trophies, for medicinal powers, or by ranchers protecting their livestock. Furthermore, they are susceptible to tick-borne diseases like canine distemper and babesia. Distemper is spread to lions by neighboring village dogs as well as hyenas. Babesia occurs during droughts, when malnourished prey is vulnerable to disease. The ticks spread to the lions after they kill the sick animal. The combination of distemper and babesia causes mass fatalities in lion populations.\nWhat You Can Do to Help\nYou can help save lions by donating to charities like National Geographic\u2019s Big Cat Initiative, Panthera\u2019s Project Leonardo, or the African Wildlife Foundation.\nLion Distribution\nLion Resources\nBlog Posts about the Lion"}

However, they are also often pretty misunderstood.\nHow much do you really know about this apex predator? It\u2019s safe to say you probably shouldn\u2019t get up too close to one \u2013 but there\u2019s every reason why you\u2019d want to learn more about them. Here are 36 fun facts about lions which are sure to fascinate you!\n1. Lions are seriously hefty!\nLions are some of the heaviest animals on the planet. Generally, females will weigh around 290lbs or 130kg when fully grown, while males can grow to 400lbs or 180kg on average.\nThe heaviest lion ever weighed tipped the scales at 826lbs or 375kg! However, despite lions generally being pretty huge in size, you\u2019ll find that tigers are even bigger en masse! Lions are, therefore, regarded as the second largest cats on the planet.\n2. Lions live for more than a decade\nThe average lifespan of a lion can vary, but they will generally live in the wild for around 12 years. This can differ in captivity, and it may differ from breed to breed.\nIn fact, you can probably tell where a lion is from just based on its coat. Dark-furred lions generally come from regions which are hotter or are more arid. However, you can also find those lions which have white fur!\n3. Lions are prideful animals \u2013 literally\nUnlike other cats \u2013 domesticated included \u2013 lions group together in prides. This makes them somewhat similar to canines, who group together in packs!\nPrides can vary in size, but generally, you\u2019ll see lions group together in up to 30 at a time. What decides the size? A few things \u2013 but they will group together wherever food and water is readily available.\nAs with domesticated cats and dogs, a lion will mark its territory with urine. This means that it will often urinate to create its own borders. That means to stay away!\n4. Lions don\u2019t actually live in jungles\nEver heard of the term \u2018king of the jungle\u2019? It\u2019s misleading. Lions don\u2019t live in jungle environments. They live in deserts, on grasslands and on green plains and fields. Who knows where that name first came from?\nRudyard Kipling\u2019s \u2018The Jungle Book\u2019 is at least accurate in this respect, as the lion is one of few wild animals not to receive a mention in the story or its adaptations. Instead, the fearsome Shere Khan represents the big cats.\n5. Female lions work the hardest\nFemale lions do most of the hard work. They go out and hunt and forage, while males keep guard and protect the pride.\nFemales, too, will bond for life. This means that any female cubs that grow up together are likely to still be friends later in life. It\u2019s rare that mother and daughter lions will ever split up, either.\n6. Lions are famously lazy!\nLions actually sleep or rest for most of the day. They\u2019re similar to domestic cats in this regard! They actually spend up to 20 hours a day being inactive. Not a bad life to lead!\n7. Lions\u2019 eyes are pretty unique\nWhile most cats have slit pupils, lions actually have round pupils instead. It\u2019s thought that this is because lions need to hunt for larger prey than domesticated cats, and those who may generally hunt around for smaller bites. This can also help them hunt better at night, making lions some of the best nocturnal hunters in the feline world.\nLions\u2019 eyes will change color while they grow. Cubs are generally born with blue eyes. However, these will change around three months into their lives, into the yellowy brown or amber that we know and love.\n8. There are lions pretty much everywhere\nLions are some of the best-travelled animals on the planet. You\u2019ll find most of them in the wilds of Africa these days, however, they were once native to India and Europe. You\u2019d even find them out in the US and Canada, for a time!\nIn fact, there are still a few lions that live out in India. These beasts can be found prowling around the Gir Forest. There are no more than 300 of them in total.\nThey are well-travelled thanks to their amazing adaptability. You\u2019ll find that a lion can easily live on arid plains and in think grass. However, again, you won\u2019t see them in any jungles or forests any time soon. Here, it\u2019s tigers and jaguars you need to worry about!\n9. Lions aren\u2019t the quietest of beasts!\nA lion\u2019s roar is famously loud. You\u2019ll know if a lion is nearby easily enough! However, you can hear a roar from up to five miles, or eight km, in the distance. Better start running!\n10. A lion\u2019s stamina is seriously impressive\nLions are also very fast but aren\u2019t great at running for long periods of time. A lion can normally reach a top speed of around 50mph, or 80-81 kph. You can\u2019t outrun them \u2013 but those that have a chance just need to count on the cats losing their breath mid-pace!\n11. Lions really gorge themselves!\nA lion is perfectly capable of eating around 15% of their weight in food if they are hungry enough.\nIt\u2019s thought that a lion can \u2013 and will \u2013 eat up to 18lbs of meat each day, though this can vary. They can probably swallow more if they want to!\n12. Lions make all kinds of sounds\nLions don\u2019t just roar. In fact, they make plenty of noises that domesticated cats do, too! They are known to hiss when angry and even meow when they want attention.\n13. The lion is a very popular symbol\nPlenty of countries refer to the lion as their national symbol. England, famously, trades on the pride of a lion. However, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ethiopia all use the big cats as their main symbols.\n14. Lions are versatile breeders\nLions can breed successfully with other types of big cat. For example, you can breed ligers and tigons, depending on which species is the male and which is the female.\nYou\u2019ll actually find that lions don\u2019t really have mating seasons. However, females are pretty clever about this and will mate when new males arrive to help populate a pride.\n15. And they take it pretty seriously\nWhen lions mate, they do so for three-day periods. They have breaks of around 30 minutes in between, however!\n16. Lions are under threat\nSadly, while you will still plenty of lions out in the wild, many will face their habitats threatened. In fact, lions are part of the IUCN Red List. This list helps to document all animals who are considered under threat from extinction.\n17. Lions are spring-footed!\nA lion can not only run pretty fast, it can jump far, too. This certainly helps when it comes to catching fleet-footed prey and when stamina is on the wane! An average lion can, apparently, leap up to 36 feet. That\u2019s a lot of ground to cover.\n18. Lion manes are seriously impressive\nNo other big cats have the fabulous hairstyles male lions are famous for. That\u2019s right \u2013 a lion\u2019s mane is completely unique to its species. In fact, the thicker the mane, the more likely a lion is going to find a mate.\nYou can actually estimate the rough age of a lion by looking at its mane. Older male lions will have darker manes than their younger counterparts.\n19. There are tons of lion breeds out in the wild\nThere are perhaps more types of lion in the wild than you imagine. People will normally be able to name Asian and African lions. However, there are around eight types in total. These can include Asiatic lions and Masai lions, as well as Ethiopian and Congo varieties.\n20. Most lions have brothers and sisters\nLion litters vary in size, but you will normally find a female lion gives birth to up to four cubs in a single litter. It\u2019s not uncommon for just one lion to be born.\n21. Lions don\u2019t use all of their paws\nWhile lions have heels like many mammals, they never actually make use of them while running! This, supposedly, helps them to move quicker. As mentioned, they need all the speed they can get!\nLion paws, too, are notable for their dew claws. These are generally used much in the same way that people use thumbs! They are fantastic at helping lions keep prey under control once they have caught them.\n22. Lions like a lot of space\nLion territories are famous for being absolutely massive. For example, you could find a lion territory that extends up to 100 square miles in size. As mentioned, lions can live almost anywhere, which means you are looking at a huge expanse of land for a pride to prowl across.\n23. Lions have odd head movements\nIf a lion wants to look in different directions, it will normally need to move its head. Their eyes may be large, but their pupils cannot move from side to side as easily as other animals\u2019 can.\n24. Lion poaching is a serious problem\nIt\u2019s estimated that around 600 lions alone are killed by trophy hunters each year. Despite widespread outcry, this is still an industry that leads to the export of lion bodies to the US and all over the world.\n25. Lion claws are truly massive!\nEver seen the length of a lion\u2019s claw? They are thought to be around the length of a human finger!\nLion claws are not fully retractable. They do, however, shrink back when they are at rest.\n26. A lion learns to roar as a cub\nLions can actually roar from a very young age, despite what certain Disney movies may tell you! Lions are able to start roaring from around the age of two years old.\n27. Lions scavenge more than prey\nLions are known scavengers, more so than active predators. In fact, most of a lion\u2019s diet is made up for food they sources while scavenging around!\n28. Buffalo kill scores of lions each year\nBelieve it or not, buffalo are known for causing a huge array of lion deaths. They are said to be the deadliest of all prey a lion may be known to hunt for.\n29. There\u2019s a lion gender divide!\nSome male lions won\u2019t actively live with females in their prides. Asiatic lions, for example, will only live alongside the other gender in their prides if they are looking to mate, or if they have killed a large number of prey.\n30. Male lion puberty is rather strange\nMale lions can start breeding from the age of two, however, they won\u2019t be able to act on this until they are around five years old and can therefore command a pride. Female lions, meanwhile, will normally have given birth by the age of four.\nA male lion can stay virile right up to 16 years of age.\n31. We discovered lions thousands of years ago\nEarly human species are thought to have started coming across lions as long ago as 32,000 years. This is, at least according to ancient cave paintings, the case.\n32. Lions have seriously big mouths\nA lion can open its full jaw up to a foot in size, which is likely enough to fit a human head into \u2013 hence some of the death-defying circus acts lion tamers used to endure.\n33. It\u2019s hard to damage a lion\u2019s stomach\nLions have loose skin around their abdomens. This is so that if they are kicked or scratched, very little damage is caused. Lions will generally chase after prey with hooves which are known to give a fair back-kick!\n34. There are fewer lions in Africa than you might think\nAfrica was once home to more than 200,000 lions. In the wild these days, you will probably only find around 10% of this living on the continent.\nAsiatic lions, however, appear to be reproducing at a healthy rate. It\u2019s thought that their population growth has increased by around 27% in the last decade. It will remain to be seen whether this upturn continues, though increased conservation is thought to be helping a great deal.\n35. Lions go for massive kills\nLions are able to kill huge prey. As mentioned, they often come into contact with buffalo, which can be very dangerous indeed! However, a lion is likely capable of hunting down and killing prey of up to 1000 lbs in weight.\nLions tend to pull down their prey by snatching at their ankles, meaning that they will often reach out for a scratch.\n36. The lion is a \u2018brave\u2019 beast\nThe lion is famously seen as a symbol of bravery. For example, King Richard \u2018The Lionheart\u2019 took his nickname from these majestic beasts. Turning things on their heads, the Cowardly Lion is a key character in the popular story The Wizard of Oz.\nFAQs about Lions\nWhat are lions scared of? Not much! Lions get the label of being \u2018brave\u2019 - however, it\u2019s more to do with the fact that they\u2019re not really under natural threat in the wild.\nAre lions stronger than tigers? Push come to shove, studies show that tigers would actually prove stronger than lions.\nIs the lion really the king of the jungle? Many believe that the elephant is the true monarch - as lions generally respect the biggest pachyderms!\nHow fast can a lion run?

{"animal": "lion", "title": "100 Greatest Animal Facts That Will Blow Your Mind - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/animal-facts/", "text": "Here\u2019s our big list of the 100 greatest animal facts. This includes some of the most asked, fun, surprising and crazy animal facts from across the animal kingdom. The loudest, deadliest, fastest, largest, most bizarre and random, are all here in our big animal fact list.\n1. The loudest animal in the world is a mere 2cm long, prawn. The Pistol Shrimp is capable of snapping its claw shut so rapidly, that it creates a bubble which collapses to produce a sonic blast, louder than a Concorde\u2019s sonic boom.\nThe shock wave can reach 230 decibels, also louder than the sound of a gunshot. The imploding bubble for split seconds also generates temperates of 4,400C, nearly as hot as the sun, killing its prey.\n2. Flamingos are not pink. They are born grey, their diet of brine shrimp and blue green algae contains a natural pink dye called canthaxanthin that makes their feathers pink.\nFlamingos in zoos often lost their colouring, until zoo keepers supplemented their diets.\n3. Otters \u201chold hands\u201d while sleeping, so they don\u2019t float away from each other.\nAnd it\u2019s super-cute. Look.\n4. Hummingbirds are the only known birds that can also fly backwards.\nThey often do this when retreating away from flowers.\n5. Dolphins use toxic pufferfish to \u2018get high\u2019.\nDolphins deliberately handle pufferfish causing them to release toxins as a defence mechanism. These toxins can be deadly in high doses, but also have a narcotic effect \u2013 and are a powerful hallucinogenic, which dolphins appear to enjoy.\n\ufeff\nA documentary witnessed them passing around pufferfish in a pod, before floating just underneath the water\u2019s surface, apparently \u2018mesmerised by their own reflections\u2019 afterwards.\n6. The Inland Taipan (also known as, the Western Taipan) is the most venomous snake in the world. A single bite contains enough venom to kill at least 100 fully grown men, and can kill within just 30 minutes, if left untreated.\nThey very rarely ever come in contact with humans, however. Every reliable identification of a snake bite victim from an Inland Taipan have been herpetologists, when handling or studying the snakes. They have all survived, due to successful treatment with antivenom.\n7. The worlds deadliest animal isn\u2019t a shark, bear or tiger, but something far smaller \u2013 the mosquito. According to the World Health Organization, 725,000 people are killed each year from mosquito-borne diseases, such as Malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever.\nThey outnumber every other animal in the world, apart from ants and termites. They can also be found in nearly every part of the world, which all add up in the risk they pose to humans.\n8. There are more than 1.4 billion insects for EACH HUMAN on the planet, according to recent estimates.\nAnts have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. Their population is estimated as 107\u2013108 billion alone, in comparison to approx. 7 billion humans on the planet.\n9. The shortest living animal in the world is the Mayfly. Its entire lifespan is just 24hrs.\nThe Mayfly reproduces and then dies, during that short 24hr period of life. Some species of Mayfly only live for 8-10 hours.\n10. The horned lizard is able to shoot blood from its own eyes, up to a distance of 3 feet away. The rather bizarre and disgusting act is a defensive mechanism to confuse predators.\nTheir blood contains a chemical that is noxious to predators, and this isn\u2019t its only trick \u2013 short-horned lizards are also capable of inflating their bodies up to twice their size to scare anything away.\n\ufeff\ufeff\n11. Roosters prevent themselves from going deaf due to their own loud crowing, by tilting their head backs when they crow, which covers their ear canal completely, serving as a built-in ear-plug.\nA study showed that their crowing averages over 100 decibels, which is roughly the same as running a chainsaw.\n12. Little is known about the elusive Giant squid, however the largest squid ever found measured over 50 feet and weighed nearly a tonne.\nTo put that in perspective, that\u2019s bigger than a bus.\n13. The pangolin is able to roll up into an armour-plated ball, so lions can\u2019t eat them.\nIf only this worked for poachers, who simply pick them up when they roll into a ball.\n\ufeff\n14. Koalas can sleep for up to 22 hours a day.\nKoala need more sleep than most animals, because their diet of eucalyptus leaves contain toxins, are very low in nutrition, and high in fibrous matter \u2013 so they take a large amount of energy to digest!\n15. Swifts spend most of their lives flying in the air, and can fly for almost an entire year, without ever landing.\nA study showed that over a 10-month period, a swift stopped for just 2 hours.\n16. Even after having its head cut off, a cockroach can still live for weeks .\nEven stranger, a cockroach\u2019s head can actually survive by itself for a few hours, too.\n17. A group of parrots is known as a pandemonium.\nAnd the collective noun for porcupines, is a prickle.\n18. Cows poo up to 15 times a day, which can be as much as 115 pounds of manure per day, or approximately 21 tons per year.\nThe large quantities are often put to good use, though \u2013 manure, to fertilizer, to fuel, or biogas to create electricity and heat for developing parts of the world.\n19. Panda\u2019s must eat 25 \u2013 90 pounds (12-38 kg) of bamboo every day to meet their energy needs.\nThis is because bamboo contains very little nutritional value, so they have to eat it in vast quantities to survive. Although the giant panda possess the digestive system of a carnivore, they have evolved to depend almost entirely on bamboo.\n20. A Blue Whales tongue can weigh as much as a car, or a small adult elephant.\nA Blue Whales tongue can weigh approx. 2.7 tonnes, or 6,000 \u2013 8,000 pounds (2,720 \u2013 3,630 kg).\n21. The longest living, verified animal is a Madagascar radiated tortoise, which died at an age of 188 years in May 1965.\nHowever, there might be even older. Adwaita, an Aldabra giant tortoise, died at an estimated age of 255 in March 2006 in Alipore Zoo, Kolkata, India. If verified, it will have been the oldest terrestrial animal in the world.\n22. The fastest land animal on the planet is a cheetah. It can reach speeds of up to 75 mph (120 kph).\nWhile the Peregrine Falcon is the fastest bird, with a diving speed of 242 mph (389 kph). The Black Marlin is the fastest sea animal, and can swim up to 80 mph (130 kph).\n23. Baby elephants suck their trunks for comfort.\nJust like babies and young children suck their thumbs, awwww.\nPhoto courtesy of Darkroomillusions.\n24. The Nile crocodiles jaws can apply 5,000 pounds of pressure per square inch \u2013 the strongest bite of any animal in the world.\nA human\u2019s jaw produces 100 pounds of pressure per square inch in comparison. A crocodiles bite is 10 times more powerful than that of a great white shark\n25. Axolotl are able to regenerate lost limbs and body organs.\nMexican walking fish can regrow the same limb up to 5 times, and even regenerate parts of its brain.\n26. The Giant Pacific Octopus has 3 hearts, 9 brains and blue blood.\nThey are also able to change their colour and texture to camouflage themselves in a blink of an eye.\n27. A flea can jump distances 200 times their body length.\nThey are able to jump 10 inches (25cm) vertically and up to 18 inches (45 cm) horizontally, making them one of the planets best jumpers relative to its size. It\u2019s equal to a human jumping as high as the Empire State Building in New York.\n28. The male seahorse goes through pregnancy and gives birth to babies. They are the only animal on earth where the male carries the baby rather than the female.\nThe male seahorse has a pouch on its stomach in which to carry babies\u2014as many as 2,000 at a time.\n29. Pufferfish can contain a tetrodoxin, a toxin that is up to 1,200 times more deadly than cyanide to humans. There is enough toxin in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans, and there is no known antidote.\nAmazingly despite this, some pufferfish meat is considered a delicacy in Japan. The meat called Fugu, is expensive and only prepared by licenced chefs with over 3 years of rigorous training who remove toxic parts of the meat for diners.\n30. The loudest animal relative to size is the Water Boatman, which measures at just 12mm long, but can produce 99 dB of sound by rubbing its genitalia across its abdomen.\nThis is the equivalent noise level of operating a circular saw, or a drill.\n31. The howler monkey is the loudest land animal. Its calls can be heard from 3 miles (5 km) away.\nAt its peak, the howler monkey can produce sounds that reach 140 decibels. That\u2019s as noisy as a jet engine, on take off!\n32. There is an average of 50,000 spiders per acre in green areas.\nThere\u2019s over 45,000 known spider species, with the venom of a few only known to be dangerous to humans.\n33. The aptly named colossal squids eyes are as large as a basketball.\nThis allows them to detect the faint light of a predator from over 400 feet (120 metres).\n34. White-tailed jackrabbits are the greatest land jumpers, having been recorded leaping an astonishing 21ft (6.4m) vertically.\nThat\u2019s higher than 3 average sized men all stood on top of each other. This large species of hare can also run up to 35mph (55kph) when escaping predators.\n35. Grey-headed Albatross can circle the globe in only 46 days.\nThe incredible round-the-world journey covers 14,000 miles over the 46 day period at a steady 13mph. They perform this feat by making various pit-stops along the way.\n36. Giraffes are the tallest land animal in the world, reaching heights of 19ft (5.8 m). The ostrich is the world\u2019s tallest bird. It can grow up to 9 feet (2.7m) tall.\nOver 2 metres (7ft) of a giraffes total size is its famously long neck, which helps it reach leaves in tall trees.\n37. An ostrich legs are so powerful that their kicks can kill a lion.\nOr a human! Each two-toed foot has a long, sharp claw \u2013 making them formidable weapons. Animals often end up running away from the large bird.\n38. The dementor wasp paralyses cockroaches with venom to its head, turning them into a zombie-like state. The toxins leave the cockroach unable to control its own movements, which incredibly makes it run into the wasps nest to meet its demise.\nThe venom is thought to cut brain activity that makes cockroaches sense fear and run away to safety. The dementor wasp will then lay eggs on the cockroach to act as an incubator for its young.\n39. More than half of all pigs in the world are kept by farmers in China.\nThere are over 440 million pigs in China. United States in comparison has a mere 73 million pigs.\n40. Polar bears have jet black skin under their white fur coats.\nIt helps them absorb heat to keep warm, while the white fur helps provides camouflage in the snowy and icy environment they live.\n41. Giant anteaters consume up to 35,000 ants and termites in a single day.\nThey use their long sticky tongues to slurp up hundreds of ants per minute. Interestingly, anteaters purposefully never destroy an ant nest, preferring to leave some ants alive to rebuild, so it can return and feed again in the future.\n42. The little known pangolin is the worlds most poached and trafficked animal.\nThis is due to the high demand of their scales and meat in Asian cultures. 70% of Chinese citizens believe pangolin products have medicinal value, when its been scientifically proven to be false.\n43. Great white sharks can detect a drop of blood in 25 gallons (100 litres) of water and can even sense tiny amounts of blood from 3 miles (5 km) away.\nThey use their acute sense of smell to detect blood using an organ called the \u2018olfactory bulb\u2019.\n44. The Naked Mole-Rat can live in an almost zero oxygen atmosphere.\nIncredibly, in a zero oxygen environment, the Naked Mole-Rat can still survive for up to 20-minutes without suffering any harm at all.\n45. The smell of a skunk is powerful enough for a human to smell it up to 3.5 miles (5.6 km) away.\nThe foul smelling spray from a skunk can also cause skin irritation and even temporary blindness.\n46. The most venonmous fish in the world is the 30cm Stonefish.\nStonefish have 13 sharp fin spines on their back, each with two venom glands. Their stings are extremely painful, can be lethal to humans, and mostly occur as a result of stepping on the creature.\n47. Only 5% of cheetah cubs survive to adulthood.\nA study in the 90\u2019s in the Serengeti found that 95% of cheetah cubs died before reaching adulthood. Many deaths were due to Lions, but also other predators and disease.\n48. A tigers rear legs are so powerful, that they have been found remaining to stand even after death.\nTigers have been witnessed to have been shot, bled out, and died \u2013 and remained standing throughout.\n49. A Rhinoceros\u2018s horns are made of \u2018keratin\u2019, the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails.\nSome species of Rhinos have two horns, while others just have a single horn.\n50. The Alpine Swift is able to stay airborne for over 6 months without touching down.\nIt holds the world record for the longest recorded uninterrupted flight by a bird, at over 200 days in the air as it hunted flying insects on its wintering range in the skies over West Africa.\n51. The Edible Dormouse (Glis glis) is able to hibernate the longest \u2013 up to 11-months of the year when food availability is low.\nTo be able to pull of this feat, they double or even triple their body weight before hibernation. During hibernation they are able to reduce their metabolic rate and the animal may stop breathing for periods of up to an hour at a time.\n52. Japanese Macaques play with snowballs for fun.\nThese snow monkeys have been observed rolling up snowballs, then pushing them down hills just for the heck of it. Others gather lumps of snow in a ball and carry them around, proudly sometimes to the envy of other monkeys who try to steal it.\n53. Sperm whales are the world\u2019s largest predator.\nThey can be up to 18m long and weigh up to 53 tonnes. These giant whales dive down to almost 3000m below the surface where they hunt giant squid. Giant squid can be the same size or bigger than sperm whales and will fight viciously with them. Adult whales can be seen with scars on their heads from the beaks of giant squid.\n54. The largest insect to ever live was a \u201cdragonfly\u201d with a wingspan of over 75cm (2 and a half feet) across.\nThey are called Meganeuropsis and were around 247 million years ago. They were proficient predators, with large mandibles that they used to capture fish, amphibians and insects.\n55. Koala\u2019s have fingerprints almost identical to human.\nIt is so hard to distinguish between the fingerprints of koalas and humans that even under a microscope it is hard to tell. There are even reported cases of a koala\u2019s fingerprints confusing forensics at crime scenes.\n56. Greenland sharks are the longest living vertebrates on earth, with one individual thought to be over 400 years old\nGreenland sharks are giant, reaching up to 5m in length, and live in the cold deep waters of the North Atlantic. They are rarely seen, and little is known about them.\n57. The blood \u2018Dracula ant\u2019 has the fastest recorded animal movement when it snaps its mandible.\nThis cannibalistic ant can go from zero to 200mph in 0.000015 seconds when it snaps its mandibles, that\u2019s roughly 5,000 times faster than humans blink. 5 This is the fastest recorded movement in the animal kingdom.\n58. The box jellyfish is considered the most venomous marine species in the world.\nThese cube shaped jellyfish have long tentacles and can be over 3m in length. Their toxin, delivered via stinging cells in their tentacles, is so potent that many die before they can even reach the shore.\n59. The Japanese Spider Crab has the longest leg span of any arthropod.\nFrom the tip of one claw to the other can be as long as almost 4m! Japanese spider crabs have 10 legs stretching out from a central body, giving it its spider like appearance. They live deep in the oceans south of Japan.\n60. Some albatrosses are lesbians.\nAlbatrosses form bonds for life, returning to the same place every year to raise their young. Some of these bonds are between two female albatrosses, with a study finding that in one breeding area 31% of pairs were two females.\n61. Some corvids (crows, rooks, ravens etc,) can understand physics.\nCorvids are highly intelligent. They can use tools, solve puzzles, recognise faces, and even understand physics. Tests show that rooks have the same level of understanding of physics as a 6-month-old baby, which is higher than some apes.\n62. Sheep can recognise faces.\nAs social animals, sheep are capable of recognising familiar and unfamiliar faces. Studies even suggest that they miss other sheep when they are taken away for a long time afterwards.\n63. Tardigrades can survive in space and go without eating for more than 10 years.\nTardigrades are microscopic animals with crazy endurance abilities. They can survive in temperatures as high as 149oC or as low as -272oC and pressures 6 times more intense than the bottom of the ocean. They also look like tiny bears!\n64. Hoatzin\u2019s are the only bird species with a ruminant digestive system, and they smell like cow-dung.\nA ruminant digestive system is one that uses fermentation to digest food, cows being a well- known example of this. It\u2019s this digestive system that gives it it\u2019s lovely cow-dung smell. These birds are found in the amazon and have a dinosaur like appearance to them.\n65. Echidna\u2019s are relatives of duck-billed platypuses and have a beak, spikes, a kangaroo-like pouch, and lays eggs.\nThey are small at just 30\u201345cm and are known as spiny anteaters. One of the few egg-laying mammals, echidna lay a tiny egg which is then transferred into a kangaroo-like pouch where it then hatches.\n66. The desperate leaf chameleon is less than 3cm long.\nOne of the tiniest reptiles in the world, this tiny chameleon is native only to Madagascar. It can change colour to match its environment and lays huge eggs compared to its body size. They are named \u201cdesperate\u201d due to their status as critically endangered.\n67. The Yangtze giant softshell turtle is the biggest freshwater turtle in the world.\nIt weighs between 150 to 220 kilograms (330 to 485 pounds) and is over 100cm (39in) in length. They are found primarily in the area of the Yangtze River in China.\n68. The Mariana snailfish is the deepest fish in the ocean, living up to around 8,000m below the surface.\nThey live down in the deepest trenches of the ocean where they hunt invertebrates, such as crustaceans and shrimp.\n69. Pea Crabs are miniature crabs that spend their whole lives inside oysters, clams, and mussels.\nNames so because it is the size of a pea, this tiny crab relies entirely on its host for food.\n70. The shoebill stork can swallow baby crocodiles whole.\nThese huge birds are over a meter tall (up to 5 feet) and have a wingspan of more than 2 m (almost 8 feet!). Its name comes from its huge beak which is over 20cm long and almost that wide. Along with lungfish, it also eats baby turtles and baby crocodiles whole.\n71. Lungfish are the only fish that have both lungs and gills.\nThis allows them to survive when the water in their ponds/lakes dries up.\n72. Electric eels are in fact not eels, and give a shock strong enough to knock out a horse.\nIn the Tennessee Aquarium an electric eel\u2019s tank has been hooked up to a computer programmed to send out a tweet whenever the eel produces enough electricity.\n73. The yellowhead jawfish incubates its eggs in its mouth.\nThe male gathers up all of the eggs once they\u2019ve been fertilised and stores them in his mouth until they hatch.\n74. The patu digua is thought to be this smallest spider in the world at just 0.37 mm.\nThis Colombian spider is about one fifth the size of the head of a pin.\n75. Vampire bats share blood with their friends.\nVampire bats need to eat blood at least every 48 hours to survive. Bats will share blood after a good meal with another bat that\u2019s fed them in the past.\n76. The U.S. military trained bottlenose dolphins.\nBottlenose dolphins were used in both the Vietnam and the Gulf to detect enemy swimmers trying to plant explosives on ships.\n77. Wojtek the bear was a corporal in the polish military during WWII.\nWojtek was brought by polish shoulders while in Iran. He was made an officer so that he was allowed rations and eventually was promoted to corporal. He helped out by carrying boxes of ammunition.\n78. Horned lizards shoot blood out of their eyes.\nTo scare of predators, this lizard shoots blood out of its eyes.\n79. Cuckoo birds hide their eggs in the nests of other species.\nThe other bird species then raises the cuckoo chick as if it were its own, and the cuckoo mother doesn\u2019t have to do any of the work.\n80. Elephants mourn their dead.\nElephants will return to the place where family members died and stand in silence over the bones, sometimes bowing their heads.\n81. Meerkat parents train their offspring to hunt scorpions.\nThey will bring back dead or almost dead scorpions back to the younger ones so that they can practice killing them without getting stung.\n82. Only 3-5% of mammals are monogamous.\nThe majority of mammals are not monogamous, making humans unusual.\n83. Gorilla\u2019s have been seen dismantling traps set by poachers.\nPoaching is a big problem for gorillas, but young gorillas have learnt how to trap and dismantle snares.\n84. The earliest found depictions of dogs come from 8,000 years ago.\nDogs have been human-kinds best friend for a long time, with a carving in a rock face in Saudi Arabia showing a man hunting with 13 dogs. Two of them even have leads!\n85. Cat\u2019s were domesticated 9,500 years ago in Ancient Egypt.\nThey were worshiped in Ancient Egypt and some historians report that it was illegal to kill a cat.\n86. Emperor penguins are the world\u2019s biggest penguins, and they trek 50\u2013120 km (31\u201375 m) across the Antarctic to reach breeding colonies.\nThese impressive penguins reach 100 cm (39 in) in length and weigh 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). They breed during winter, when they emerge from their more natural habitat in the ocean to trek long distances over treacherous ice.\n87. Yaks are specially adapted to high altitudes, with a huge lung capacity and small red blood cells.\nNative originally to Tibet, these giant oxen-like animals live at high altitudes in the Himalayas (4,000\u20136,000 metres). They are specifically adapted to the low oxygen levels with a lung capacity that is ~3 times that of normal cattle, and have smaller red blood cells to improve oxygen transport.\n88. Cuvier\u2019s Beaked whales are one of the deepest diving mammals and can collapse their lungs to survive the high pressure.\nOne of the deepest diving mammals, one individual was recorded diving down to 2,992 m (9,816ft) below the surface. The pressure at these depths is so high that in order to survive it they have to collapse their lungs.\n89. Orangutans are the heaviest tree-dwelling animals.\nThere are three species of orangutan and adult males of all three typically weigh around 75kg (165lb) while females are ~37 kg (82 lb). They are ~1.5m(5ft) tall and have a huge arm span of ~2m (6ft). They spend most of their time up in the canopy, making them the heaviest tree-dwelling animal.\n90. Chimpanzees are very intelligent and make all kinds of tools.\nFor example, some use long sticks to fish out termites from their mounds. Others have been recorded creating \u201cspears\u201d to hunt bushbabies!\n91. Shrike\u2019s impale their prey on sticks to save them for later.\nAlso known as \u201cbutcherbirds\u201d they are famous for being fairly brutal songbirds. They catch all kinds of animals, including crickets, lizards, and small birds, and impale them on sticks to save them for later.\n92. Atlantic wolffish are terrifying predators reaching up to 5 feet in length.\nThey have very sharp teeth and a powerful bite, making them powerful predators. Atlantic wolffish use this bite force to crush the hard shells of molluscs and crustaceans.\n93. The wood frog spends 7 months of the year frozen.\nThese Alaskan frogs freeze almost completely at the start of winter, with two-thirds of their body water turning into ice. To all intents and purposes, they seem dead; their heart stops beating, and their blood flow stops. However, once winter starts to thaw so do they and they hop back to life.\n94. Certain animals have anti-freeze proteins that allow them to survive extreme temperatures.\nThese anti-freeze proteins prevent water in the cells of the animals from crystalising and forming ice. Examples of animals with this superpower include the winter flounder and the eelpout.\n95. Honeypot ants swell up to a huge size with food.\nHoneypot ants have to be seen to be believed. During wet season, certain ants consume huge amounts of nectar, making their abdomens swell up to the size of a grape. Then, during dry season, they provide the other ants with food by throwing the nectar back up again. Yum!\n96. The lesula, discovered in 2007, has giant human like eyes and a blue bottom.\nThis relatively newly discovered monkey lives in the Congo. Their eyes are very distinctive because of their human-like appearance, as are their bright blue bums.\n97. The Donald Trump caterpillar looks identical to the ex-president\u2019s hair.\nThis species of caterpillar, prior to 2016, was known as the Flannel Moth Caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis). It gained popularity as it is very furry and bright orange, giving it an uncanny resemblance to Trump\u2019s hair (wig?). This \u2018fur\u2019 however, is actually composed of multiple venomous \u2018hairs\u2019. Grabbing hold of one of these caterpillars is a painful experience.\n98. Frilled sharks are 2-meter-long living fossils that eat their prey whole.\nFrilled sharks are considered living fossils, meaning they\u2019ve gone unchanged for a long period of time and most of their closest relatives can only be found in the form of fossils. They get their names from their \u201cfrilly\u201d gills and they are predators, which swallow their prey whole.\n99. Giant vampire bats lived 100,000 years ago and had a wingspan of 50cm (20 inches).\nThese giant bats were roughly 30% larger than the modern vampire bats. The remains of one were recently found in a cave in Argentina.\n100. There are an estimated 8.7 million species on earth and more than 80% of them are undiscovered.\nBased on current data, complex statistics, and models we can predict how many species there are on Earth, telling us how many are still left to be found. It will likely take another 500 years to find them all."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "13 Mind-Blowing Lion Facts! - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/13-mind-blowing-lion-facts/", "text": "Lions are one of the most incredible animals on the planet. They\u2019re not only one of the largest predators in the world, but they also hunt in large groups. We\u2019ve compiled a list of the most mind-blowing lion facts you can find. You\u2019ll discover everything from a lion that survived a plane crash to why lions can be louder than football stadiums. Let\u2019s get started with this list of 13 mind-blowing lion facts!\n1.) The largest lion ever recorded weighed 690 pounds!\nThe largest lion ever recorded weighed 690 pounds. It was shot in South Africa in 1936. For perspective, the largest wolf ever recorded weighed \u201cjust\u201d 175 pounds.\nAncient lions could reach even larger sizes. The American lion, which went extinct about 11,000 years ago could have reached up to 1,153 pounds!\nMale lions on the hunt! Blue Slate Films/Shutterstock.com\n2.) Lions sleep for more than 20 hours per day!\nYou might enjoy getting 8 or 9 hours of sleep per night, but a lion getting that amount of sleep wouldn\u2019t be able to function. Hunting prey is extremely energy intensive, so lions sleep large amounts of time to conserve energy between hunts.\nIn total, lions sleep about 20 to 21 hours per day! Species like lions that have few natural predators have the luxury of sleeping more. Herbivores generally sleep less, as species like elephants and giraffes sleep as little as two hours per day in the wild.\n3.) Lions, tigers, and bears can become best friends!\nFile this one under heart-warming.\nAfter police raided a house in Atlanta in 2001, they found the criminal kingpin was illegally keeping a lion, tiger, and bear cub that were all malnourished. The three cubs were taken to Noah\u2019s Ark Animal Sanctuary, where they recovered from their poor care.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s amazing: the three apex predators had bonded during the experience and became \u201cfriends\u201d for life. They lived in the same environment and maintained an incredible bond until the passing of Leo the lion and Shere Khan the tiger. Today, only Baloo the bear remains. He attended the funerals of both his friends and will be buried next to them so the trio can remain together for good.\n4.) A lion\u2019s roar can be heard for more than 5 miles!\nHere\u2019s a lion fact that\u2019s sure to impress, lion roars reach about 114 decibels! Big plays during football games average about 111.2 decibels, which makes a lion\u2019s roar even louder than a packed football stadium!\nNo other big cat can roar as loud as a lion, and their roars ring out for more than 5 miles.\na lion corned by hyenas Mark Sheridan-Johnson/Shutterstock.com\n5.) The world\u2019s most famous lion \u2013 the MGM lion \u2013 survived a plane crash!\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a James Bond film, then you\u2019ve seen the distinctive MGM lion roaring at the beginning of the film. MGM trademarked the lion in 1916, and it has been an iconic feature at the beginning of their films since then.\nHowever, you might not know that the MGM lion once survived a plane crash! In 1927, MGM was flying their lion mascot across the country to raise publicity when tragedy struck. In a flight from San Diego to New York the flight carrying the lion crushed.\nAmazingly, the MGM lion survived the crash and survived for four days until rescued. During the time it fed on sandwiches and milk from the crashed plane. The lion became known as \u201cLeo the Lucky\u201d and survived a number of other mishaps including a sinking ship, an explosion in the MGM studio, and multiple train wrecks.\n6.) The price of admittance to the London Zoo may have been a cat or dog\u2026 That would be fed to the lions\nPersonally, I just prefer paying $20 to enter a zoo, but times were different back then!\nHundreds of years ago, if you lived in Europe there was simply no way to see \u201cexotic\u201d animals like lions aside from pictures that were often poor representations. For that reason, when royals captured rare animals from across the world, they were a significant attraction. The Royal Menagerie in London kept a variety of animals from across the world during its time.\nIn his book The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century, author Wilfrid Blunt wrote:\nIn the eighteenth century the public was admitted to the Tower menagerie on the payment of three-halfpence or, alternatively, the provision of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions.\n7.) Lions have lost 94% of their habitat and more than 90% of their population\n5,000 years ago, lions roamed north of Greece into Eastern Europe, across Iran and into India, and across all of Africa.\nToday, lions have lost more than 94% of their historic range. They have just one small population left in a single national park in India. In Africa, they\u2019ve been largely wiped out from West and North Africa. Remaining lion populations live in pockets across South and East Africa.\nMore troubling is that their decline continues.\nBetween 1993 and 2014 the ICUN estimated that the global lion population decreased by 42%.\nIn the early 1960s, it was estimated 100,000 lions lived across Africa.\nIn the early 20th century, estimates placed the lion population at between 200,000 and one million lions.\nToday, the global lion population is estimated at about 20,000. This means the lion population has dropped anywhere from 90% to 98% since the beginning of the 20th century.\nGUDKOV ANDREY/Shutterstock.com\n8.) Lions are big hunters, but they have tiny hearts\nLions are one of the largest predators in the world, but they do have limitations. For example, their heart weight just 1,175 grams, which is small for their body size. Due to a smaller heart and lungs, lions aren\u2019t endurance hunters. Instead they rely on both stealth and teamwork to surprise their prey. Lions can run incredibly fast \u2013 up to 50 miles per hour \u2013 but only in short bursts. This means that lions need to get close to their prey before attacking or force prey into other lions waiting to pounce.\n9.) Lions are the only big cat to live in social groups\nLook among other big cats and you\u2019ll see solitary hunters. Tiger, jaguars, and leopards all hunt individually. Only lions live and hunt in social groups called prides.\nPrides are composed mostly of females. A typical pride may have up to a dozen females, no more than three males, and also lion cubs. Males without a pride can form coalitions that hunt and live together. Which brings us to our next lion fact\u2026\n10.) An alliance of male lions killed more than 100 rivals and ruled an area 7 times the size of Manhattan!\nAs just noted, male lions without a pride will often form coalitions that can rule over large swaths of land. In 2006 a coalition of male lions formed in the Sabi Sand region of Kruger National Park in South Africa.\nThe coalition \u2013 known as Mapogo Coalition \u2013 came to include 6 male lions which ruled over 170,000 acres. The lions were ruthless, and killed more than 100 rival lions and cubs and ruled over 8 separate prides. As you can imagine, alliances of male lions are tenuous and involve frequent clashes. The Mapogo coalition eventually split in 2010 into two groups. These smaller groups were picked off by rival alliances, with the final member of the group passing away in 2012.\nMale lion alliances can control vast amounts of territory The Len/Shutterstock.com\n11.) Young lions practice role playing\nOnce lions age, they tend to sleep all day and conserve their energy. However, young lions are much more playful. Youthful lions will role play with one another, which is more than just playing, but helps them develop their hunting techniques. Female lions will watching this role play and determine whether young lions are best suited to chase, corner, or catch and kill prey on future hunts.\n12.) Lions used to have the largest range of any mammal \u2013 outside of humans!\nScientists believe that 13,000-plus years ago, lions were the most widespread mammal outside of humans. That\u2019s because in addition to today\u2019s single remaining species of lion, there were two others:\nCave lions: Which lived across the European steppe across most of modern Europe, Russia, and into Alaska.\nAmerican lions: Lived across parts of Canada, most of the. modern United States, and into Mexico\nBoth these species went extinct between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago at the same time megafauna like mammoths and woolly rhinos went extinct. In addition to these now extinct species, many subpopulations of lions such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion occupied wider geographic ranges that extended far beyond where lions live today. Make sure to give our full guide on types of lions a read for the background on all types of lions, past and present.\n13.) Lions can gorge incredible amounts at meals\nMost humans eat about 2% of their body weight per day. Think about how full you\u2019d be eating a two pound steak in just one sitting!\nLions eat more infrequently than people, but when they do eat, they can gorge. Male lions can eat up to 70 pounds in a single meal. This amount of food can be about 10% to 20% of their body weight!"}

Not actually big cats, these American lions are known for their uniqueness: from their world records to their house-cat-like qualities. Don\u2019t believe us? Here are 11 mountain lion facts that will show you we aren\u2019t \u201clion\u201d about how incredible these cats are!\n1.Mountain lions have more names than any other animal in the world\nMountain lions are known by many names Ultrashock/Shutterstock.com\nDid you know that mountain lions, pumas, and cougars are all the same animal? As of now, mountain lions hold the record for having the most names with 40 different nicknames. Some of the most common mountain lion alternative names are\nPuma\nCougar\nPanther\nCatamount\nPainter\nMountain screamer\nMexican lion\nRed lion\nGhost cat\nAmerican lion.\nWhile you may see it known mostly as a mountain lion in day-to-day life, often, scientists prefer to call these stealthy predators \u201cpumas\u201d. This is because of their scientific name, which is Puma concolor.\nMountain lions have lots of names, but it\u2019s important not to get them confused with other American cats, such as bobcats or lynxes. While still cool cats, these are different animals than the mountain lion.\n2. Mountain lions don\u2019t roar\n\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t communicate in plenty of other ways! Mountain lions\u2019 have a different larynx than most of the big cats you may be used to, such as tigers and lions. As a result, they communicate in different ways, such as chirping, growling, shrieking, and even purring.\n3. Mountain lions live in nearly every ecosystem in America\nA mountain lion feeding Ipatov/Shutterstock.com\nWith a diverse diet and the ability to live in everywhere from rain forests to deserts to snowy mountains, you\u2019ll be able to find mountain lions in almost every ecosystem in North and South America.\n4. The largest mountain lion ever recorded weighed 276 pounds\nWhile mountain lions rarely weigh over 200 pounds, one record-holding ghost cat weighed in at 276. pounds! For comparison, that\u2019s more than a giant panda, which averages at about 245 pounds. It\u2019s also about the average size of a female lion, which weighs about 280 pounds.\n5. Mountain lion cubs have blue eyes and spots\nA mountain lion cub showing off its distinctive spots Chris Desborough/Shutterstock.com\nIf you ever found a mountain lion cub out in the wild, you probably wouldn\u2019t recognize it!\nWhen mountain lions are first born, and even while they\u2019re growing up, they look vastly different than their adult counterparts. The most noticeable differences? Their blue eyes and dark spots on their fur. As they mature, their eyes will shift to yellow and their spots will fade into their iconic tawny coat, becoming almost unrecognizable over the course of just a few weeks. If you enjoyed this fun fact, baby lions exhibit the exact same traits!\n6. One subspecies of the mountain lion is highly endangered\nWhile mountain lions are known for their ability to live in almost every ecosystem found in North and South America, there is one subspecies that has been endangered for several decades.\nThe Florida panther, one subspecies of the mountain lion, has been listed as endangered since 1967. One of the main causes identified has been human development, which is destroying the mountain lion\u2019s habitat and making it more difficult for them to access food. Roads also pose a large threat to mountain lions, especially since they tend to roam at night where they may not be seen by drivers until it\u2019s too late.\nHowever, decades of conservation efforts have helped the population increase from a few dozen to the 120-230 adult mountain lions currently alive as estimated by Florida Wildlife Control in 2021.\n7. Mountain lions can run up to 50 mph\nMountain Lion Close Up (Felis Concolor) Kwadrat/Shutterstock.com\nOne of the coolest facts about mountain lions? Proportionally, they have the largest legs out of all of the members of the feline family. This helps mountain lions adapt to a variety of situations and terrains \u2013 but most importantly, it helps them reach impressive speeds of up to 50 miles per hour!\nEven though they can only maintain this top speed for a short period of time, they are able to maintain speed up to 10 mph for long-distance sprints.\nThis is one reason why if you ever encounter a mountain lion, you should never run away \u2013 after all, at 50mph, they won\u2019t let you get too far. Instead, stay calm, stay upright, and back away slowly. Making yourself as large and loud as possible can also help, since mountain lions are opportunistic hunters and most likely won\u2019t want to put up a fight.\n8. Mountain lions attack are rare\nThey\u2019re so rare, in fact, that many statistic experts say that you\u2019re more likely to be struck by lightning than suffer a mountain lion attack. This is mainly due to the fact that human and mountain lion encounters are so rare, and when they do occur, mountain lions are easily startled off.\n9. Mountain lions are great at jumping\nMountain Lion (Felis Concolor) Jumping a Canyon Christina Moraes/Shutterstock.com\nMountain lions\u2019 large legs allow them to do more than just run fast \u2013 they can also jump up to 18 feet off the ground! This is important for hunting, especially since mountain lions rely on ambushing their prey for success.\n10. Mountain lion tracks don\u2019t have claw marks\nOne of the easiest ways to identify a mountain lion track compared to other animals? Look for claws \u2013 or rather, the lack thereof.\nLike most other species in the cat family, mountain lions have the neat ability to retract their claws. This means that, unless you\u2019re looking on particularly rough terrain, you won\u2019t usually see the sign of claws in their tracks.\nAnother way to tell if the tracks you\u2019re dealing with are a mountain lion or not is to look for the notable \u201cM\u201d shape of their main paw pad. Remember: \u201cM\u201d is for mountain lion!\n11. Mountain lions are an important part of indigenous culture\nMountain Lion (Felis Concolor) Cub Nagel Photography/Shutterstock.com\nKnown for their power and grace, mountain lions are common symbols in indigenous American culture, from mythology to art. While some indigenous peoples view mountain lions as symbols of bad omens, many see these apex predators as sacred and revered animals, such as the Inca people and the Cherokee people."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "15 Roar-some Facts About The Lion That Kids Will Love", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/lion-facts", "text": "Lion Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is a lion?\nThe lion is a type of big cat which is found in the African or Asiatic savanna and grasslands. Everyone knows that lions are carnivorous animals and like to eat a huge quantity of meat. They are known to hibernate during the daytime and venture out for food at nighttime.\nWhat class of animal does a lion belong to?\nThe lion belongs to the mammal class of animals. There are two known sub-species of lions known as African lions and Indian Lions. Most of the lion population is concentrated in Africa but a small population of wild lions can be found in the Gir Forest of India.\nHow many lions are there in the world?\nThere are about 20,000 lions left in the world, males and females combined. The lion population has become extinct in about 26 African countries. The African lion can be found in 28 African countries and the Asian lion can be found only in one Asian country, India, which include six protected complexes to support more than 1000 lions.\nWhere does a lion live?\nLions live in a wide range of regions but prefer grassy plains, savannahs, scrub bordering rivers, and open woodlands with bushes. They are rarely found in dense rainforests or closed forests. These wild cats can be found at high elevations like Mount Elgon, which is 3600m above sea level and close to the snow line of Mount Kenya. They are more often spotted in the open savanna grassland with scattered acacia trees for shade. The Asiatic lion is found only in and around Gir National Park in Gujarat in western India. The habitat over there is a mixture of dry savannah forest with dry deciduous scrub forest. White lions have a rarity that has a genetic condition called leucism. White lions are spotted at the Kruger National Park and Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa. They are mostly held in captivity and bred in these camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.\nWhat is a lion's habitat?\nHistorically lion prides were found in much of Africa, parts of Europe, and Asia. Today, most lions live in the sub-Saharan region of Africa and only small population of the wild lions can be found in Gir Forest of India. Lions adapt well to very dry climates as they get most of their moisture from their food. A pride prefers open woodlands, scrubs, and long grasslands where there is a wide variety of prey to hunt. They are not found in the dense rainforests or too far into the desert. Many countries are now promoting new national parks to offer observing pride of lions within a safe habitat.\nWho do lions live with?\nLions are social animals who live in small groups called prides. A pride can be made up of 5-12 related females and their cubs, along with 2-3 adult male lions. The male lions patrol a territory marked with trees and rocks with urine to ward off intruders. The hunting in the wild is managed by the females together as the male lion is slower and easily spotted. Females together prey on wild animals and kill any prey even if it faster or bigger than them. Females also are responsible for taking care of the pride.\nHow long does a lion live?\nThe lion can live for 8-15 years in the wild. In captivity, lions can live up to the age of 25 years. Although, it depends on the type of lion habitat and if they are given proper care and nutrition.\nHow do they reproduce?\nMost lions reach their sexual maturity by 3-4 years. There is no specific mating season. The lionesses are polyestrous. A female lion may mate with more than one male during her heat cycle. The female gives birth to 1-4 cubs after an average gestation period of 110 days. The female will hunt alone during these times and closer to the den. Baby lions are born blind and are almost helpless at birth. They start walking around three weeks of age. The mother lion will join the pride only after the babies are six to eight weeks old. In a pride, lionesses often synchronize their reproductive cycle and indulge in communal rearing of the cubs. Weaning occurs at six or seven months.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe conservation status of the lion is vulnerable. The encroachment of their natural habitat for agriculture and cities is the most critical threat for these animals. The hunting of lions as a game was also a major reason for the decline in its population. In order to promote their conservation, hunting lions has been banned in Asia and Africa. Moreover, dedicated national parks are being created to offer the prides a safe habitat.\nLion Fun Facts\nWhat do lions look like?\nLions are famous for their courage and strength. The lion is portrayed as a symbol of strength in many places, be it in flags, emblems, or as an identification marker. They have the most powerful body in the cat family second only to the tiger. Their roar can be heard from five miles. Adult lions have yellow gold coats. Male lions are known for their mane, and the fringe of long hair that encircles their heads. The lion has a strong body with a round head. They have a coat colored from light buff, silver-grey yellowish red, and dark brown.\nHow cute are they?\nLions are ferocious-looking animals. We always associate them with strength and fear, but when observed in their natural habitat they can look cute and lazy. Especially little cubs and male lions with their manes. They do look majestic and regal as they are at the top of the food chain in the jungle.\nHow do they communicate?\nLions communicate in a lot of different ways. They make sounds like moans, grunts, roars, hums, purrs, snarls, woofs, and poofs. They are big non-verbal communicators, too. Male and female lions are known to purr, lick and gnaw at each other.\nHow big is a lion?\nLions are big cats. They are probably the biggest of the Panthera or the big cat species like tigers, lions, jaguars, and leopards. With a length of 4.5-8.2 ft, a lion is a big animal.\nHow fast can a lion run?\nThe lion can run at a speed of 50 mph in short bursts. Females may not run till they are very close to their prey.\nHow much does a lion weigh?\nThe Southern African female lion weighs 260-320 lb, and the male weighs 410-500 lb. The east African female lion weighs around 264 lb, and the male weighs around 385 lb. The Asiatic or the Indian female lion weighs 240-265 lb, and the male weighs around 352-420 lb.\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nMale lions are known as lions, and female lions are known as lionesses.\nWhat would you call a baby lion?\nBaby lions are called cubs. Every lion cub would spend some days with the mother as they don\u2019t do well on their own and need their mothers\u2019 assistance.\nWhat do they eat?\nLions are known as keystone predators, which means they have a huge impact on their environmental surroundings due to their wide prey spectrum. They prey on mammals, mostly ungulates like plains zebra, blue wildebeest, gemsbok, African buffalo, and giraffe. They prefer to hunt a species that weigh between 418-1200 lb. In India, they prey on sambar deer, chital and domestic cattle. A lion is capable of bringing down a wild beast or a zebra. Normally they hunt in their groups which are known as prides. A pride consists of usually 15-20 lions with 3 males, 12 related females, and the young lions.\nAre they dangerous?\nThey are dangerous if we ruffle them the wrong way. Lions are not known to hunt or attack a human until provoked or in dire circumstances.\nWould they make a good pet?\nInstead of keeping them as pets or in captivity, efforts are being made to restore their natural habitats, we have already seen a steady fall in their numbers. They have survived in captivity, but it wouldn't be a good idea to keep them as a pet.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nFemale lionesses lead the hunting and pride management.\nLions are known to jump or leap as far as 10 m.\nWhen a lion walks, its heels don't touch the ground, which makes it seem like they are tip-toeing.\nThe lion roar can be heard almost 5 miles away.\nLion diet comprises of 11-15 lb meat every day. But if they eat a large prey like a wildebeest, they can go without eating for five days.\nAdult lions are known to sleep for 20 hours a day, especially if they have had a heavy meal. They can sleep with one eye open.\nThe mane around the male lions\u2019 face is the only thing that differentiates them from female lions. The mane could be blonde, red, brown, or black in color and can cover its head, neck, and chest.\nWhen you compare a tiger vs lion in terms of strength, the tiger emerges as the stronger of the two. On comparing the two beasts based on their skulls, the lion skull is generally flatter and the face is upturned while the tiger skull has more of a rounded look.\nAlthough a mountain lion also belongs to the same species as an African lion, in terms of strength, the African lion wins easily over its distant cousin.\nWhat does a lion symbolize?\nThe lion is known as the king of the jungle. This species is known for their courage, power, and strength. They are huge beasts who have been used as symbols of courage and power for centuries now. This is the reason that most people love to get an artefact of a lion head.\nCan a lion have blue eyes?\nLion cubs are born with blue eyes.

In the wild, lions usually live no more than 8 to 10 years because of attacks by humans or other lions, or the effects of goring or kicks from intended prey. In captivity, they may live over 25 years. Where do lions live? Lions live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they lived across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are mainly found in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. What is a pride of lions? A pride is a group of lions that live together. The members of a pride spend days in several scattered groups that meet to hunt or share a meal. Each pride has its own territory that it defends, ranging from 20 square km (8 square miles) if food is abundant to 400 square km (around 150 square miles) if food is sparse. What is the purpose of a lion\u2019s mane? Manes make male lions look larger than they really are, which may function to intimidate rivals and impress prospective mates. Manes vary from one lion to another and may be entirely absent. What do lions eat? Lions usually hunt and eat medium-sized to large hoofed animals like wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes. They occasionally also prey on larger animals, especially sick or injured ones, and eat found meat such as carrion.\nSummary\nRead a brief summary of this topic\nlion, (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial \u201cking of beasts,\u201d the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions constitute a slightly smaller race that lives under strict protection in India\u2019s Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.\nGeneral characteristics The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes. The male\u2019s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look larger and may serve to intimidate rivals or impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 1.8\u20132.1 metres (6\u20137 feet) long, excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170\u2013230 kg (370\u2013500 pounds). The female, or lioness, is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9\u20131.1 metres, and a weight of 120\u2013180 kg. The lion\u2019s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat.

Curiosity may have killed the cat, but kinkajous, bluebacks, and mustelids are alive and well in these questions! They\u2019re just some of the amazing animals featured in this fact or fiction quiz.\nPrides Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride. The members of a pride typically spend the day in several scattered groups that may unite to hunt or share a meal. A pride consists of several generations of lionesses, some of which are related, a smaller number of breeding males, and their cubs. The group may consist of as few as 4 or as many as 37 members, but about 15 is the average size. Each pride has a well-defined territory consisting of a core area that is strictly defended against intruding lions and a fringe area where some overlap is tolerated. Where prey is abundant, a territory area may be as small as 20 square km (8 square miles), but if game is sparse, it may cover up to 400 square km. Some prides have been known to use the same territory for decades, passing the area on between females. Lions proclaim their territory by roaring and by scent marking. Their distinctive roar is generally delivered in the evening before a night\u2019s hunting and again before getting up at dawn. Males also proclaim their presence by urinating on bushes, trees, or simply on the ground, leaving a pungent scent behind. Defecation and rubbing against bushes leave different scent markings. Pride of lions (Panthera leo). \u00a9 Guido Amrein/Dreamstime.com There are a number of competing evolutionary explanations for why lions form groups. Large body size and high density of their main prey probably make group life more efficient for females in terms of energy expenditure. Groups of females, for example, hunt more effectively and are better able to defend cubs against infanticidal males and their hunting territory against other females. The relative importance of these factors is debated, and it is not clear which was responsible for the establishment of group life and which are secondary benefits."}

It is speculated that the growth of a mane is tied to testosterone because castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production.\nSome lionesses in northern Botswana have grown a mane and it is thought that they may carry a genetic disposition toward the phenomenon.

Most lion vocalizations are variations of growling, snarling, meowing, and roaring but also purring, puffing, bleating, and humming. Roaring is used to advertise its presence. Lions most often roar at night, and the sound of a roar can be heard from a distance of 5 miles or 8 km. They tend to roar in a very characteristic manner starting with a few deep, long roars that subside into a series of shorter ones.\nWhat makes lionesses better hunters than lions?\nLionesses are around 30% faster than male lions. This is because they are around a foot smaller in size and around 100-200 pounds lighter. They also vastly outnumber lions in a pride. Females will hunt together so they put their prey at a disadvantage.\nWhy do female lions hunt instead of males?\nLionesses hunt because that\u2019s the social structure of the pride. The male lion is the king and gets to lie around in the bushes for days on end. Lionesses are more agile and better built for hunting.\nThere\u2019s also more of them in pride and they hunt cooperatively.

They are not albinos; they lack the tawny coloration due to a rare condition that results in reduced pigmentation. Because of their majestic appearance, they have been revered as sacred beings by tribes in southern Africa, but have also been hunted to extinction in the wild. They are now being reintroduced in protected areas by the Global White Lion Protection Trust.\nFast Facts Scientific Name: Panthera leo\nPanthera leo Common Names: White lion\nWhite lion Order: Carnivora\nCarnivora Basic Animal Group: Mammalia\nMammalia Size: Up to 10 feet long and 4 feet high for males and up to 6 feet long and 3.6 feet for females\nUp to 10 feet long and 4 feet high for males and up to 6 feet long and 3.6 feet for females Weight: Up to 530 pounds for males and up to 400 pounds for females\nUp to 530 pounds for males and up to 400 pounds for females Life Span: 18 years\n18 years Diet: Small birds, reptiles, hoofed mammals\nSmall birds, reptiles, hoofed mammals Habitat: Savannah, woodland, desert\nSavannah, woodland, desert Population: 100s in captivity and 13 in the wild\n100s in captivity and 13 in the wild Conservation Status: Vulnerable\nVulnerable Fun Fact: White lions are symbols of leadership and pride to local communities in the Timbavati region.\nDescription\nWhite lions have a rare recessive trait that causes their white skin coloration. Unlike albino animals that lack pigmentation, white lions\u2019 rare gene produces lighter pigmentation. Whereas albinos have pink or red coloration to their eyes and noses, white lions have blue or gold eyes, black features on their noses, \u201ceye-liner,\u201d and dark patches behind their ears. Male white lions may have white, blonde, or pale hair in their manes and on the ends of their tails.\nThe white lion is a result of a genetic condition is known as leucism, a rarity where a recessive mutation in the gene causes the lion\u2019s coat to vary from near-white to blonde. Boy_Anupong / Getty Images\nHabitat and Distribution\nThe natural habitat of a white lion includes savannas, woodlands, and desert areas. They are indigenous to the Greater Timbavati region in southern Africa and are currently protected at the Central Kruger Park in South Africa. After being hunted to extinction in the wild, white lions were reintroduced in 2004. With the ban on trophy hunting in the Timbavati region and surrounding nature preserves, the first white cubs were born in the area in 2006. Kruger Park had its first occurrence of white lion cub births in 2014.\nDiet and Behavior\nWhite lions are carnivores, and they eat a variety of herbivorous animals. They hunt gazelles, zebras, buffaloes, wild hares, tortoises, and wildebeests. They have sharp teeth and claws that allow them to attack and kill their prey. They hunt by stalking their prey in packs, patiently waiting for the right time to strike. Lions typically kill their prey by strangulation and the pack consumes the carcass at the site of the kill.\nReproduction and Offspring\nThis is a two week old white lion cub. Tambako the Jaguar / Moment / Getty Images\nLike tawny lions, white lions reach sexual maturity between ages three and four. Most white lions are bred and born in captivity, usually in zoos. Those in captivity may mate on a yearly basis, while those in the wild mate about every two years. Lion cubs are born blind and rely on their mother for the first two years of life. A lioness usually gives birth to two to four cubs in a litter.\nIn order for there to be a chance that some of the offspring will be white lions, the parents either need to be white lions or carry the rare white lion gene. Since the animal must bear two recessive alleles to exhibit the trait, there are three scenarios in which a white lion cub might be born. If both parents are tawny and carry the gene, there is a 25% chance the offspring will be a white cub; if one parent is a white lion and the other is tawny with the gene, there is a 50% chance the offspring will be a white cub; and if both parents are white lions, there is a 100% chance the offspring will be a white cub.\nThreats\nThe biggest threat to white lions is uncontrolled trading and hunting of lions. Trophy hunting of dominant males of prides has reduced the gene pool, making white lion occurrences much more rare. Additionally, programs that wish to breed white lions for profit modify their genes.\nIn 2006, two cubs were born in the Umbabat Nature Reserve and two more were born in the Timbavati Reserve. None of the cubs, including the tawny ones, survived due to the killing of the dominant male lions of both prides for trophies. Since 2008, 11 white lion cubs have been spotted in and around the reserves of Timbavati and Umbabat.\nGenetics\nJohn McKeen / Moment / Getty Images\nWhite lions are leucistic, which means they have a rare gene that causes them to have less melanin and other pigments than non-leucistic animals. Melanin is a dark pigment found in skin, hair, fur, and eyes. In leucism, there is a total or partial lack of pigment producing cells known as melanocytes. The rare recessive gene responsible for leucism is a color inhibitor that causes the lion to lack darker pigmentation in some areas, but retain pigmentation in the eyes, nose, and ears.\nDue to their light skin, some have suggested that white lions are at a genetic disadvantage when compared to their tawny counterparts. Many people have argued that white lions are unable to camouflage themselves and hide from predators and marauding male lions in the wild. In 2012, PBS released a series called White Lions, which followed the survival of two female white lion cubs and the struggles they experienced. This series, as well as a 10-year scientific study on the topic, demonstrated just the opposite. In their natural habitat, white lions were able to camouflage themselves and were just as much of an apex predator as wild tawny lions.\nCultural and Social Significance\nIn countries like Kenya and Botswana, white lions are symbols of leadership, pride, and royalty, and are viewed as national assets. They are considered sacred to the local Sepedi and Tsonga communities of the Greater Timbavati region.\nConservation Status\nColin Langford / Getty Images\nSince white lions are included in the general classification for lions (Panthera leo), they are designated as vulnerable according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2015, the conservation authority in South Africa proposed to down-list the conservation status of all lions to Least Concern. Doing so would put white lions at serious risk of becoming extinct in the wild once again. The Global White Lion Protection Trust is currently pushing for the classification to be moved to Endangered.\nSources"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion", "text": "Large cat native to Africa and Asia\nThe lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.\nThe lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.\nOne of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.\nEtymology\nThe English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin le\u014dnem (nominative: le\u014d), which in turn was a borrowing from Ancient Greek \u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd l\u00e9\u014dn. The Hebrew word \u05dc\u05b8\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0 lavi may also be related. The generic name Panthera is traceable to the classical Latin word 'panth\u0113ra' and the ancient Greek word \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1 'panther'.\nTaxonomy\nthe lower one on the 2010 and 2011 studies. The upper cladogram is based on the 2006 study,the lower one on the 2010and 2011studies.\nFelis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema Naturae. The genus name Panthera was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816. Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005. They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins.\nSubspecies\nRange map showing distribution of subspecies and clades\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, with about a dozen recognised as valid taxa until 2017. Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used only two subspecific names: P. l. leo for African lion populations, and P. l. persica for the Asiatic lion population. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised lion taxonomy, and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic studies on lion evolution, namely:\nHowever, there seems to be some degree of overlap between both groups in northern Central Africa. DNA analysis from a more recent study indicates, that Central African lions are derived from both northern and southern lions, as they cluster with P. leo leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies whereas their genomic DNA indicates a closer relationship with P. leo melanochaita.\nLion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian Highlands cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad, while lions from other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa. Researchers therefore assume Ethiopia is a contact zone between the two subspecies. Genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that it clustered with P. l. leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to P. l. melanochaita. This result suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in Central Africa may require revision.\nFossil records\nOther lion subspecies or sister species to the modern lion existed in prehistoric times:\nEvolution\nPanthera spelaea\nblue Panthera atrox\ngreen Panthera leo\nMaximal range of the modern lion\nand its prehistoric relatives\nin the late Pleistocene redbluegreenMaximal range of the modern lionand its prehistoric relativesin the late Pleistocene\nThe Panthera lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around to , and the geographic origin of the genus is most likely northern Central Asia. Results of analyses differ in the phylogenetic relationship of the lion; it was thought to form a sister group with the jaguar (P. onca) that diverged , but also with the leopard (P. pardus) that diverged  to . Hybridisation between lion and snow leopard (P. uncia) ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years ago. The lion-leopard clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene. The earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million years old.\nEstimates for the divergence time of the modern and cave lion lineages range from 529,000 to 392,000 years ago based on mutation rate per generation time of the modern lion. There is no evidence for gene flow between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area. The Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial period without mitochondrial descendants on other continents. The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the Middle Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late Pleistocene. Lion populations in East and Southern Africa became separated from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial rainforest expanded 183,500 to 81,800 years ago. They shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago. Due to the expansion of the Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion populations in West and North Africa became separated. As the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more open habitats, lions moved from West to Central Africa. Lions from North Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago.\nExtinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and Africa. Genetic evidence revealed numerous mutations in lion samples from East and Southern Africa, which indicates that this group has a longer evolutionary history than genetically less diverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa. A whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples showed that samples from West Africa shared alleles with samples from Southern Africa, and samples from Central Africa shared alleles with samples from Asia. This phenomenon indicates that Central Africa was a melting pot of lion populations after they had become isolated, possibly migrating through corridors in the Nile Basin during the early Holocene.\nHybrids\nIn zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose. The liger is bigger than a lion and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects. The leopon is a hybrid between a lion and leopard.\nDescription\nA tuft at the end of the tail is a distinct characteristic of the lion. Skeleton\nThe lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual dimorphism. Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.\nThe tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that in some lions conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard \"spine\" or \"spur\" that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail bone. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth and develops at around 5+1\u20442 months of age. It is readily identifiable by the age of seven months.\nOf the living felid species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight, and height at the shoulder. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.\nSkeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represents the highest percentage of muscles among mammals.\nSize\nThe size and weight of adult lions varies across global range and habitats. Accounts of a few individuals that were larger than average exist from Africa and India.\nAverage Female lions Male lions Head-and-body length 160\u2013184 cm (63\u201372 in) 184\u2013208 cm (72\u201382 in) Tail length 72\u201389.5 cm (28.3\u201335.2 in) 82.5\u201393.5 cm (32.5\u201336.8 in) Weight 118.37\u2013143.52 kg (261.0\u2013316.4 lb) in Southern Africa,\n119.5 kg (263 lb) in East Africa,\n110\u2013120 kg (240\u2013260 lb) in India 186.55\u2013225 kg (411.3\u2013496.0 lb) in Southern Africa,\n174.9 kg (386 lb) in East Africa,\n160\u2013190 kg (350\u2013420 lb) in India\nMane\nThe male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species. It may have evolved around 320,000\u2013190,000 years ago. It starts growing when lions are about a year old. Mane colour varies and darkens with age; research shows its colour and size are influenced by environmental factors such as average ambient temperature. Mane length apparently signals fighting success in male\u2013male relationships; darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year. The presence, absence, colour and size of the mane are associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate and testosterone production; the rule of thumb is that a darker, fuller mane indicates a healthier animal. In Serengeti National Park, female lions favour males with dense, dark manes as mates. Cool ambient temperature in European and North American zoos may result in a heavier mane. Asiatic lions usually have sparser manes than average African lions.\nAlmost all male lions in Pendjari National Park are either maneless or have very short manes. Maneless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in Sudan's Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. The original male white lion from Timbavati in South Africa was also maneless. The hormone testosterone has been linked to mane growth; castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. Increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.\nColour variation\nThe white lion is a rare morph with a genetic condition called leucism which is caused by a double recessive allele. It is not albino; it has normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lions have occasionally been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa. They were removed from the wild in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion gene pool. Nevertheless, 17 births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015. White lions are selected for breeding in captivity. They have reportedly been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.\nDistribution and habitat\nAfrican lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa. The lion prefers grassy plains and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers and open woodlands with bushes. It rarely enters closed forests. On Mount Elgon, the lion has been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to the snow line on Mount Kenya. Savannahs with an annual rainfall of 300 to 1,500 mm (12 to 59 in) make up the majority of lion habitat in Africa, estimated at 3,390,821 km2 (1,309,203 sq mi) at most; but remnant populations are also present in tropical moist forests in West Africa and montane forests in East Africa. The Asiatic lion now survives only in and around Gir National Park in Gujarat, western India. Its habitat is a mixture of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous scrub forest.\nHistorical range\nIn Africa, the range of the lion originally spanned most of the central African rainforest zone and the Sahara desert. In the 1960s, it became extinct in North Africa, except in the southern part of Sudan.\nIn southern Europe and Asia, the lion once ranged in regions where climatic conditions supported an abundance of prey. In Greece, it was common as reported by Herodotus in 480 BC; it was considered rare by 300 BC and extirpated by AD 100. It was present in the Caucasus until the 10th century. It lived in Palestine until the Middle Ages, and in Southwest Asia until the late 19th century. By the late 19th century, it had been extirpated in most of Turkey. The last live lion in Iran was sighted in 1942 about 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Dezful, although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the Karun river in Kh\u016bzest\u0101n Province in 1944. It once ranged from Sind and Punjab in Pakistan to Bengal and the Narmada River in central India.\nBehaviour and ecology\nLions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and fifty minutes eating.\nGroup organisation\nLion pride in Etosha National Park A lioness (left) and two males in Masai Mara\nThe lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of related individuals with their offspring. Such a group is called a \"pride\". Groups of male lions are called \"coalitions\". Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership changes only with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females leave and become nomadic. The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. Large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride that always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around two or three years of age.\nSome lions are \"nomads\" that range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or alone. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. A lion may switch lifestyles; nomads can become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrus allow nomadic males to approach them. Males spend years in a nomadic phase before gaining residence in a pride. A study undertaken in the Serengeti National Park revealed that nomadic coalitions gain residency at between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age. In Kruger National Park, dispersing male lions move more than 25 km (16 mi) away from their natal pride in search of their own territory. Female lions stay closer to their natal pride. Therefore, female lions in an area are more closely related to each other than male lions in the same area.\nThe area occupied by a pride is called a \"pride area\" whereas that occupied by a nomad is a \"range\". Males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their territory. The reasons for the development of sociality in lionesses\u2014the most pronounced in any cat species\u2014are the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears to be an obvious reason, but this is uncertain upon examination; coordinated hunting allows for more successful predation but also ensures non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake. Some females, however, take a role raising cubs that may be left alone for extended periods. Members of the pride tend to regularly play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride; hunters are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection; sharing food within the family; protecting the young, maintaining territory and individual insurance against injury and hunger.\nBoth males and females defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride; slower-moving individuals may provide other valuable services to the group. Alternatively, there may be rewards associated with being a leader that fends off intruders; the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship with the pride from outside males who may attempt to usurp them.\nAsiatic lion prides differ in group composition. Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to three males, forming a loose pride while females associate with up to 12 other females, forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. Female and male lions associate only when mating. Coalitions of males hold territory for a longer time than single lions. Males in coalitions of three or four individuals exhibit a pronounced hierarchy, in which one male dominates the others and mates more frequently.\nHunting and diet\nThe lion is a generalist hypercarnivore and is considered to be both an apex and keystone predator due to its wide prey spectrum. Its prey consists mainly of mammals, particularly ungulates weighing 190\u2013550 kg (420\u20131,210 lb) with a preference for blue wildebeest, plains zebra, African buffalo, gemsbok and giraffe. Lions also hunt common warthog depending on availability, although the species is below the preferred weight range. In India, sambar deer and chital are the most commonly recorded wild prey, while domestic livestock may contribute significantly to their diet. They usually avoid fully grown adult elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamus and small prey like dik-dik, hyrax, hare and monkey. Unusual prey include porcupines and small reptiles. Lions kill other predators such as leopard, cheetah and spotted hyena but seldom consume them.\nYoung lions first display stalking behaviour at around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old and begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two. Single lions are capable of bringing down zebra and wildebeest, while larger prey like buffalo and giraffe are riskier. In Chobe National Park, large prides have been observed hunting African bush elephants up to around 15 years old in exceptional cases, with the victims being calves, juveniles, and even subadults. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favoured position in the group, either stalking prey on the \"wing\", then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey fleeing from other lionesses. Males attached to prides do not usually participate in group hunting. Some evidence suggests, however, that males are just as successful as females; they are typically solo hunters who ambush prey in small bushland.\nLions are not particularly known for their stamina; for instance, a lioness' heart comprises only 0.57% of her body weight and a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight, whereas a hyena's heart comprises almost 1% of its body weight. Thus, lions run quickly only in short bursts at about 48\u201359 km/h (30\u201337 mph) and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. One study in 2018 recorded a lion running at a top speed of 74.1 km/h (46.0 mph). They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night. The lion's attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch prey with a fast rush and final leap. They usually pull it down by the rump and kill by a strangling bite to the throat. They also kill prey by enclosing its muzzle in their jaws. Male lions usually aim for the backs or hindquarters of rivals, rather than their necks.\nLions typically consume prey at the location of the hunt but sometimes drag large prey into cover. They tend to squabble over kills, particularly the males. Cubs suffer most when food is scarce but otherwise all pride members eat their fill, including old and crippled lions, which can live on leftovers. Large kills are shared more widely among pride members. An adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg (11 lb) of meat per day while males require about 7 kg (15 lb). Lions gorge themselves and eat up to 30 kg (66 lb) in one session; if it is unable to consume all of the kill, it rests for a few hours before continuing to eat. On hot days, the pride retreats to shade with one or two males standing guard. Lions defend their kills from scavengers such as vultures and hyenas.\nLions scavenge on carrion when the opportunity arises; they scavenge animals dead from natural causes such as disease or those that were killed by other predators. Scavenging lions keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, which indicate the death or distress of an animal. Most carrion on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by hyenas rather than lions. Carrion is thought to provide a large part of lion diet.\nPredator competition\nLion attacked by spotted hyenas in Sabi Sand Game Reserve Lioness stealing a kill from a leopard in Kruger National Park\nLions and spotted hyenas occupy a similar ecological niche and where they coexist they compete for prey and carrion; a review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas unless the lions are on a kill or are being harassed by the hyenas, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions, with or without the presence of food. Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro crater it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate. In Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed; hyenas frequently challenge lions and steal their kills, obtaining food from 63% of all lion kills. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30\u2013100 m (100\u2013330 ft) until the lions have finished.\nHyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions and to force the lions off a kill. The two species attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason. Lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha National Park. Spotted hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their territories. When the lion population in Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve declined, the spotted hyena population increased rapidly. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas show that specimens without prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to lion scent.\nLions tend to dominate cheetahs and leopards, steal their kills and kill their cubs and even adults when given the chance. Cheetahs in particular often lose their kills to lions or other predators. A study in the Serengeti ecosystem revealed that lions killed at least 17 of 125 cheetah cubs born between 1987 and 1990. Cheetahs avoid their competitors by using different temporal and habitat niches. Leopards are able to take refuge in trees; lionesses, however, occasionally attempt to climb up and retrieve leopard kills from that height.\nLions similarly dominate African wild dogs, taking their kills and preying on young and rarely adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. However, there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs. Lions also charge at Nile crocodiles; depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion, either animal can lose their kills to the other. Lions have been observed killing crocodiles that ventured onto land. Crocodiles may also kill and eat lions, evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.\nReproduction and life cycle\nLions mating at Masai Mara A lion cub in Masai Mara\nMost lionesses reproduce by the time they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at a specific time of year and the females are polyestrous. Like those of other cats, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat. Generation length of the lion is about seven years. The average gestation period is around 110 days; the female gives birth to a litter of between one and four cubs in a secluded den, which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area, usually away from the pride. She will often hunt alone while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the den. Lion cubs are born blind; their eyes open around seven days after birth. They weigh 1.2\u20132.1 kg (2.6\u20134.6 lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age. To avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-one by the nape of the neck.\nUsually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old. Sometimes the introduction to pride life occurs earlier, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies\u2014one male could patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, while another may snarl and bat the cubs away.\nVideo of a lioness and her cubs in Phinda Reserve\nPride lionesses often synchronise their reproductive cycles and communal rearing and suckling of the young, which suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronisation of births is advantageous because the cubs grow to being roughly the same size and have an equal chance of survival, and sucklings are not dominated by older cubs. Weaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.\nWhen one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male. Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Up to 80% of lion cubs will die before the age of two. Both male and female lions may be ousted from prides to become nomads, although most females usually remain with their birth pride. When a pride becomes too large, however, the youngest generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to find their own territory. When a new male lion takes over a pride, adolescents both male and female may be evicted. Lions of both sexes may be involved in group homosexual and courtship activities; males will also head-rub and roll around with each other before simulating sex together.\nHealth\nAlthough adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests most die violently from attacks by humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on members of other prides they encounter in territorial disputes or members of the home pride when fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and cubs may fall victim to hyenas and leopards or be trampled by buffalo or elephants. Careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.\nTicks commonly infest the ears, neck and groin regions of lions. Adult forms of several tapeworm species of the genus Taenia have been isolated from lion intestines, having been ingested as larvae in antelope meat. Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) in 1962; this resulted in lions becoming emaciated and covered in bloody, bare patches. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many died or migrated and the local population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals. A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions.\nCaptive lions have been infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) since at least the mid 1970s. CDV is spread by domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis. Feline immunodeficiency virus and lentivirus also affect captive lions.\nCommunication\nHead rubbing among pride members is a common social behaviour\nWhen resting, lion socialisation occurs through a number of behaviours; the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful, tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking, which have been compared with the role of allogrooming among primates. Head rubbing\u2014nuzzling the forehead, face and neck against another lion\u2014appears to be a form of greeting and is seen often after an animal has been apart from others or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked; this behaviour may have arisen out of utility because lions cannot lick these areas themselves.\nLion roar ( 0 : 09 ) A captive lion roaring Problems playing this file? See media help.\nLions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures. A common facial expression is the \"grimace face\" or flehmen response, which a lion makes when sniffing chemical signals and involves an open mouth with bared teeth, raised muzzle, wrinkled nose closed eyes and relaxed ears. Lions also use chemical and visual marking; males will spray and scrape plots of ground and objects within the territory.\nThe lion's repertoire of vocalisations is large; variations in intensity and pitch appear to be central to communication. Most lion vocalisations are variations of growling, snarling, meowing and roaring. Other sounds produced include purring, puffing, bleating and humming. Roaring is used to advertise its presence. Lions most often roar at night, a sound that can be heard from a distance of 8 kilometres (5 mi). They tend to roar in a very characteristic manner starting with a few deep, long roars that subside into a series of shorter ones.\nConservation\nThe lion is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Indian population is listed on CITES Appendix I and the African population on CITES Appendix II.\nIn Africa\nVideo of a wild lioness\nSeveral large and well-managed protected areas in Africa host large lion populations. Where an infrastructure for wildlife tourism has been developed, cash revenue for park management and local communities is a strong incentive for lion conservation. Most lions now live in East and Southern Africa; their numbers are rapidly decreasing, and fell by an estimated 30\u201350% in the late half of the 20th century. Primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference. In 1975, it was estimated that since the 1950s, lion numbers had decreased by half to 200,000 or fewer. Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002\u20132004.\nIn the Republic of the Congo, Odzala-Kokoua National Park was considered a lion stronghold in the 1990s. By 2014, no lions were recorded in the protected area so the population is considered locally extinct. The West African lion population is isolated from the one in Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. In 2015, it was estimated that this population consists of about 400 animals, including fewer than 250 mature individuals. They persist in three protected areas in the region, mostly in one population in the W A P protected area complex, shared by Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. This population is listed as Critically Endangered. Field surveys in the WAP ecosystem revealed that lion occupancy is lowest in the W National Park, and higher in areas with permanent staff and thus better protection.\nA population occurs in Cameroon's Waza National Park, where between approximately 14 and 21 animals persisted as of 2009. In addition, 50 to 150 lions are estimated to be present in Burkina Faso's Arly-Singou ecosystem. In 2015, an adult male lion and a female lion were sighted in Ghana's Mole National Park. These were the first sightings of lions in the country in 39 years. In the same year, a population of up to 200 lions that was previously thought to have been extirpated was filmed in the Alatash National Park, Ethiopia, close to the Sudanese border.\nIn 2005, Lion Conservation Strategies were developed for West and Central Africa, and or East and Southern Africa. The strategies seek to maintain suitable habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base for lions, reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations, and make lion\u2013human coexistence sustainable. Lion depredation on livestock is significantly reduced in areas where herders keep livestock in improved enclosures. Such measures contribute to mitigating human\u2013lion conflict.\nIn Asia\nA lioness in Gir National Park\nThe last refuge of the Asiatic lion population is the 1,412 km2 (545 sq mi) Gir National Park and surrounding areas in the region of Saurashtra or Kathiawar Peninsula in Gujarat State, India. The population has risen from approximately 180 lions in 1974 to about 400 in 2010. It is geographically isolated, which can lead to inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity. Since 2008, the Asiatic lion has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. By 2015, the population had grown to 523 individuals inhabiting an area of 7,000 km2 (2,700 sq mi) in Saurashtra. The Asiatic Lion Census conducted in 2017 recorded about 650 individuals.\nThe presence of numerous human habitations close to the National Park results in conflict between lions, local people and their livestock. Some consider the presence of lions a benefit, as they keep populations of crop damaging herbivores in check. The establishment of a second, independent Asiatic lion population in Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, located in Madhya Pradesh was planned but in 2017, the Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project seemed unlikely to be implemented.\nCaptive breeding\nLions imported to Europe before the middle of the 19th century were possibly foremost Barbary lions from North Africa, or Cape lions from Southern Africa. Another 11 animals thought to be Barbary lions kept in Addis Ababa Zoo are descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink International in collaboration with Oxford University launched an ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. However, a genetic analysis showed that the captive lions at Addis Ababa Zoo were not Barbary lions, but rather closely related to wild lions in Chad and Cameroon.\nIn 1982, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums started a Species Survival Plan for the Asiatic lion to increase its chances of survival. In 1987, it was found that most lions in North American zoos were hybrids between African and Asiatic lions. Breeding programs need to note origins of the participating animals to avoid cross-breeding different subspecies and thus reducing their conservation value. Captive breeding of lions was halted to eliminate individuals of unknown origin and pedigree. Wild-born lions were imported to American zoos from Africa between 1989 and 1995. Breeding was continued in 1998 in the frame of an African lion Species Survival Plan.\nAbout 77% of the captive lions registered in the International Species Information System in 2006 were of unknown origin; these animals might have carried genes that are extinct in the wild and may therefore be important to the maintenance of the overall genetic variability of the lion.\nInteractions with humans\nIn zoos and circuses\nLion at Melbourne Zoo 19th-century etching of a lion tamer in a cage with lions and tigers\nLions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century. Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits, there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. Lions can live over twenty years in captivity; a lion in Honolulu Zoo died at the age of 22 in August 2007. His two sisters, born in 1986, also reached the age of 22.\nThe first European \"zoos\" spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century, and until the 17th century were called seraglios; at that time they came to be called menageries, an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. They spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance to the rest of Europe. In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, lions were kept at the Tower of London in a seraglio established by King John in the 13th century; this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by Henry I at his hunting lodge in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where according to William of Malmesbury lions had been stocked.\nLions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s. Further changes took place in the early 20th century when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures with concrete \"rocks\", more open space and a moat instead of bars, more closely resembling a natural habitat. Hagenbeck designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo; although his designs were popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the 1960s. In the late 20th century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals; some attractions such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park placed the den on ground level, higher than visitors.\nLion taming has been part of both established circuses and individual acts such as Siegfried & Roy. The practice began in the early 19th century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh, who both toured widely and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore (\"the lions of Mysore\"), an idea Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows and entered public consciousness in the early 20th century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries. The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by the placing of the tamer's head in the lion's mouth. The now-iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903\u20131965).\nHunting and games\nLion hunting has occurred since ancient times and was often a royal pastime; intended to demonstrate the power of the king over nature. The earliest surviving record of lion hunting is an ancient Egyptian inscription dated circa 1380 BC that mentions Pharaoh Amenhotep III killing 102 lions \"with his own arrows\" during the first ten years of his rule. The Assyrians would release captive lions in a reserved space for the king to hunt; this event would be watched by spectators as the king and his men, on horseback or chariots, killed the lions with arrows and spears. Lions were also hunted during the Mughal Empire, where Emperor Jahangir is said to have excelled at it. In Ancient Rome, lions were kept by emperors for hunts, gladiator fights and executions.\nThe Maasai people have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of passage. Historically, lions were hunted by individuals, however, due to reduced lion populations, elders discourage solo lion hunts. During the European colonisation of Africa in the 19th century, the hunting of lions was encouraged because they were considered as vermin and lion hides fetched \u00a31 each. The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century. Trophy hunting of lions in recent years has been met with controversy; notably with the killing of Cecil the lion in mid-2015.\nMan-eating\nLions do not usually hunt humans but some (usually males) seem to seek them out. One well-publicised case is the Tsavo maneaters; in 1898, 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge in Kenya. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour; they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans. Sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but the behaviour is not unusual, nor necessarily aberrant.\nLions' proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period. The incidents occurred near Selous National Park in Rufiji District and in Lindi Province near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villages into bush country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi in which lions seize humans from the centres of substantial villages have been documented. Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon, when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.\nAccording to Robert R. Frump, Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and eaten by lions; park officials have said man-eating is a problem there. Frump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly crossed the park in daytime with little harm.\nCultural significance\nThe lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. It appeared as a symbol for strength and nobility in cultures across Europe, Asia and Africa, despite incidents of attacks on people. The lion has been depicted as \"king of the jungle\" and \"king of beasts\", and thus became a popular symbol for royalty and stateliness. The lion is also used as a symbol of sporting teams.\nAfrica\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, the lion has been a common character in stories, proverbs and dances, but rarely featured in visual arts. In some cultures, the lion symbolises power and royalty. In the Swahili language, the lion is known as simba which also means \"aggressive\", \"king\" and \"strong\". Some rulers had the word \"lion\" in their nickname. Sundiata Keita of the Mali Empire was called \"Lion of Mali\". The founder of the Waalo kingdom is said to have been raised by lions and returned to his people part-lion to unite them using the knowledge he learned from the lions.\nIn parts of West Africa, lions symbolised the top class of their social hierarchies. In more heavily forested areas where lions were rare, the leopard represented the top of the hierarchy. In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated with healing and provides the connection between seers and the supernatural. In other East African traditions, the lion represents laziness. In much of African folklore, the lion is portrayed as having low intelligence and is easily tricked by other animals.\nThe ancient Egyptians portrayed several of their war deities as lionesses, which they revered as fierce hunters. Egyptian deities associated with lions include Sekhmet, Bast, Mafdet, Menhit, Pakhet and Tefnut. These deities were often connected with the sun god Ra and his fierce heat, and their dangerous power was invoked to guard people or sacred places. The sphinx, a figure with a lion's body and the head of a human or other creature, represented a pharaoh or deity who had taken on this protective role.\nEastern world\nThe lion was a prominent symbol in ancient Mesopotamia from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian times, where it was strongly associated with kingship. Lions were among the major symbols of the goddess Inanna/Ishtar. The Lion of Babylon was the foremost symbol of the Babylonian Empire. The Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal is a famous sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs from c. 640 BC, now in the British Museum. The Lion of Judah is the biblical emblem of the tribe of Judah and the later Kingdom of Judah. Lions are frequently mentioned in the Bible; notably in the Book of Daniel in which the eponymous hero refuses to worship King Darius and is forced to sleep in the lions' den where he is miraculously unharmed (Dan 6). In the Book of Judges, Samson kills a lion as he travels to visit a Philistine woman.(Judg 14).\nIndo-Persian chroniclers regarded the lion as keeper of order in the realm of animals. The Sanskrit word mrigendra signifies a lion as king of animals in general or deer in particular. Narasimha, the man-lion, is one of ten avatars of the Hindu god Vishnu. Singh is an ancient Indian vedic name meaning \"lion\", dating back over 2,000 years. It was originally used only by Rajputs, a Hindu Kshatriya or military caste but is used by millions of Hindu Rajputs and more than twenty million Sikhs today. The Lion Capital of Ashoka, erected by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century CE, depicts four lions standing back to back. It was made the National Emblem of India in 1950. The lion is also symbolic for the Sinhalese people; the term derived from the Sanskrit Sinhala, meaning \"of lions\" while a sword-wielding lion is the central figure on the national flag of Sri Lanka.\nThe lion is a common motif in Chinese art; it was first used in art during the late Spring and Autumn period (fifth or sixth century BC) and became more popular during the Han Dynasty (206 BC \u2013 AD 220) when imperial guardian lions started to be placed in front of imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of Buddhist art to China in the Tang Dynasty after the sixth century AD, lions were usually depicted wingless with shorter, thicker bodies and curly manes. The lion dance is a traditional dance in Chinese culture in which performers in lion costumes mimic a lion's movements, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums and gongs. They are performed at Chinese New Year, the August Moon Festival and other celebratory occasions for good luck.\nWestern world\nLion-headed figures and amulets were excavated in tombs in the Greek islands of Crete, Euboea, Rhodes, Paros and Chios. They are associated with the Egyptian deity Sekhmet and date to the early Iron Age between the 9th and 6th centuries BC. The lion is featured in several of Aesop's fables, notably The Lion and the Mouse. The Nemean lion was symbolic in ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign Leo, and described in mythology, where it was killed and worn by the hero Heracles, symbolising victory over death. Lancelot and Gawain were also heroes slaying lions in the Middle Ages. In some medieval stories, lions were portrayed as allies and companions. \"Lion\" was the nickname of several medieval warrior-rulers with a reputation for bravery, such as Richard the Lionheart.\nLions continue to appear in modern literature as characters including the messianic Aslan in the 1950 novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Chronicles of Narnia series by C. S. Lewis, and the comedic Cowardly Lion in L. Frank Baum's 1900 The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Lion symbolism was used from the advent of cinema; one of the most iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios since the 1920s. The 1966 film Born Free features Elsa the lioness and is based on the 1960 non-fiction book with the same title. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King.\nLions are frequently depicted on coats of arms, like on the coat of arms of Finland, either as a device on shields or as supporters, but the lioness is used much less frequently. The heraldic lion is particularly common in British arms. It is traditionally depicted in a great variety of attitudes, although within French heraldry only lions rampant are considered to be lions; feline figures in any other position are instead referred to as leopards.\nSee also\nReferences\nBooks\nNotes"}

Lions could be established throughout the Middle East, Greece and also in Northern India.\nPresently, only a minute population of lions reside in India. Majority of lions can be located in Africa, but their quantity is becoming less due to of the loss of habitation.\nHow do they live?\nLions reside in batch that are known as prides. There are about 10-20 lions in a pride. Each pride has a home region that is marked as its territory. Lions do not permit unknown animals to kill in their territory. The area can be as vast as 100 square miles.\nWhat is life span of lion?\nLions can develop to 48 inches in length and scale between 300 to 500 pounds. Lions survive the expanded life in captivity. They can touch up to 25 years of age when looked after in zoos. In the woods, their existence is very much difficult and many lions hardly touch the age of 10.\nWhat do they eat?\nLions are meat eater, which means that they survive on meat. Mice, lizards, tortoises, warthogs, antelopes and even crocodiles are included part of a lion\u2019s meal. Because they frequently lap over kills made by cheetahs and leopards, forage food provides more than 50 percent of their food in region like the Serengeti plains.\nThe females do the killing, but the males will aid if the females are having hard time hunting a huge animal. However, the male, if the first to consume. When the male is completed, the females and the cubs may feed.\nWhat is reproduction cycle of lion?\nLioness is a feminine lion. They are all set to have young ones when they are 2-3 years old. Offspring include two or three cubs that scale about 3 pounds each. Some mothers gingerly raise the young.\nGenerally, two or more females in a pride give childbirth about the same time, and the cubs are nature altogether. A lioness will allow cubs other than her own to breastfeed."}

The scientific term for this family is \u2018felidae\u2018.\nA member of the felidae family is called a felid.\nThe term \u2018big cats\u2018 is often used to separate larger members of the felidae family, such as lions, tigers and jaguars. from the smaller members.\nLions are the second largest felids, being slightly smaller than tigers.\nAn adult male lion may weigh around 225kg, and measure more than 3 metres from nose to tail.\nThe lion\u2019s golden colour provides camouflage when it is hunting. A thick band of darker hair grows around a male lion\u2019s neck and shoulders. This is known as a mane. Lions\u2019 manes can vary in colour and size; some male lions appear not to have manes at all.\nFemale lions, known as lionesses, are smaller than the males, and do not have manes.\nLions are at the top of the food chain. This means that an adult lion has no natural predators.\nLions are mainly nocturnal (active during the night). Lions hunt at night because it\u2019s often too hot during the day.\nLions spend the day sleeping and resting in the shade.\nWhere Do Lions Live?\nLions are found in the wild in southern and eastern Africa. A very small colony also lives in the Gir Forest National Park in western India.\nLions used to be much more widespread. 2,000 years ago they were even found in Europe. However, thanks mainly to the spread of man, there are far fewer lions in the wild nowadays.\nA Pride Of Lions\nUnlike other felines, the lion is a social animal and often lives in groups known as prides. There can be as many as 30 lions in a pride, but most prides are smaller.\nA typical pride consists of one adult male lion, several lionesses and younger lions of both sexes.\nMale lions will often fight other males for their place in a pride. Larger prides can have two or even three males.\nSome lions live and hunt alone.\nLionesses give birth to 2-3 cubs. When the young are born they are blind, and have spotted coats.\nWhat Do Lions Eat?\nLions mostly eat grazing herd animals such as antelopes, zebras, gazelles and wildebeests.\nHow Do Lions Hunt?\nLions usually hunt at night, either alone or in packs.\nA pack of lions can use a number of strategies to catch their prey. Sometimes the pack appears to split up, with some members pursuing prey animals into an ambush set by the others.\nAs we\u2019ve found, lions can run very fast. However, they can\u2019t run at full speed for very long, and are often not as fast as their prey.\nThis means that lions either have to sneak up on their prey, or lie in wait for it to get close enough to catch. Lions will wait for hours on end to catch their prey.\nLions can reach their top speed very quickly, and in a quick dash can often get to the prey before it has a chance to flee.\nLions are very strong; a swipe of their paw can be enough to bring down a smaller animal. Lions often kill by strangulation, clamping their powerful jaws around the neck of their prey.\nA male lion has enough strength to drag a large animal in its jaws.\nAre Lions Endangered?\nLions are not officially an endangered species. However, their numbers are declining and they are considered to be a vulnerable species.\nIt is thought that there are only between 20,000 \u2013 40,000 lions in Africa. This may sound a lot, but considering there are over 7 billion people, it is really a tiny figure.\nLions face two main problems. The first is that they are hunted by humans who are protecting their own farm animals. The other problem is that the animals that lions eat in the wild are themselves in decline.\n10 Amazing Facts About Lions\nLions like to drink water after they eat. Lions sometimes spend 20 minutes drinking! Older lions can start to lose their manes. A lion can see 5 to 6 times better than a human. A lion can hear prey more than a mile away. Lions are carnivores. This means they eat meat. Some of their food includes buffalo, zebra, antelope, giraffes, elephants and wildebeest. Lions are the second biggest member of the cat family (the biggest feline is the tiger). Lions are social animals but once a pride is formed, outsiders are not welcome. Lions spend much of the day sleeping or resting. Some spend between 16 \u2013 20 hours every day at rest. Lions are ready to start hunting at 2 years of age. Lions are fearsome hunters, but will also scavenge for food.\nLion activities\nNow that you know a lot about Lions, try these activities:"}

These big cats really do seem like royalty. They are powerful, graceful, and have a roar that can be heard from up to 5 miles (8 kilometers) away! There are lots of cool facts about lions, some of them you may already know, but keep reading to find out more!\nQuick Facts About Lions\nLions are the only known type of cat that live in groups, which are called prides. A pride has many females, their cubs and just a few males.\nThe females do most of the hunting. They work together to bring down prey. This keeps them safer than if they hunted alone.\nMales have an important job too. They patrol their territory and protect the young cubs. They also make sure cubs get enough food.\nMale lions have manes. It has been thought that maybe manes protect them during fights with other lions. The color and size of a lion\u2019s mane can also be important clues about how healthy that lion might be.\nLions are carnivorous, meaning they survive by eating other animals. They eat almost anything including antelope , buffalo, giraffes , crocodiles , baby elephants , lizards and bugs. They have also been known to sometimes steal food from other big cats.\n, buffalo, , , baby , lizards and bugs. They have also been known to sometimes steal food from other big cats. Lions spend a lot of time napping \u2013 males will sleep up to 20 hours each day while females sleep up to 18!\nThe lion is a muscular, deep-chested large cat with a rounded head, a reduced neck, round ears and fur that differs in color from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown.\nA lion\u2019s mane is one of its most recognizable features, but only male lions grow manes. When male lions reach a year old, their mane starts growing. The color of the mane varies and darkens with age.\nSome research shows that its size and color are influenced by environmental factors, such as average ambient temperature, and the presence of parasites such as ticks and fleas.\nLions are the second largest of all the big cats in the world, right after tigers . Most males weigh around 400 pounds (180 kilograms), while females weigh around 290 pounds (130 kilograms). The biggest lion ever recorded weighed over 800 pounds!\nThe average 8-year-old human weighs about 55 pounds, so it would take about 7 eight-year-olds to weigh the same as 1 male lion or 5 eight-year-olds to equal a female lion. That\u2019s pretty heavy!\nLions are carnivores, which means they eat meat and hunt other animals for food. Males need to eat about 15.4 pounds of meat each day, which is much more than the 11 pounds of meat a female lion needs each day.\nLions generally hunt from dusk until dawn and spend the day resting. In nature, lions live in southern and eastern regions of Africa where it tends to be very hot during the day.\nLions will preserve their energy and try to stay cool during the hot days and they generally hunt while the sun is down and temperatures are cooler.\nMost lions nowadays live in special reserves in Africa . These are places set aside for them where they cannot be hunted or hurt. It is estimated that about 20,000 lions live in Africa, while there are less than 300 Asian lions in the Gir forest of India and another 200 live in zoos around the world. Lions are an endangered species.\nJust 100 years ago, there were more than 200,000 lions in Africa, but many have been killed by hunters, poachers, and ranchers. Lions live up to 16 years in the wild, but the oldest lion ever recorded lived to be 29 years old.\nLions are pretty unique compared to other large cat species like tigers, leopards, and cheetahs. First, lions live in groups called prides. Most other cats are solitary animals, meaning they prefer to live and hunt alone.\nA lion pride has up to 4 adult males, several adult females, and their cubs. The males are bigger and stronger, so their role in the group is to protect the pride\u2019s territory and defend the cubs from any threats. T\nhe adult females in the group are responsible for hunting. These ladies all work together to bring down bigger animals like buffalo so they can feed the whole group from one hunt.\nThey are extremely fast runners and can reach speeds of 50 mph (80 km/h), but they can\u2019t run this fast for very long.\nGenerally, lions eat their prey at the location of the hunt but sometimes they pull large prey under cover to protect it from scavengers like vultures, hyenas, and other large cats. When food is scarce, cubs suffer the most while all other pride members eat their fill, including the crippled and elderly lions that can live on the leftovers.\nFood can be hard to come by during certain seasons, so lions may go a few days without eating anything, but once the females have a successful hunt, the whole pride with gorge themselves. Lions can eat up to 30 kilograms (66 pounds) in one session and overfill their bellies.\nThe lions may even rest for a few hours before continuing to eat if they are unable to consume all of their prey in one sitting. Lions will also steal the kills of cheetahs and leopards if it is easier than hunting their own food. Sometimes lions will kill leopard and cheetah cubs and even adults when they get the chance.\nLions tend to dominate cheetahs and leopards, which is another reason they are considered kings and queens of the jungle.\nIn human culture, the lion is one of the most widely recognized animal symbols. Lions are widely depicted in paintings, sculptures, in contemporary films and literature and even on national flags. These majestic cats are a symbol of strength and nobility in cultures across Europe, Asia and Africa.\nThey are depicted as the \u201cking of the jungle\u201d or \u201cking of beasts,\u201d and are a popular symbol for royalty, stateliness and sporting teams. In the region of sub-Saharan Africa, lions are a common character in the stories, proverbs and dances practiced by people, but they are rarely featured in visual arts.\nThe word for lion is Swahili, a language spoken in some regions of Africa, is \u201csimba,\u201d (just like in the movie The Lion King) which also means \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cking,\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d\nThe lion continues to appear in modern literature, such as Aslan from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia series by C. S. Lewis. What other movies, books, or stories do you know that feature lions as primary characters?\nLion Vocabulary\nRoyal : A king or queen, prince or princess Pride : A lion\u2019s group or family Territory : The area patrolled and protected by a lion pride Mane : The fur that surrounds the head of a male lion Carnivore : An animal that eats primarily meat Species : A group of animals that are able to have babies together\nLearn More All About Lions\nDo you want to learn even more about the kings and queens of the jungle? Watch this cool 49 minute documentary video about the lives of wild lions in Africa:\nLion Q&A\nQuestion 1: How fast can a lion run?\nAnswer 1: Lions can run very fast for brief periods. A lion can run the length of a football field in six seconds! A lion can run up to 50 mph but only for a very short distance.\nQuestion 2: How do lions take care of their babies?\nAnswer 2: Male lions watch the cubs while mothers hunt. All the mothers care for and feed babies \u2013 even those that aren\u2019t their own.\nQuestion 3: How do lions stay hydrated if water is scarce or it is the dry season?\nAnswer 3: Lions will eat wild melons when water is scarce in order to get moisture and avoid dehydration.\nQuestion 4: Do Lions live in groups or are they solitary animals?\nAnswer 4: Lions live together and are very social. A family of Lions is called a pride. A pride usually has no more than 4 dominant males, many females, and babies.\nQuestion 5: What are baby Lions called?\nAnswer 5: Baby Lions are called cubs, lionet or whelp.\nQuestion 6: What do Lions Eat?\nAnswer 6: Lions love meat and have to have it to survive. In their habitat lions hunt and eat the following \u2013 Zebra, Buffalo and even Elephants. A lion will eat almost anything they feel they can overpower, so nothing is too big for a lion to attack.\nThey don\u2019t always succeed with the likes of Elephants and Rhinos but they keep on trying. It goes without saying Lions will eat almost anything that contains meat.\nQuestion 7: Have Lions got any predators?\nAnswer 7: Yes, even though lions are like royalty of the animal kingdom, they do have one predator: humans. Lion hunting, or trophy hunting as it is known, is still an ongoing problem facing the conservation of this large cat.\nThe majority of trophy hunting is licensed and takes place in countries like Zimbabwe and Namibia. There are less than 25,000 wild lions roaming the African continent, which is a drastic decline compared to the more than 1.2 million that lived in the 1880s.\nEnjoyed the Easy Science for Kids Website all about Lions info?

In a pride, lions hunt prey, raise cubs, and defend their territory together. In prides the females do most of the hunting and cub rearing. Usually all the lionesses in the pride are related\u2014mothers, daughters, grandmothers, and sisters.\nMany of the females in the pride give birth at about the same time. A cub may nurse from other females as well as its mother. Each pride generally will have no more than two adult males.\n0:28\nWhile the females usually live with the pride for life, the males often stay for only two to four years. After that they go off on their own or are evicted by other males who take over the pride. When a new male becomes part of the pride it is not unusual for him to kill all the cubs, ensuring that all future cubs will have his genes. The main job of males in the pride is defending the pride's territory. A male's loud roar, usually heard after sunset, can carry for as far as five miles (eight kilometers). The roar warns off intruders and helps round up stray members of the pride.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nHunting generally is done in the dark by the lionesses. They often hunt in groups of two or three, using teamwork to stalk, surround, and kill their prey. Lionesses aren't the most successful of hunters, because they usually score only one kill out of several tries. After the kill the males usually eat first, lionesses next\u2014and the cubs get what's left. Males and females fiercely defend against any outside lions that attempt to join their pride.\nBecause of their size, strength, and predatory skills, lions are considered one of the \u201cbig cats.\u201d Tigers, cheetahs, leopards, jaguars, and cougars are also part of this grouping.\nTake the big cat quiz to see how much you know about these fierce felines.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Cave Lion images!\nCave Lion Description and Size\nThe cave lion is an extinct species that resembled, but was distinct, from the modern lion. Cave drawings of the lion give some idea of what they may have looked like. For example, cave drawings that date back over 15,000 years suggest that make cave lions did not have a significant mane and they may not have had one at all.\nIt is believed that the cave lion may have been one of the largest species of lions, with a shoulder height of nearly 4 feet, and a length (excluding the tail) of nearly 7 feet. They probably weighed over 700 pounds. The muzzle of the cave lion was longer and narrower than modern lions.\nCave lions were nearly 4 feet tall at the shoulder, and from the tip of their nose to the end of their back, excluding their tail, they were nearly 7 feet long.\nTypes of Cave Lions\nThere were three different species of cave lion or Panthera. They were Panthera spelaea, Panthera leo fossilis, and Panthera atrox. Panthera spelaea is also known as the European or Eurasian cave lion. Panthera leo fossilis is also known as the Early Middle Pleistocene European cave lion, and Panthera atrox is also known as the American cave lion.\nBoth the American and Eurasian cave lion descended from the Early Middle Pleistocene European cave lion. Studies of mitochondrial DNA indicate that the Eurasian and American cave lions share sister lineage. The American cave lion probably developed when cave lions in America became isolated south of the North American continental ice sheet.\nWhat Did Cave Lions Eat?\nThe majority of the cave lions\u2019 diet was made up of reindeer. They would occasionally make a meal of young bear cubs, but they were much more finicky than modern lions, which eat whatever they are able to catch.\nArticles Mentioning Cave Lion See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles.\nHabitat: Where Cave Lions Lived\nThe cave lion had a huge range. It made its home from Canada and Alaska across the Bering land bridge, throughout the mammoth steppe, which ran from Spain across Eurasia and from the Arctic circle south to China. This included the Iberian Peninsula, Great Britain, Southeast, and Central Europe, northern Eurasia, and the East Europe Plain.\nDespite the name, it isn\u2019t believed that cave lions lived in caves. They probably lived in the open, much like members of the modern-day Panthera genus.\nCave Lion Predators and Threats\nThe cave lion had no natural predators other than prehistoric humans. There is evidence that the cave lion was hunted and skinned for their pelts, which may have led to their extinction.\nCave Lion Discoveries and Fossils: Where It Was Found\nA pair of cave lion cubs were found in permafrost in Yakutia, Siberia. It is believed they were buried by a landslide, which allowed them to be surprisingly well preserved. It is estimated that these cubs were between 25,000 and 55,000 years old.\nOther frozen specimens have been found in similar areas. Researchers determined through carbon dating that two cubs found approximately 50 feet apart and presumed to be siblings actually lived around 15,000 years apart.\nThe first fossils of the American cave lion were found in 1830. It was a partial jawbone and was discovered in Mississippi. The next fossils weren\u2019t recovered until 1907. Although they weren\u2019t identified as belonging to the American cave lion until 1907, they were discovered in 1803 in Alaska.\nOver 80 individual cave lion fossils were recovered in La Brea, California through the early and mid-1900s.\nExtinction: When Did Cave Lions Die Out\nIt is hard to determine exactly why the cave lion became extinct. It is known that prehistoric humans hunted the cave lion for its pelts. It is possible that the hunting pressure on these animals drove them into extinction.\nSimilar Animals To the Cave Lion\nThe cave lion is in the genus Panthera, which includes the modern-day lion, jaguar, tiger, and leopard. Some researchers, after studying the skull shapes of different members of the Panthera genus, believe the cave lion may be more closely related to modern-day tigers than modern lions.\nAnimals That Lived at the Same Time as Cave Lions\nOther animals that lived alongside cave lions included saber-tooth tigers, woolly mammoths, cave bears, and steppe bison.\nSaber-Tooth Tigers \u2013 Recognizable by their curved canine teeth that were visible even when the mouth was closed.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion | Smithsonian's National Zoo", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/lion", "text": "Social Structure\nLions are the world's most social felines. They live in groups of related females, called prides, which may comprise several to as many as 40 individuals, including adults, sub-adults (between the ages of 2 and 4) and cubs, plus one or more resident males. Abundance of prey availability plays a significant role in the size of a lion pride. Pride mates associate in sub-groups within the pride.\nFemales usually stay in their mothers' prides for life, unless food scarcity forces them out. Young males are driven from their prides when they grow large enough to compete with the dominant males (usually between the ages of 2 and 4). They create coalitions, usually with brothers and cousins, and search for a pride to take over. Males entering a new pride will kill all cubs that cannot run from them. Adult males that are fortunate enough to achieve residency within a pride hold tenure for an average of two years, often leaving due to eviction by another coalition of males. In India, female and male lions live apart, joining only to mate.\nMales take on most of the defensive duties. However, both males and females mark their territories by roaring \u2014 which can be heard up to five miles away \u2014 and scent marking with urine. Females raise the cubs and are the primary hunters, although males will sometimes join females during a hunt. Depending on the prey item, several lions may stalk prey from different angles to within 100 feet (30 meters) before attacking the targeted animal. Nomadic males must hunt alone or scavenge from other animals."}

Vulnerable LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Decreasing\nWhat is the African lion?\nAfrican lions have been admired throughout history for as symbols of courage and strength. These iconic animals have powerful bodies\u2014in the cat family, they\u2019re second in size only to tigers\u2014and roars that can be heard from five miles away. An adult lion\u2019s coat is yellow-gold, and juveniles have some light spots that disappear with age. Only male lions typically boast manes, the impressive fringe of long hair that encircles their heads.\nHabitat\nAfrican lions once roamed most of Africa and parts of Asia and Europe. But the species has disappeared from 94 percent of its historic range and can only be found today in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. These lions mainly stick to the grasslands, scrub, or open woodlands where they can more easily hunt their prey, but they can live in most habitats aside from tropical rainforests and deserts.\nAsiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) are a subspecies of African lion, but only one very small population survives in India's Gir Forest.\nLion prides and hunting\nLions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides\u2014though there is one population of solitary lions. Prides are family units that may comprise anywhere from two to 40 lions\u2014including up to to three or four males, a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride's lionesses are related, and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. Young males eventually leave and establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male.\nMales defend the pride's territory, marking the area with urine, roaring menacingly to warn intruders, and chasing off animals that encroach on their turf.\nFemale lions are the pride's primary hunters and leaders. They often work together to prey upon antelopes, zebras, wildebeest, and other large animals of the open grasslands. Many of these animals are faster than lions, so teamwork pays off. Female lions also raise their cubs communally.\nAfter the hunt, the group effort often degenerates to squabbling over the sharing of the kill, with cubs at the bottom of the pecking order. Young lions do not help to hunt until they are about a year old. Lions will hunt alone if the opportunity presents itself, and they also steal kills from hyenas or wild dogs.\nThreats to survival\nToday, there are only half as many African lions than there were 25 years ago. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that fewer than 25,000 lions remain in Africa, which is why the organization classifies them as vulnerable to extinction.\nAfrican lions face a variety of threats\u2014most of which can be attributed to humans. Fearing that lions will prey on their livestock, which can be a significant financial blow, ranchers may kill the animals both in retaliation and as a preventative measure, sometimes using pesticides as poison. Poachers target the species, too, as their bones and other body parts are valuable in the illegal wildlife trade.\nThe role trophy hunting plays is controversial. Mismanaged hunting in the past has caused lions to disappear from some habitats, while hunters and those involved in the industry say hunting fees generate money for lion conservation. National Geographic Explorer Craig Packer, however, has said the amount generated by hunting is so \"underwhelming\u2026[that] it\u2019s no wonder that despite years of lion hunting being allowed in [some] countries, the lion population has plummeted.\"\nFurther fueling this conflict between lions and humans is the loss of prey across the species\u2019 range. African lions prey on large herbivores, a population that\u2019s being hunted for an increasingly commercial bushmeat trade. The IUCN estimates these populations have declined by as much as 52 percent in East Africa and 85 percent in West Africa. With less food available in the wild, lions may be more likely to turn to hunting domesticated animals like livestock.\nConservation\nHelping humans learn how to live with lions is key to ensuring their survival. Conservation organizations are working to change attitudes toward lions through compensation initiatives. Some of these models offer communities financial rewards when their local lion populations rise, while others pay farmers to replace their livestock that have been killed by lions.\nOther conservationists have focused on creating protected areas for lions. In Botswana\u2019s Selinda area, only a single lioness and her cub lived there when filmmakers Dereck and Beverly Joubert, both National Geographic Explorers, turned the land into a protected reserve and photographic tourism camp. Now about a hundred lions roam the reserve.\nIn Mozambique\u2019s Zambezi Delta, where the effects of a protracted civil war caused lion numbers to plummet, the largest-ever lion translocation project brought in 24 lions from South Africa in 2018\u2014they\u2019re now settled in and starting to have cubs.\n4:14"}

Most hunting often takes place at dusk. Apart from that African lions spend much of their time resting. They rest in order to save energy, in the absence of prey, or to escape the midday heat. African lions are highly social animals, gathering in groups or prides, which include up to 3 male lions and multiple lionesses with their young. Prides are defended by males, who patrol and mark the territory. However, there's harsh competition between males for the territory and position in the pride. In a case, if another male overcomes the leading male of the pride, he usually kills all cubs, sired by the previous male. Meanwhile, males do not tend to hunt due to their slow speed and eye-catching appearance. Instead, hunting is left to females of the pride, who hunt in groups, cooperating with each other during their hunting trips. The females are excellent hunters: they are faster and more agile than males, able to hunt down animals that are much bigger and faster than them."}

The largest of these was the Barbary lion of North Africa, which measured some 27\u201330 feet long with a long, serpentine tail of 3.5 feet.\nGeneticists have identified two subspecies of lion: Panthera leo leo (found in India, North, Central, and West Africa) and P. l. melanochaita (in Eastern and Southern Africa). These lions have coats that range in color from nearly white to tawny yellow, ash brown, ochre, and deep orange-brown. They have a tuft of dark fur at the tip of their tail, are typically about 5.5\u20138.5 feet long and weigh between 330 and 550 pounds. Male and female lions exhibit sexual dimorphism: Female lions are smaller than males and have a uniformly colored coat of a tawny brown color. Females also lack a mane. Males have a thick, woolly mane of fur that frames their face and covers their neck.\nLions' closest living relatives are the Jaguars, followed by leopards and tigers. They have two recognized extinct ancestors, the American lion (Panthera atrox) and the cave lion (Panthera fossilis).\nAprison Photography/Getty Images\nHabitat and Range\nAlthough they primarily are found in savanna areas, lions can be found everywhere in Africa, except the tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert. They live in habitats from sea level to the mountain slopes up to 13,700 feet, including Mt. Kilimanjaro.\nThe dry deciduous Gir forest of northwest India contains a lion preserve known as the Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Surrounding the sanctuary is an area inhabited by ethnic Maldharies pastoralists and their livestock.\nDiet\nLions are carnivores, a subgroup of mammals that also includes animals such as bears, dogs, raccoons, mustelids, civets, hyenas, and the aardwolf. Lion prey preference is for medium to large ungulates like gemsbok and other antelopes, buffalo, giraffes, zebras, and wildebeest; however, they will eat almost any animal, from rodents to rhinoceros. They avoid animals with sharp horns (like sable antelope), or animals smart enough to graze in large herds (like elands). Warthogs are smaller than lion typical preferences, but since they are common in the savannas, they are common parts of lion diets. In India, lions eat domestic cattle when available, but mostly consume wild Chital deer.\nLions drink water when available, but otherwise, get required moisture from their prey or from plants like tsamma melons in the Kalahari desert.\nBehavior\nLions live in densities between 1.5 to 55 adult animals per 38.6 square miles (1 square kilometer). They are social creatures and live in groups of about four to six adults called prides. Prides typically include two males and three or four females and their offspring; the adults leave the pride to hunt in pairs or singly. Prides in India tend to be smaller in size, with two females.\nLions play-fight as a means of honing their hunting skills. When they play-fight, they don't bare their teeth and keep their claws retracted so as to not inflict injury on their partner. Play-fighting is a training and practice exercise, to assist in efficiency in tackling prey and to establish relationships among the pride members. It is during play that lions work out which members of the pride are to chase and corner their quarry and which members of the pride are the ones to go in for a kill.\nReproduction and Offspring\nLions reproduce sexually. They mate year-round, but breeding usually peaks during the rainy season. Their gestation lasts between 110 and 119 days. A litter usually consists of between one and six lion cubs, the average is between 2\u20133.\nNewborn cubs are born weighing between 27\u201356 ounces. They are blind and deaf at first: their eyes and ears open within the first two weeks. Lion cubs begin to hunt at 5\u20136 months and stay with their mothers until they are between 18 months and 3 years. Females reach sexual maturity at 4 years and males at 5 years.\nLuxy Images/Getty Images\nEvolutionary History\nToday there are less than 40,000 lions on our planet, but lions were much more common and widespread in the past: They disappeared from Europe during the first century CE, and from the Middle East and most of Asia by 1950.\nModern cats first appeared about 10.8 million years ago. Lions, along with jaguars, leopards, tigers, snow leopards, and clouded leopards, split off from all other cat lineages early in the evolution of the cat family and today form what is known as the Panthera lineage. Lions shared a common ancestor with jaguars which lived about 810,000 years ago.\nConservation Status\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies all subspecies of the lion as vulnerable, and in 2013, the ECOS Environmental Conservation Online System in the United States classified P.l. leo as endangered, and P.l. melanochaita as threatened.\nThreats\nMajor threats to lions include habitat and prey loss resulting from a growing human population and climate change, as well as invasive species, agricultural effluents, diseases like canine distemper, and human retaliation for lion attacks.\nIllegal hunting and poaching for medicinal purposes and trophies have also impacted lion populations. Legal sport hunting is considered a useful management tool, providing needed income at sanctuary facilities if it is conducted at a sustainable offtake of about one male lion per 775 square miles. Levels higher than that have been documented in several countries in Africa as detrimental to the overall lion populations.\nSources"}

These lion species are extinct and inhabited the forests of Australia years ago.\nWhere does a marsupial lion live?\nThe marsupial lions resided in South Australia 1,600,000-46,000 years ago. Their fossils were found on the Nullarbor Plain. Cave paintings of these lion species were first seen in Northwest Australia in the year 2006. Their fossil footprints, along with the jawbone preserved in limestone, were discovered in a dried-out lake, present in Southeast Victoria in the year 2009. Their fossils were found extensively in various parts of Australia, including the Darling Downs in Queensland, Wellington caves in New South Wales, and Naracoorte caves in South Australia. Fossils were also seen in large numbers in the Thylacoleo cave on the Nullarbor Plain, which is located in Western Australia.\nWhat is a marsupial lion's habitat?\nThe extinct marsupial lions used to inhabit the forests of Australia, and the paleontological evidence also suggests that they used to inhabit dry open forest regions which were in close proximity to the waterbodies.\nWho does a marsupial lion live with?\nNot much information is available on the social life of marsupial lions. However, cave paintings and several other paleontological findings shed some light on the savage hunting skills of the lion, which terrorized ancient Australia during its reign.\nHow long does a marsupial lion live?\nThere is no information available on the lifespan of marsupial lions.\nHow do they reproduce?\nAlthough not much evidence is found on the reproductive behavior of these lions belonging to the Thylacoleo genus, it can be derived that they exhibited the characteristic features of other marsupial animals. Sexual dimorphism was seen in these animals. Just like other mammals, they directly give birth to their babies. The babies are delivered at their embryonic stage, and later, they develop inside the pouch of their female parents. The placenta of the females is yolk sacs, which provide the nutrients required for the growth ad development of the baby inside. Their gestation period lasts only about six to seven weeks. Within their pouch, the developing embryo is nourished with milk. After reaching the juvenile stage, the babies tend to leave the pouch for a short while and return to seek warmth.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe marsupial lion (Thylacoleo carnifex) is listed as an Extinct species by the IUCN belonging to the Thylacoleo genus. This ambush predator lived approximately 1,600,000-46,000 years ago. Human activities are considered to be the main cause of their extinction. Ancient humans were thought to hunt down these animals for their flesh. Habitat loss and changing climate also contributed to their extinction.\nMarsupial Lion Fun Facts\nWhat does a marsupial lion look like?\nResearchers found the bones of these extinct species in various parts of Australia. The marsupial lion skull is quite small, with the presence of postorbital bar seen in other primates. They used to possess sharp serrated incisors that resembled canines. The structure of their hind feet bones provides evidence that these animals were not agile runners and used to hunt their prey with more of a trotting movement. Further, the paleontologic shreds of evidence obtained from their hind feet show that these animal species were good at climbing trees. Their small skull size had a wide jaw that contained sharp teeth, which were capable of inflicting a powerful bite on their prey. Researchers also found evidence of retractable claws encased in a sheath in this predator. The tail bones suggest that the tail of these mammals was a powerful body part. The tail helped them to climb trees. The marsupial lions also used their tail along with their limbs to balance their body and ward off their predators.\nHow cute are they?\nThey are not cute because of their savage looks, which include sharp claws and teeth. These animals existed years ago and terrorized entire ancient Australia.\nHow do they communicate?\nNot much information is available on the modes of communication of these mammals. However, just like other marsupials, they are thought to possess olfactory and auditory modes of communication.\nHow big is a marsupial lion?\nThe marsupial lion size is about 5 ft (152.4 cm) and 2 ft (61 cm) in height. They are way bigger in size than the marsupial animal Pilbara ningaui.\nHow fast can a marsupial lion run?\nThe evidence collected from their fossil suggests that these animals were slow runners and instead used a trotting motion to chase animals. Their fossil of tail bones also suggests that they were great climbers.\nHow much does a marsupial lion weigh?\nResearchers give an estimation on the weight of these animals to be about 286.6 lb (130 kg).\nWhat are the male and female names of the species?\nNo specific names are given to the male and female species of the extinct marsupial lion.\nWhat would you call a baby marsupial lion?\nA baby marsupial lion is called a cub.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe marsupial lion fossil suggests that they were carnivorous animals and preyed on a variety of animals. These animals are also considered scavengers as they ate the flesh of carrion.\nAre they dangerous?\nThese animals were dangerous predators and used to terrorize entire ancient Australia with their savage hunting skills.\nWould they make a good pet?\nThese animals were ambush predators. They are also extinct.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nThe skull discovery of this animal first took place in the year 1956, and the entire skeleton, except the foot and the tail, was discovered at Moree, NSW, in 1966. Many paleontologists suggest that these animals were linked to the herbivores, while others think that they are linked to a possum ancestor (Phalangeroidea).\nDid the marsupial lion have a pouch?\nJust like other marsupial animals, these predators also had a pouch in which their cubs underwent their developing stage.\nWhy did the marsupial lion go extinct?\nThe main reason attributed to the extinction of these animals is humans. Climate change could be another contributing factor, with the disappearance of their prey also aiding their extinction.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Cave Lion images!\nCave Lion Description and Size\nThe cave lion is an extinct species that resembled, but was distinct, from the modern lion. Cave drawings of the lion give some idea of what they may have looked like. For example, cave drawings that date back over 15,000 years suggest that make cave lions did not have a significant mane and they may not have had one at all.\nIt is believed that the cave lion may have been one of the largest species of lions, with a shoulder height of nearly 4 feet, and a length (excluding the tail) of nearly 7 feet. They probably weighed over 700 pounds. The muzzle of the cave lion was longer and narrower than modern lions.\nCave lions were nearly 4 feet tall at the shoulder, and from the tip of their nose to the end of their back, excluding their tail, they were nearly 7 feet long.\nTypes of Cave Lions\nThere were three different species of cave lion or Panthera. They were Panthera spelaea, Panthera leo fossilis, and Panthera atrox. Panthera spelaea is also known as the European or Eurasian cave lion. Panthera leo fossilis is also known as the Early Middle Pleistocene European cave lion, and Panthera atrox is also known as the American cave lion.\nBoth the American and Eurasian cave lion descended from the Early Middle Pleistocene European cave lion. Studies of mitochondrial DNA indicate that the Eurasian and American cave lions share sister lineage. The American cave lion probably developed when cave lions in America became isolated south of the North American continental ice sheet.\nWhat Did Cave Lions Eat?\nThe majority of the cave lions\u2019 diet was made up of reindeer. They would occasionally make a meal of young bear cubs, but they were much more finicky than modern lions, which eat whatever they are able to catch.\nArticles Mentioning Cave Lion See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles.\nHabitat: Where Cave Lions Lived\nThe cave lion had a huge range. It made its home from Canada and Alaska across the Bering land bridge, throughout the mammoth steppe, which ran from Spain across Eurasia and from the Arctic circle south to China. This included the Iberian Peninsula, Great Britain, Southeast, and Central Europe, northern Eurasia, and the East Europe Plain.\nDespite the name, it isn\u2019t believed that cave lions lived in caves. They probably lived in the open, much like members of the modern-day Panthera genus.\nCave Lion Predators and Threats\nThe cave lion had no natural predators other than prehistoric humans. There is evidence that the cave lion was hunted and skinned for their pelts, which may have led to their extinction.\nCave Lion Discoveries and Fossils: Where It Was Found\nA pair of cave lion cubs were found in permafrost in Yakutia, Siberia. It is believed they were buried by a landslide, which allowed them to be surprisingly well preserved. It is estimated that these cubs were between 25,000 and 55,000 years old.\nOther frozen specimens have been found in similar areas. Researchers determined through carbon dating that two cubs found approximately 50 feet apart and presumed to be siblings actually lived around 15,000 years apart.\nThe first fossils of the American cave lion were found in 1830. It was a partial jawbone and was discovered in Mississippi. The next fossils weren\u2019t recovered until 1907. Although they weren\u2019t identified as belonging to the American cave lion until 1907, they were discovered in 1803 in Alaska.\nOver 80 individual cave lion fossils were recovered in La Brea, California through the early and mid-1900s.\nExtinction: When Did Cave Lions Die Out\nIt is hard to determine exactly why the cave lion became extinct. It is known that prehistoric humans hunted the cave lion for its pelts. It is possible that the hunting pressure on these animals drove them into extinction.\nSimilar Animals To the Cave Lion\nThe cave lion is in the genus Panthera, which includes the modern-day lion, jaguar, tiger, and leopard. Some researchers, after studying the skull shapes of different members of the Panthera genus, believe the cave lion may be more closely related to modern-day tigers than modern lions.\nAnimals That Lived at the Same Time as Cave Lions\nOther animals that lived alongside cave lions included saber-tooth tigers, woolly mammoths, cave bears, and steppe bison.\nSaber-Tooth Tigers \u2013 Recognizable by their curved canine teeth that were visible even when the mouth was closed.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "15 Roar-some Facts About The White Lion That Kids Will Love", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/white-lion-facts", "text": "White Lion Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is a white lion?\nAs evident by their name, the white lion is a lion species native to the Kruger and Timbavati region of South Africa. The white lion is yellow blonde to almost white in color because of a rare gene mutation. They are not albinos, but the mutation derives from a similar gene that causes the albino mutation.\nWhat class of animal does a white lion belong to?\nLike all lions and wild cats in general, white lions are mammals, which means that they give birth to live offspring. Unfortunately, even though they are considered sacred by many, their numbers in the wild are almost non-existent because of trophy hunting programs. The liger and the Bengal tiger belong to the same class as these magnificent white lions.\nHow many white lions are there in the world?\nThe first recorded sighting of the white lion happened in 1938, but many people claim that they have been around for centuries before that. They are found in the Kruger and Timbavati region of South Africa, and they did become extinct in the wild after an increase in killings for trophy hunting. As of now, the little number that is left of them in the wild is all thanks to reintroduction programs that were implemented as a measure of stabilizing their population and prevent the hunting of these animals. There are hundreds of them kept in captivity too, in zoos like Belgrade Zoo and the Lion Nature Reserve in Kruger National Park. It is estimated that there are just 13 of them left in the wild.\nWhere does a white lion live?\nTheir origin is the Timbavati region of Africa. However, they went extinct from the wild a while ago and they are now mostly kept in wildlife parks and nature reserves around the world. A few of them were reintroduced to their natural habitat, and they seem to have been doing well since this reintroduction.\nWhat is a white lion's habitat?\nTheir preferred habitats are arid plains, woods, and savanna grasslands in Africa. They have been known to be surprisingly good at camouflaging themselves in these areas, which helps them to stalk and ambush their prey.\nWho do white lions live with?\nWhite lions, like all lions, are known to live in a pride consisting of a few lioness members and one lion member as well as lion cubs. However, as there are not many of them left in the wild, this setting is artificially created in zoos and wildlife parks like in the Nwanetsi region in Kruger National Park. These African lions have also been reintroduced in their natural habitat in the Timbavati region. They have been observed to be breeding successfully, which has caused the lion population to grow a little here.\nHow long does a white lion live?\nOn average, white lions have a lifespan of about 18 years. However, some have been known to live longer if taken care of properly. Thankfully, their unique coloration is not noticed to have any impact on their lifespan.\nHow do they reproduce?\nMost white lions are born in captivity in breeding camps. In captivity, these African lions are known to breed annually. However, in the wild, they have been noticed to breed once every two years. A lioness is generally known for giving birth to two to four cubs, and these cubs are born vulnerable and blind. These cubs rely on their mothers to take care of them until they are completely independent and old enough to hunt on their own. Unfortunately, white lions have been known to face inbreeding for animal shows and wildlife parks. Many conservationists believe that this is a dangerous and harmful practice.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nAfrican lions are listed as a Vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List, even though the white lion species specifically is not evaluated in their list. White lions are members of the general lion family, the only exception being the rarity of their gene that impacts their coloration. Unfortunately, they faced extinction in the wild at one point.\nWhite Lion Fun Facts\nWhat do white lions look like?\nWhite lions are known for having a mutation in their gene pool that causes their colors to be somewhat different. They are not albinos as they lack this particular pigmentation. Their eyes are generally blue or gold in color, with a black nose and dark-colored patches behind the ears. The manes of male white lions are usually yellowish blonde or white in color, as are the tips of their tail. A female white lion does not have a mane. The cubs look pretty similar to adults.\nHow cute are they?\nThe white lion is adorable with its blonde to whitish color caused by a rarity in its gene pool, and its blue and gold eyes. They are a true rarity among other lions and they look almost regal in their appearance, which, unfortunately, attracted hunters and caused their numbers to deteriorate.\nHow do they communicate?\nLike all lions, white lions communicate through vocalizations. They have a loud white lion roar to warn away potential threats and produce a soft chuffing sound to communicate with members of their pride. This lion also uses tactile means to communicate with its offspring and other white lions as well.\nHow big is a white lion?\nThe white lion has an average length of about 6-10 ft (1.8-3 m) and a height of about 3.6-4 ft (1.1-1.2 m), which is about the same size as a big ostrich.\nHow fast can a white lion run?\nThe white lion belongs to the same family as the South African lion, so it can be assumed that their speed matches that of white lions. South African lions have a top speed of about 50.3 mph (81 kph)!\nHow much does a white lion weigh?\nWhite lions are one of the heaviest wild cats, with an average weight of about 380-530 lb (172.3-240.4 kg).\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nThere are no specific names for male and female white lions. Males are simply called male white lions, while females are called female white lions.\nWhat would you call a baby white lion?\nThe babies of lions of any kind, whether they are white lions or not, are called lion cubs or offspring. These cubs are pretty vulnerable at birth and they depend on their mothers for some time before they can become independent and hunt on their own.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe rare white lion species is carnivorous, just like other lions, and they are known for hunting a variety of animals, both herbivores and carnivores. They prefer wildebeest, hares, gazelles, tortoises, zebras, hyenas, and other types of wild animals. They usually stalk their prey as a pride and ambush it when the right time strikes.\nAre they dangerous?\nWild cats, in general, possess a danger, and the white lion animal is no different. The main reason for this is their unpredictable nature. So, even if they seem approachable at first, it is important not to approach them because they can end up hurting you if they see you as a potential threat.\nWould they make a good pet?\nWhite lions do not make good pets. The main reason for this is their unpredictable nature. These lions also need a lot of space to roam around in, which you will not be able to provide in a home setting, not to mention the fact that they need a lot of food which is not something that an average pet owner can easily provide.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nAn interesting fact about these white lions is that, unlike tawny lions, they have blue or gold eyes that give them an amazing regal appearance!\nA white lion is a luxury, and the price to buy one is estimated to be around $138,000.\nCan you have a white lion as a pet?\nIt is not recommended to own a white lion as a pet as they are wild cats and possess the unpredictable nature typical of wild cats. They should only be handled by experienced lion handlers.\nCan white lions survive in the wild?\nSince they were reintroduced to their natural habitat in the Timbavati region in Africa, they have been observed to have adapted well, so it can be assumed that they can survive in the wild.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

{"animal": "lion", "title": "African Lion - The Animal Facts", "url": "https://www.theanimalfacts.com/mammals/african-lion/", "text": "Habitat\nMost of the African continent forms home for African lions apart from the Sahara desert and rainforests.\nReproduction\nNo set breeding season exists for African lions. The female will go into oestrous multiple times throughout the year and at each of these times can mate with many males. When she finds a male to mate with she will not eat for an entire day as the pair will mate 20 to 40 times.\nOnce a successful mating it takes 110 days for the birth to occur. A den is created by the female away from the rest of the pride. One to four cubs are born with small round spots on their body and occasionally they will have stripes. They are also blind for the first week of their life. During their first four to six weeks of life the cubs are tucked away in the den. The mother will hunt alone near to this den so she can be close to the cubs. During this time they will gain strength and learn to walk.\nAfter this period they can go back to the pride. Here they may suckle from any of the females as most will have given birth at the same time. When in a pride the cubs have twice the chance of surviving. That only apply's if the same male is at the helm though. A new male taking over the pride would kill all the cubs under one year old to make sure all of the cubs are his own.\nCubs no longer drink milk after 6 to 7 months. After 3 years a male is able to reproduce for the first time. Females mature much later at about 4-5 years.\nBehavior\n20 hours of the African lion days will be spent sleeping. Most of their activity takes place once the sun begins to go down with large amount of vocalising and grooming. In the dawn time they will go out on the hunt.\nAfrican Lions are the only big cats to form groups. These groups are known as prides. They consist of 1 or 2 males, five or six females and the cubs. Some lions live as nomads. These African lions spend their day roaming around on their own.\nLions have a range of vocalisations including snarls, hisses, coughs, miaows and woofs. The most popular of these though are the roar. Lions roars are used to advertise their presence. This call is the loudest of all the big cats and can be heard 8 km (5.0 miles) away.\nQuick facts\nThe lion is the most studied of all the world\u2019s cats.\nLions are regularly seen in pop culture. Some famous lions include Simba from The Lion King, the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer mascot, the cowardly lion and Elsa from the movie Born Free. They are also seen in heraldry and as the mascots of sports teams.\nThe Swahili word for lion is simba. This also means \u201cking, \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201caggressive."}

For example, their mane makes them easily identifiable. Learn more about these fascinating creatures in this post.\nLions Description\nThe lion is one of the world\u2019s most iconic animals. These massive felines can be found across Africa and parts of Asia. Lions are known for their strength, power, and majestic manes. While they may appear to be ferocious predators, lions are also highly social animals that typically live in groups called prides. Learn more about these impressive creatures in our latest blog post.\nLions Habitat\nLions are found in Africa and India. In Africa, they inhabit grassy plains, woodlands, savannas, thorny scrublands, riverine forests and mountain slopes. They are also found in the Gir forest of India. Lions prefer areas with dense vegetation and plenty of prey. They typically avoid open areas such as deserts or dambos. Lions are very adaptable and can live in a wide range of habitats as long as there is enough food and water available.\nLions are social animals and live in groups called prides. A pride typically consists of several related females, their cubs and a few adult males. Lions are very territorial and will defend their pride\u2019s territory from other Lions.\nLions Diet\nLions are predators that hunt and feed on other animals. The typical lion diet consists of antelopes, zebra, buffalo, wild hogs, warthogs, and wildebeest. Lions will also eat smaller prey like rodents, reptiles, and birds. In fact, a full-grown lion can consume up to 40 pounds of meat in a single day! Lions typically hunt in groups, using their size and strength to overpower their prey. However, they are also capable of hunting solo if necessary. Lions typically eat their fill and then drag the carcass into the tall grass or bushes to hide it from other predators. Lions will return to the same kill site several times to feed on the carcass until it is completely gone.\nLions Size\nLions are the largest cats in the world, with adult males averaging between 400 and 550 pounds. Females are smaller, typically weighing between 275 and 400 pounds. Lions are also among the tallest cats, with adults measuring up to 4 feet at the shoulder. Despite their massive size, lions are quite agile, capable of reaching speeds of up to 50 miles per hour when running. They are also powerful swimmers, although they usually avoid water unless they are hunting for prey. Lions typically live for about 15 years in the wild, although captive lions have been known to live for up to 30 years.\nLions Lifespan\nLions are one of the most iconic animals on the African continent. They are also one of the longest living members of the cat family, with a lifespan of up to 14 years in the wild and up to 20 years in captivity. Lions typically live in prides of around 30 individuals, which consist of Related females and their cubs, and a few unrelated males. The pride\u2019s territory ranges from 10 to 400 square miles, and they use a combination of vocalizations, scent marking, and body language to communicate with each other. Lions are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. However, due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, their numbers have declined significantly in recent years.\nLions Behavior\nLions are considered one of the most social of all cats. They live in family groups called prides which usually consist of around 30 lions. The pride will work together to defend their territory and cubs from other Lions. Although Lions typically hunt alone or in pairs, on occasion they will work together as a group to take down large prey. When Lions are not hunting or eating, they can often be seen lounging around in the shade or taking a nap. Although they may appear lazy, Lions are actually quite active and spend a large portion of their day walking and stalking their prey. Lions are very powerful animals and have no natural predators. The only time Lions are truly in danger is when humans invade their territory.\nLions Speed\nLions are one of the fastest animals on land, capable of reaching speeds of up to 80 kilometers per hour. This speed is essential for hunting, as lions often need to chase down their prey. Lions are also able to maintain their speed over long distances, allowing them to cover a great deal of ground in a short period of time. In addition to their speed, lions are also known for their strength and agility. Their powerful muscles allow them to leap great distances and bring down large animals. Taken together, these characteristics make lions formidable predators that are well-suited to life on the African plains.\nLions Hunting\nMost lions live in Africa, where they hunt for antelope, zebra, and other large prey. Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides. A pride consists of related females and their young, along with a few adult males. The females do most of the hunting, working together to stalk and ambush their prey. Lions are good swimmers and climbers, but they are also fast runners, able to reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour over short distances. When a pride takes down a large animal, they eat their fill and then rest for several hours before starting to hunt again. Lions typically hunt at night, when it is cooler and their prey is less alert.\nConclusion\nLions are some of the most majestic creatures on earth. With their powerful manes and impressive roar, they are one of nature\u2019s most awe-inspiring predators. As we have seen, lions play an important role in the African ecosystem and should be protected for future generations. What do you think can be done to help protect these animals?

We can\u2019t get enough of these majestic big cats, so we\u2019ve compiled a list of interesting facts about lions.\nScientifically named Panthera Leo, the lion is one of five big cats, along with the tiger, leopard, snow leopard and jaguar, that form part of the genus Panthera in the Felidae family.\nTo get you excited for your dream safari in Southern Africa, we\u2019re sharing a collection of interesting facts about these incredible creatures.\nLove lions? Read about South Africa\u2019s infamous Mapogo lion coalition and their notorious rule over the Sabi Sands.\nThe Social Structure and Pride Organisation of Lions\nThe only social cat species in the animal kingdom, lions live in social structures called a \u201cpride.\u201d\nThe size of a lion pride varies widely, and the structures may also differ between that of the African and Asian lion prides. Lions typically live in prides of up to 40 members, with the average pride consisting of about 14 members.\nIn some prides, lions divide themselves into gender-specific groups, seeing males and females remain separate, except at mating time.\nThe females form the core of the pride, with closely-related females \u2013 mothers, daughters and cousins \u2013 usually spending their entire lives in the same pride that they were born into.\nIf a lioness leaves a pride, she is usually not welcomed into a new group of lions, and typically does not survive for long. Lion prides are usually described as matriarchal, with communal care for the young.\nIt is quite different for male lions who are not as homebound as the females. Male cubs will only remain in the pride that they were born into until they are about 2 to 3 years of age.\nAfter that, they then become wandering nomads for about two years until taking over another pride or forming a new pride at around the age of five.\nAs the leader, the defender and protector, the dominant male lion will mate with all of the females in the pride and will also defend the group against other males who may try to take over. On average, male lions can usually keep control of a pride for about 4 years.\nRarely remaining part of a pride for more than 4 to 5 years, once they are no longer capable of fathering cubs, male lions are usually driven from the group. A pride with older males is ripe for takeover by a coalition, a group of young nomad males, that breeding cycles may continue.\nMale Lion Coalitions\nSome male lions, usually young nomads, will form a \u201ccoalition.\u201d In most cases, coalitions are comprised of male lions that are often related. Predominantly for survival purposes, male lions in a coalition may take over an existing pride in order to reproduce and continue their bloodline.\nDuring this kind of takeover, the coalition has to evict the resident males from the targeted group. This confrontation is usually violent and the weaker male lions are killed.\nThe victorious male lions that have taken over the new pride will kill all of the existing cubs belonging to the previous males. This act of infanticide accelerates the females readiness to mate with one of the newcomers.\nOne of the most infamous lion coalitions to ever roam the earth was the Mapogo lion coalition. This band of six brothers came together and ruthlessly dominated the plains of the Sabi Sands. Wiping out pride after pride, the Mapogos became known for their brutalist dominating tactics. They were so well-known, a documentary, Brothers in Blood: The Lions of Sabi Sand, was created about them. If you want to learn more about this fascinating lion coalition, read our post on The Mighty Mapogos.\nLion Hunting Tactics\nFemale lions tend to do the majority of the hunting for the pride, stealthily working together as a group and using intelligent hunting tactics to catch their prey. While hunting may take place whenever the chance arises, it is typically done at night or in the early mornings\nWhile lions are not very fast or nimble creatures, by contrast, the animals they hunt are some of the fastest on the planet. Consequently, lions have developed specific, strategic hunting methods.\nThe first method is for a lion to stalk its prey until they are close enough to give a burst of speed and pounce on the animal unexpectedly. The second is to find a bush close to something their prey needs, typically a water source, hide close by, and wait for the opportunity to attack.\nAs well as being incredibly good at hiding, lions are phenomenally patient and can use their strength and sense rather than speed to catch their prey.\nThe Mating and Breeding Habits of Lions\nMating\nLions typically reach sexual maturation by about two years old. By the age of four, most lionesses have already birthed at least one cub.\nLionesses will go into heat several times a year. In these periods, they will mate with one or more male lions countless times over the period of a few days. Lionesses do not have a specific sexual period or cycle, and in fact, mate repeatedly, as often as physically possible, in order to kickstart the ovulation process for reproduction.\nBirthing Process\nOnce a female lioness is fertilised, the gestation period lasts for 15 weeks. When giving birth, the lioness will retreat to a secluded den area such as a marsh, cave or mountain hill, to protect the newborns from predators such as hyenas or nomad males looking to take over their territory.\nLionesses can give birth to one to five cubs in each litter and are able to give birth every two years.\nOnce a lioness has returned to the pride with her new cubs, she will raise them alongside other new mothers. This is termed as nursery group or \u201ccreche.\u201d\nLionesses within the same pride often synchronise their ovulation in order to gestate and give birth around the same time. The advantage of this close association is that multiple mothers are available to defend the cubs against potential infanticidal males.\nLion Cubs\nAfter birth, newborn lion cubs are born blind, have spotted coats and weigh between 1 to 2 kgs. After a few weeks of growth, the cubs will develop their sight and mobility, and the spotty appearance of their coat will fade.\nOnly about 1 in 4 lion cubs will survive to adulthood. Cubs are defenseless against predators and cannot hunt for themselves. The mother will take care of the cub, protecting it, hunting for it, preparing and teaching it to hunt and so on.\nAt around 11 months, lion cubs will begin hunting on their own.\nGrowing Up\nAt around the 2 to 3 month mark, lion cubs will weigh about 3 to 4 kgs and will usually have all of their teeth.\nAs they grow up, the mother lion will move her cubs to a new den several times a month. This is done to avoid predators and keep the cubs out of the way of danger.\nThe lioness generally won\u2019t rejoin the pride until the cubs are around 6 to 8 weeks old. This gives the cubs the change to grow large enough to avoid being dominated by other pride members.\nOnce the male lions reach adulthood, they will be banished from the pride and will be tasked with seeking out prides of their own.\nOur Favourite Lion Documentaries\nWe could watch wildlife docusmnetaries all day!

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lions: Facts, behavior and news | Live Science", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/27404-lion-facts.html", "text": "Lions once roamed Africa, Asia and Europe, but are now only found in parts of Africa and India.\nLions are the second-largest cats in the world, after tigers . Known as the \"king of beasts\" or \"king of the jungle,\" these regal felines once roamed Africa, Asia and Europe, but now only live in parts of Africa and India.\nExperts have long recognized two subspecies of lion, Panthera leo leo (the African lion) and Panthera leo persica (the Asiatic lion). However, recent studies suggest that lions from West and Central Africa are more closely related to Asian lions than they are to lions from the eastern and southern parts of Africa, according to the Cat Specialist Group (opens in new tab), a component of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nIn 2017, the Cat Specialist Group published their reclassification of lions (opens in new tab), grouping the cats into two new subspecies: Panthera leo leo (also called the Northern subspecies) and Panthera leo melanochaita (the Southern subspecies).\nPanthera leo leo includes lion populations in Central Africa, West Africa (West African or Senegal lion) and India (Asiatic lion), according to the University of Kent (opens in new tab), as well as extinct populations previously found in North Africa (Barbary lion), southeastern Europe, the Middle East, the Arabian peninsula and southwestern Asia. Panthera leo melanochaita includes lion populations from southern parts of Africa (Katanga lion and the Southeast African lion) and East Africa (Masai lion and Ethiopian lion).\nAlthough the West African and Asiatic lions are genetically similar, many of their physical characteristics and behaviors are slightly different.\nHow big are lions?\nAfrican lions can grow to measure between 9 and 10 feet long (3 meters) from head to tail, with the tail being about 2 to 3 feet long (60 to 91 centimeters), according to the Smithsonian National Zoo (opens in new tab). They typically weigh between 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms), with males reaching the higher end of that range.\nAsiatic lions (also called Asian or Indian lions) are slightly smaller than African lions. They are 6.6 to 9.2 feet (2 to 2.8 m) long from head to tail and weigh between 242 to 418 pounds (110 to 190 kg), according to the World Wildlife Fund (opens in new tab) (WWF).\nLions tend to have loose skin hanging from their midsection, possibly to help protect them from the piercing hooves of their frantic prey. Asiatic lions also have a fold of skin that runs along their belly, a feature rarely seen in African lions, according to the African Lion and Environmental Research Trust (opens in new tab) (ALERT), a research and conservation organization. Compared with African lions, Asiatic lions tend to have shaggier coats, longer hair tufts on their elbows, and a longer tassel on the end of their tail.\nNot only are male lions generally larger than females, but they also have a distinctive thick mane of hair around their heads that females lack. The biggest and most fabulous manes are more impressive to sexually mature females and more intimidating to competing males, according to the San Diego Zoo (opens in new tab). The mane also protects the male's neck during fights over territory or mating access. African lions tend to have bigger, more magnificent manes compared to their Asiatic cousins.\nCecil, a famous male lion, and his pride in Hwange National Park in November 2012.

Male lions defend the pride\u2019s territory, which may include an area of up to 100 square miles (259 square kilometers) of shrubs, grasslands and open woodlands, according to the Cincinnati Zoo (opens in new tab)in Ohio.\nAsiatic lions are found only in the Indian state of Gujarat in Western India, where most reside in the protected Sasan Gir National Park (opens in new tab), a 545-square-mile (1,412-square-km) wildlife haven. The Indian government designated this land, which includes a deciduous forest, grasslands, scrub jungle and rocky hills, as a wildlife sanctuary in 1965, according to the park's website. In addition to more than 500 lions and 300 leopards, the park is home to deer, antelope, jackal, hyenas, foxes, reptiles and more than 200 species of birds.\nLion pride dynamics\nLions are social cats and live in groups called prides. Asiatic and African lion prides are very different, though.\nAfrican lion prides typically consist of up to three adult males and around a dozen females and their young, according to the Sedgwick County Zoo (opens in new tab) in Wichita, Kansas. Some prides can grow to be extremely large, however, with up to 40 members. Females tend to remain in the pride in which they are born, so they are usually related to each other. Males, on the other hand, wander off to create their own prides when they are old enough.\nAsiatic male lions normally won't live with the females of their pride unless they\u2019re mating or are sharing a large kill, according to the Zoological Society of London (opens in new tab).\nImage 1 of 5 African male lions compete with other males to take control of a pride of females.

(Image credit: Jez Bennet/Shutterstock ) Image 1 of 5 Lions are the only truly social cats. (Image credit: Martin Prochazkacz/Shutterstock ) Image 1 of 5\nHow do lions hunt?\nAfrican lions tend to hunt large animals such as antelopes, zebras, hogs, rhinos , hippos and wildebeest. Asiatic lions also hunt large animals, including buffaloes, goats, nilgai (a large Asian antelope), chital and sambar (two types of deer). Lions can kill animals that weigh up to 1,000 pounds (450 kg), according to the Smithsonian National Zoo (opens in new tab), but they will also hunt smaller animals like mice and birds when opportunities arise.\nFemales are the main hunters of the pride, and work cooperatively in hunting parties to surround and take down prey. Lions can run up to 50 mph (80 km/h) for short distances and leap as far as 36 feet (11 m), almost the length of a school bus, according to the World Wildlife Fund (opens in new tab). To bring down prey, lions jump on the backs of very large animals but will \"ankle-tap\" smaller animals, meaning they reach out a paw and swipe the preys' legs to trip them up, according to ALERT (opens in new tab). To kill their prey, lions use their powerful jaws to snap the animal's neck or to strangle it to death.\nVery occasionally, males will join in the hunting action, particularly if the prey is extremely large, like an elephant or water buffalo. Otherwise, the main job of the male is to protect the pride, while the female lions hunt in packs. African males who live alone are required to hunt by themselves, and tend to hide in dense vegetation to engage in ambush-style hunting, according to Smithsonian Magazine (opens in new tab).\nLions typically hunt at night and often lurk around water holes, streams and rivers, as those areas are hotspots for prey. Lions will also scavenge, and won't hesitate to steal other predators' kills or eat the leftovers, according to ALERT.\nMating and raising young\nMale lions reach sexual maturity when they are around 2 years old, according to a research article published in 2018 in the journal Zoo Biology (opens in new tab). However, male lions are unlikely to breed before the age of 4 or 5 years, when they are large enough to attempt to take over a pride and assert their access to sexually mature females, according to ALERT (opens in new tab).\nMales as old as 16 years can still produce viable sperm but usually lose their mating rights once they can no longer fight off younger males. Male African lions that are trying to take over a pride will kill all of the cubs from other males to avoid competition.\nMost female lions give birth by the time they are 4 years old. The gestation period for lions is around four months. Females will give birth to their young away from others, and will hide the cubs for the first six weeks of their lives. At birth, the cubs only weigh around 2 to 4 pounds. (0.9 to 1.8 kg), according to ALERT (opens in new tab) , and they're completely dependent on their mother.\nAll of the females in a pride will mate at around the same time. After the first six weeks of rearing cubs alone, the mothers and cubs will rejoin the pride. Other females in the pride will contribute to raising all of their pride's young, and will even nurse other mothers' cubs, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nA mother lion will rear her cubs alone for the first six weeks of their lives, before rejoining her pride and getting help caring for her young from other adult females. (Image credit: Theodore Mattas/Shutterstock)\n(opens in new tab)\nConservation status\nLions are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species (opens in new tab). About 75% of African lion populations are in decline; their current global population is estimated at 20,000 in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund (opens in new tab) (WWF). The population has been reduced by nearly 50% over the past two decades because of retaliatory killings by farmers whose livestock were eaten by lions, as well as from trophy hunting and habitat loss.\nNews about lions\nResearch published in Nov. 2021 in the journal Molecular Ecology (opens in new tab) found that lions' ancestors inhabited North America by crossing the Bering Land Bridge, which once linked North America and northeast Asia, in multiple waves, alongside brown bears.\nIn March 2022, scientists who studied the movement patterns of lions over diverse landscapes, discovered that the big cats' hunting behaviors varied significantly due to changes in vulnerability and distribution of the lions' prey.\nThe research, which was published in the Journal of Mammalogy (opens in new tab), studied three lion prides in Kruger National Park in South Africa, evaluating their hunting behavior around large herbivores.\nAccording to the study authors, lions left their home ranges to hunt on 13% of the nights when they were observed. Their results indicated that the lions left their home ranges as often as every second night to visit areas with shorter grass, where wildebeests grazed.\nAdditional resources\nTo learn more about how wild lions can be protected, and the struggle to conserve lions, visit the Defenders of Wildlife website (opens in new tab).

For us, nothing captures the essence of Africa more so than the symbol of the lion. To celebrate World Lion Day, whichs occurs every year on August 10th, we wanted to share 12 interesting facts about lions. Read on for more amazing lion facts.\nReady for some Amazing Lion Facts?\nLions are one of Africa\u2019s most recognizable animals and for good reason: more than any other animal in the African wilderness, lions signify courage, strength, and power. Spending up to 20 hours of the day sleeping or resting, lions are the laziest of the big cats. They can be found lying on their backs with their feet up or taking a snooze in the shade. While lazing around, they are very affectionate towards one another, rubbing heads, grooming, and purring.\nAt Lion World Travel nothing represents the essence of Africa more so than the lion which is at the center of our brand and the nickname for our mascot \u201cLionel\u201d. He embodies playfulness as can be seen in our logo \u2013 Lionel\u2019s tongue is dangling lazily out of his mouth.\nHere are some amazing lion facts:\n1) Lions Are Social\nLions are the most sociable of all the big cats. They live in groups called prides, which usually consist of related females and their offspring. The typical pride consists of ten to fifteen lions, with several adult females, their cubs and up to four males. Some lion prides can be as large as 40 members!\n2) Lions Don't Need to Drink Everyday, But They Do Need to Eat\nLions can go up to four days without drinking water, but if available, they will drink water every day. Lions do need to eat every day. Adult female lions need to eat about 11 pounds of meat each day, while adult males eat 16 pounds or more every day. While lions primarily prey on large herbivores such as zebra, wildebeest, and buffalo, they have been known to prey on smaller animals like mice, birds, hares, lizards, and tortoises.\n3) Female Lions (Lionesses) Do Most of the Hunting\nLionesses are the primary hunters of the pride. They are smaller and more agile than males and they use teamwork to bring an animal down. After a successful hunt, all the lions in the pride share the meal. But there is a pecking order, with the adult males eating first, followed by the lionesses and finally the cubs. The males protect both the pride and the pride\u2019s territory (which can extend up to 100 square miles) from competing prides and other predators. Anywhere from 85-90% of the hunting is done by the females in a given pride.\n4) Lions Are Superb Hunters\nLions hunt by ambush. Fanning out, they form a semicircle, with the smaller lionesses herding the prey towards the center. A lion\u2019s vision is roughly six times more sensitive to light than humans, giving them a distinct advantage when hunting at night. Lion\u2019s claws are retractable, reaching up to 1 \u00bd inches in length, allowing for the tremendous control when it needs to go in for a kill. Lions can also reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour in short bursts and can jump up to 36 feet. So, it is easy to see why the lion is referred to as the \u201cking of the jungle\u201d, which leads us to our next fact...\n5) Lions Do Not Live in Jungles\nAlthough lions are known as the \"king of the jungle\", lions in Africa do not actually live in a jungle. Instead, their primary habitats consist of Africa\u2019s grasslands and plains. Three of the five largest lion populations are found in the wide-open savannas of Tanzania.\n6) Lions Communicate in Many Ways\nLions communicate in different ways using sounds like roars, growls, moans, and grunts. Also, by leaving scent markings and through visual signals, such as the darkness of the mane. They also rub their heads on one another as an act of bonding and to spread the \"family scent\". A lion's roar can be heard up to 5 miles away. This is a warning to other predators and to protect their territory from competing males, also to attract mating partners.\n7) Female Lions Raise Cubs Together\nFemales in the same pride tend to give birth around the same time, which allows multiple litters to be raised together. Lionesses will take care of their cubs until they reach the age of two or three. The mother then goes through estrus (heat cycle) and carries another litter. This is when the pride forces the male lion cubs and some of the female lion cubs out. They must now fend for themselves or find another pride. Male lions do not directly participate in the parenting, but they will protect the pride's cubs from danger. Did you know that lion cubs have two other names? Though they are usually referred to as cubs, lion babies have two other names: \"whelps\" and \"lionets\".\n8) More Lion Cub Facts\nWhen they are born, cubs are very small, and their eyes are closed until they are two to three weeks old. Even then, they cannot see properly for another few weeks. This is when they are vulnerable to attack from large birds, snakes and even male lions. A lioness will keep her cubs hidden from other lions for around six weeks until they are old enough to follow the pride. Lion cubs are full of life and grow up playing with the other youngsters in the pride. They can be seen leaping, rolling, and gently biting. This type of play builds strength and family bonds.\n9) Lions Are the Second Largest Cat on Earth\nOnly slightly smaller than the Siberian tiger, the lion is the second largest big cat, with a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. Unlike all other big cats that are solitary hunters, lions are social animals and live together in prides. Male lions can grow up to 10 feet in length and weigh up to 550 pounds, while female lions can grow to a length of 9 feet and weigh up to 390 pounds.\nVideo of a Majestic, Big Male Lion Walking, by African Anthology\n10) Lions Once Existed in Europe\nTo see lions in great numbers today, you must take a safari to eastern or southern Africa. But fossils and historical records show that lions once roamed across Egypt and northern Africa. Lions were also once found in Europe across most of Greece, Bulgaria and their neighboring countries. From Africa, across the Middle East and into Asia, lions once existed in the wild in many other countries including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Today, the only country outside of Africa that has wild lions is India, with a very small population surviving in and around the Gir National Park.\n11) Lions Can Climb Trees (If They Have To)\nMost lions spend all their time on the ground, but in some parks across Africa they have learned to climb trees. Compared to leopards, they are not very graceful at climbing trees as they are not adapted for climbing. Most prides of lions do not climb trees, and big males are less likely to climb a tree because they are so heavy. The reason why lions climb or sleep in trees is to get away from pesky biting flies and insects on the ground. It can be cooler up in a tree, and they have a higher vantage point to see if any other animals are nearby. Lions may also be forced to climb a tree temporarily to try to escape from an angered herd of buffaloes. These special tree-climbing lions are most popular in Tanzania and Uganda. Queen Elizabeth National Park, Lake Manyara National Park, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Tarangire National Park are the best places to possibly see them. With that said, some lucky visitors to the Serengeti have seen lions in trees too.\n12) Lions Are Under Threat\nThree-quarters of African lion populations are in decline. With only around 20,000 in the wild, they are officially considered vulnerable of extinction. Even though they are powerful and majestic, and have no natural predators, it is inconceivable that African lion numbers have fallen by over 40% in the last 30 years. The main threats to lions are loss of territory, lion/human conflict, and trophy hunting. As a traveler, you can do your part by traveling to national parks and game reserves that put resources toward protecting Africa's lions.\nBy booking with Lion World Travel, you can be sure that you are helping to support lion conservation in Africa.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Mountain Lion images!\n\u201cCan jump to the height of a two-story building!\u201d\nThe mountain lion is a large, tan colored cat species native to North America, Central America and South America. In the United States, these cats live primarily in western states and Florida. Also called by the name cougar, puma, catamount and panther, mountain lions are animals that thrive in many habitats. They live in more geographies than any other Western Hemisphere mammal, besides humans.\nMountain Lion Top Facts\nCry like house cats: Mountain lions do not roar, instead using a distinct mountain lion scream, growl, hiss, meow and purr\nChanging eye color: Cubs are born with blue eyes that change to yellow by age 16 months\nSolitary life: These lions prefer to live alone on about 30 square miles of territory\nFast runners: They can run at speeds up to 50 miles per hour\nWant more mountain lion facts? Give \u201811 Incredible Mountain Lion Facts\u2018 a read for a deep dive into the most incredible facts about these majestic animals!\nMountain Lion Scientific Name\nThe mountain lion\u2019s scientific name is Puma concolor, from the Spanish word puma of Latin origin. The name translates to mean \u201cmountain lion\u201d in Spanish, French, German and other Latin-based languages. The big cat\u2019s phylum is Chordata, in the class Mammalia, order Carnivora, family Felidae and genus Puma. Early Spanish explorers of the Americas called the cat \u201cleon,\u201d meaning lion and \u201cgato monte, meaning mountain cat. Incas called it \u201cpuma,\u201d while early South American Indians called it \u201ccuguacuarana,\u201d from which the word \u201ccougar\u201d comes. Most scientists prefer to call these cats \u201cpumas.\u201d These cats have about 40 names in the English language, including panther, puma, cougar, catamount, painter, mountain screamer, red tiger, Mexican lion and American lion. Six subspecies live in North America, Central American, eastern South America, northern South America, central South America and southern South America.\nMountain Lion Appearance & Behavior\nThese predators look very much like over-sized short-hair house cats. They have small heads with short faces. Ears are rounded and small. Their bodies are long and sleek, with long necks and tails. Puma legs are powerful, suited to rapid increase of speed and made for pouncing. The cats\u2019 teeth seize their prey, tearing and slashing the meat.\nThe average mountain lion is an animal that ranges from about 3\u20193\u2033 in length to about 5\u20195\u2033. But with their tails, some males measure as long as nine feet and females up to seven feet. The cats stand between two feet and 2\u20196\u2033 from the ground to their shoulders. In adulthood, females weigh from 80 to 100 pounds and males from 125 to 160 pounds. Mountain lion color in the United States is most commonly tan. Throughout the Americas, their color ranges from a tawny color to a bluish gray. Their bellies, inner legs and throats are always lighter in color, with their noses and tails having black or dark edges. Babies are born with spots to camouflage them in the wild. These spots fade at about six months. Their blue eyes also change to yellow by the age of 16 months.\nMountain lions are solitary by nature. They sometimes share territory with one other puma, but prefer a 30 square mile range to call their own. Some mountain lions maintain a territory of up to 125 square miles. They live in habitats of all kinds in the Western Hemisphere, from mountainous regions to the swamps of Florida. Humans rarely see mountain lions, as these animals prefer to remain hidden. But they are stealthy creatures that stalk their prey. Pumas are very intelligent. They avoid humans whenever possible.\nMountain lions are at the top of the food chain. They keep deer populations in balance and even help reduce the number of vehicle accidents involving deer. Although brown bears will kill and eat mountain lions, sometimes the lions win in fights against these giant bears. Humans and domestic animals must watch out for mountain lions, when we cross into their habitats. Puma avoid humans whenever possible. But people sometimes cross their paths on hiking trails or out in the wilderness.\nTo know how dangerous mountain lions are, read here.\nMountain Lion Habitat\nMountain lions live throughout the Americas, from the Yukon of Canada to the subtropics of South America. No other American mammal, except humans, spans such a wide land range. They can live in almost any type of habitat, such as mountains, wetlands, forests and deserts, also from sea-level areas to the highest snow-covered mountain peaks. Although they prefer 14 western states of the United States, puma in the U.S. are also found in low numbers in Florida. These cats also roam as far as the northeastern states from time-to-time. Mountain lions live in areas with dense shrubbery, undergrowth and other plant life for cover. If they feel threatened, they leave the area. The average lifespan for a wild mountain lion is about ten years. But in zoos, many live for 20 or more years. Because of sport hunting in some regions, the cats in those areas only live to about five years of age.\nThroughout their lifetime, mountain lions prefer to live alone. Only for mating and parenting do they break this rule. They mark their territory by urinating on piles of leaves, pine needles or grass and clawing trees. This tells other lions to stay away. If another lion crosses into the territory, the two will fight to their death if necessary. The cats\u2019 coat color varies from region to region. Where they live determines this color. With the ability to blend into their surroundings, mountain lions easily prey on deer and small mammals.\nThey eat coyotes, raccoons, rabbits and porcupine. To preserve their killed prey and protect it from scavengers, they bury it and return to feed off of it for several days. Mountain lions\u2019 large hind legs have greater muscle mass than their front legs. This enables them to jump up to 18 feet into a tree and 20 feet up or down a hill. They run very fast, with their flexible spine allowing them to change direction and move around obstacles quickly. Their large paws keep them steady, with sharp claws for defense and attacking prey. Keen eyesight helps them find their prey.\nPredators & Threats and Diet\nThe biggest threats to mountain lions are humans. These cats are apex predators, near the top of the food chain. They are sometimes killed by brown bear or as part of territory fights with other mountain lions. Mountain lions once lived from the east coast of America to the west coast. But people feared the big cats and believed them to be predators of livestock. So by the 1940s, many states paid bounties for killing of the lions. Each pelt once brought a reward of $25 to $35. This reduced their numbers by far, restricting the cat population mostly to the western coast and a small number in Florida. Despite laws in place to protect them in many parts of the U.S., some people still illegally trap, poison and shoot the lions on sight. Hunting is still legal in some form in many states, such as Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Washington and Oregon.\nMountain lions are carnivores that are apex predators across much of their environment. Their favorite meals include mule deer, badgers, raccoons, and other mammals. For a complete analysis of their diet, give our \u2018What Do Mountain Lions Eat? 20 Animals in Their Diet\u2018 page a read!\nMountain Lion Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nMountain lion females can mate with several males in one reproductive season, called estrus. Typically, the female prefers to mate with a male from an overlapping territory. The three to 10 days of a mating period is the only time humans see males and females together. Otherwise, they remain solitary animals and avoid contact. For both females and males, sexual maturity occurs at about one to 2.5 years old.\nFemales do not try to reproduce until they have established their own territory. Females with cubs move from one place on their territory to another every few weeks. This helps her protect the cubs from roaming males and other predators. Mating occurs throughout the year, when the female is in estrus. But most litters are born during the warm months of summer, particularly July to September. Females produce a litter every 1.5 to two years, on average. But if she loses a litter, she quickly enters estrus again. Gestation, also called pregnancy, for a mountain lion is about 90 days. Gestation for a mountain lion is short compared to other large land animals. But it compares closely to other lions and their tiny cousins, domestic house cats.\nHuman: 270 days\nBrown bear: 215 days\nGiraffe: 430 days\nAfrican lion: 110 days\nHouse cat: 58 to 67 days\nMountain lion: 90 days\nMost litters include two to three spotted, blue-eyed cubs, sometimes called kittens. Sometimes only one or as many as four are born. By six months of age, the fur has changed to a tawny, unspotted coat like adults. Their blue eyes change to yellow by the age of 16 months. Kittens nurse for three months. They start eating a meat at one and a half months, then eating meat exclusively after weaning. As they grow in their adult coats at six months, they start hunting with their mother. Babies are cared for by their mother until one to two years of age, when the cubs must strike out on their own. Where hunted, such as in U.S. states that permit some hunting of mountain lions, the average lifespan for one of these cats is about five years. Left to live a natural lifespan in the wild, most live about 13 years. The average lifetime for these big cats in zoos is about 19 years, although some live beyond 20.\nMountain Lion Population\nAs of 2015, the existing mountain lion population is listed as decreasing due to diminishing habitat, but stable. Overall, the species is not endangered. This is with a few exceptions, including the subspecies of Florida panthers and the now extinct eastern cougar. The eastern cougar was declared officially extinct in 2011 by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. In Florida, only 160 panthers remain. One of the biggest problems in mountain lion conservation is the lack of clear lion counts over the past decades. States and other countries are working now to establish clear counts, such as in California. But thousands of these cats are known to exist in the U.S., as well as throughout Central America, Canada and South America. In California, the Fish and Wildlife\u2019s Wildlife Investigations Laboratory has set a goal to know a precise statewide mountain lion count by 2022.\nView all 111 animals that start with M"}

Unlike other cats, lions live in packs and are mostly diurnal. They prey on medium to large sized ungulates.\nAnatomy and Appearance\nThe King of Animals? For many people, the lion is the most impressive cat. But in fact, it's not the biggest cat. This honor goes to the Siberian tiger. The lion is second largest.\nBehavior\nWhy Do Lions Roar?\n\"Look how strong I am!\" This is the main reason why lions roar. They want to make clear that they are the boss and that no other lion dares to enter the territory. Lions also roar to recognize each other. Actually, a lion\u2019s roar can be even heard from a distance of 2.9 miles (4.8 km).\nLions Hunt in Groups\nLions can run quite fast at speed of up to 37 mph (60 km/h) over short distances, but antelopes are much faster. They can cover large distances at 60 mph (90 km/h). So what should the lions do? They take advantage of moments of surprise while hunting. They sneak up to their prey from different directions until they are about 30 m away from their victim. During the attack, the prey cannot evade its enemies.\nMale Lions Are Only Guests\nLions live in packs. Yet, there is no place for males in the strong and social community of mum, granny, sister, aunts and cousins. The males are only guests to ensure the continued existence of the pack through reproduction. But this also has its benefits: Guests are usually being catered for. Male lions therefore hardly ever take part in hunting.\nWhat Is the Role of the Male Lion?\nIf the males do not hunt \u2013 what is their job? Enjoying a lazy day? This would be too simple. Male lions actually have very responsible tasks, such as to mark and secure the territory, and to protect the offspring while the ladies go hunting.\nLion Species\nAre There Asiatic Lions?\nYes, there are Asiatic lions, too. They look like their African relatives but their appeearance is slightly different. Their mane is shorter and more sparse. Unfortunately, Asiatic lions are are threatened with extinction. They survive only in a national park in India. There is a breeding program to save the species. The hope is that it can be reintroduced into the wild sometime in the future.\nWhite Lions\nLions usually have yellowish or light brown fur. There are also white lions, but they are very rare. Their coat color results from a rare mutation in their genes. However, they're not albinos. Albinos lack the color pigments and have red eyes. White lions typically have blue eyes.\nCan You Cross a Lion With a Tiger?\nYes, lions and tigers can have offspring. The cross between a male tiger and a female lion is called a tigon. If the male is a lion and the female a tiger, it's called a liger.\nReproduction\nLions give birth once a year. During the first 4-6 weeks the cubs stay in their hiding place, until they are strong enough to participate in the life of the pack. After three months, the young lions can follow their mother everywhere. After one year, the male lions start to grow their mane. This is when they have to leave the pack to find a new one.\nFun Facts\nStepping Into the Lion\u2019s Den\nWe use this idiomatic expression when we think, that we are entering a dangerous situation. It derives from the fable \"The Old Lion and the Fox\": In this story, an old and weak lion pretends to be ill and asks other animals to visit him in his den (because he is to weak to go out) - and eventually then eats them. The fox is the only one that sees though this cunning plan. On the ground, he notices the traces that only lead into the den.\nThe African Lion Is Related To:\nAnimals in the Same Biome:"}

These creatures spread across Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka in India. Because lion tailed macaques reproduce well during captivity, there are now 500 of them in zoos across the world. In contrast, the population range of howler monkeys is around 100,000 in the wild.\nWhere does a lion-tailed macaque live?\nLion tailed macaques live in tropical rainforests throughout the south of India. Only the Western Ghats mountains in India are known to make up the lion-tailed macaque habitat.\nWhat is a lion-tailed macaque's habitat?\nSemi-evergreen and evergreen rainforest, as well as monsoon forests, are home to Macaca silenus. Usually, the lion-tailed macaque is found alongside deciduous trees and can be observed at elevations of up to 4921.3 ft (1500 m). Southern pig-tailed macaques can be found in the Malay Peninsula's southern half forest, Sumatra, including Bangka Island. They prefer to inhabit thick rainforests.\nWho do lion-tailed macaques live with?\nLion-tailed macaques are diurnal and arboreal. They travel as a family group of 10-20 members or more than that. Although some groups contain up to three mature males, there is usually just one dominant male that is in charge of breeding.\nHow long does a lion-tailed macaque live?\nIn captivity, the Macaca silenus can live up to 38 years, while it is more common for them to live to be around 30 years old. The expected maximum life expectancy in the wild is around 20 years.\nHow do they reproduce?\nFertile females have a visible bulge underneath their tails. Males will know it's time to mate when they see this. There is no specific breeding season and for most of the time, lion-tailed macaques breed with each other. In February-March, the majority of babies are born.\nMales reach sexual maturity at the age of eight, while females attain sexual maturity only at age of four. Females spend their entire lives in the natal group. Young males form bachelorette groups and then attempt to take over established groups.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), an inhabitant of the Western Ghats, has been declared an Endangered species.\nLion-Tailed Macaque Fun Facts\nWhat do lion-tailed macaques look like?\nBlack fur covers the entire body. The tail is thin, long, naked, and also has a black crest at the tip, comparable to that of a lion's tail, albeit the lion's tail is more prominent in males than females. The face is completely bare and dark. The cheek pouches of lion-tailed macaques emerge beside the bottom jaw and radiate outwards the side of the neck. After two months of age, the delicate, black pelage on offsprings is supplanted by adult pelage.\nHow cute are they?\nThey are not very cute animals. They are very fearsome creatures and should be stayed away from.\nHow do they communicate?\nMales macaques have been the only macaques that use vocalizations to announce territorial boundaries. Male macaques are highly territorial, and they usually deliver a loud call to let intruding groups know they've arrived. When two groups meet, one usually flees without displaying any overt aggressiveness. Their tail also plays an important role in their communication. Animals who are higher in the ranking have its tail up straight, while animals that are below in the hierarchy and fearful have tails pointing down.\nHow big is a lion-tailed macaque?\nThe average length of lion tailed macaques is 15.75-24.02 in (40-61 cm). While the Japanese macaque is 32.67 in (82.98 cm) long. Thus the lion-tailed macaque is smaller than the Japanese macaque.\nHow fast can a lion-tailed macaque move?\nThe traveling speed of these wild creatures is unknown due to a lack of investigation.\nHow much does a lion-tailed macaque weigh?\nLion-tailed macaque males weigh between 11.02-22.04 lb (4.99-9.99 kg), while females weigh just 6.61-13.2 lb ( 2.99-5.98 kg).\nWhat are the male and female names of the species?\nThe male and female lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) have no distinct names.\nWhat would you call a baby lion-tailed macaque?\nKids of lion-tailed macaques do not have any particular name. They can be referred to as infants.\nWhat do they eat?\nAlthough lion-tailed macaques are omnivores, they eat mostly fruit. They eat a wide range of vegetation as their food, including leaves, flowers, stems, fungi, and buds, among other things. The lion-tailed macaque diet also includes insects, tree frogs, lizards, and smaller animals on occasion. Because they are afraid of predators, lion tailed macaques tend to forage fast in the forest. In times of peril, their cheek pouches allow them to rapidly gather massive amounts of food. When completely expanded, the cheek pouches can hold the same amount of food as their stomach!\nAre they dangerous?\nThese species typically elude humans if possible. Agricultural farms including orchards may be attacked by these macaques.\nWould they make a good pet?\nLion-tailed macaques have become an endangered species, their habitat only being in the Western Ghats of Southern India, where they live in the evergreen forest. To keep a species that thrives in such a diverse ecosystem, the confined environment should be equally diverse. It's challenging to keep such a large pet at home in a suitable environment.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nThis macaque has black hair. Its most distinguishing feature is a silver-white mane that wraps around the head from the cheeks to the chin, earning it the name 'beard ape.' The hairless forehead has a dark complexion.\nWhy is the lion-tailed macaque endangered?\nThe spectacular lion-tailed macaque is an Old World monkey with a lion-like tail that is lengthy, slender, and curled. Unfortunately, this cute primate is one of the most endangered macaques on the planet. Meanwhile, this primate is among the world's tiniest macaque species.\nHabitat loss is a problem for lion-tailed macaques due to timber harvesting, firewood, and other forestry products destined for human consumption. They are also prone to inbreeding because of low numbers in the environment and the separation of different units in small forest patches.\nStopping development into lion-tailed macaques areas, as well as poaching, electrocution, and road-kills are all part of government strategy.\nWhy are lion-tailed macaques important?\nLion-tailed macaques are expected to have a role in seed distribution due to their frugivory and ability to bring fruits in their enormous cheek pouches. Lion-tailed macaques, as prey species, may have a favorable impact on the population of their predators.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Cape Lion images!\n\u201cRecognizable by its black-maned appearance, the Cape lion was once native to Africa\u2019s southern Cape region.\u201d\nThis wild cat is a member of the subspecies Panthera leo melanochaita. For centuries, it lived in relative peace and isolation on the South African plains. Following the arrival of European settlers, however, it endured decades of constant hunting and harassment, causing numbers to dwindle. The conservation status of this lion is considered to be functionally extinct in the wild since 1858 (though scattered individuals were found up to a few decades later).\nA Subspecies That Has Been the Subject of Debate\nThe taxonomy of the Cape lion (as well as other lion populations) has been the subject of much-extended controversy. For centuries, the Cape lion was considered to be its own distinctive subspecies of lions. But then a genetic analysis in 2017 revealed that the Cape lion may not be quite as distinct as once thought. Genetically, it is almost completely similar to other lion populations of southern and eastern Africa. This suggests there may have been significant interbreeding between the populations that prevented them from developing independently of each other. All lions in the southern and eastern regions of Africa are now considered to be part of the same subspecies.\nAnother source of dispute is whether these lions still exist in captivity somewhere. In 2000, a South African zoo director named John Spence claimed that, after a careful search, he had identified possible descendants of Cape lion specimens still living in Russia\u2019s Novosibirsk Zoo, which might have been taken from South Africa and interbred with other types of lions. However, before he had could perform a DNA analysis (with the intention to breed back the Cape lion into existence), Spence died in 2010, and no one else took up the cause.\n4 Incredible Cape Lion Facts!\nBased on genetic analysis, it\u2019s thought that the Cape lion first evolved in the Late Pleistocene, around 500,000 years ago.\nOne of the most interesting facts is that the lion can interbreed with both a tiger and a leopard. The offspring of a male lion and tigress is called a liger. If the offspring is the result of a tiger and lioness, then it\u2019s called a tigon. The result of a leopard and lioness is called a leopon.\nThe lion represents strength and nobility in many African cultures. It features prominently in ancient stories and proverbs.\nPreserved Cape lion specimens are kept at several museums around the world, including the Swedish Museum of National History, the Paris Museum of Natural History, and the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History.\nScientific Name\nThe scientific name for the Cape lion is Panthera leo melanochaitus. Melan (or melas) means black in Greek and may be a reference to the lion\u2019s black-maned appearance. Since the Cape lion is no longer considered to be its own separate subspecies, the other members of melanochaitus are still alive in parts of southern and eastern Africa, though dwindling in number. The lion in general is part of the same genus as the leopard, tiger, and jaguar. The species name Leo is the Latin name for the lion.\nAppearance\nThe Cape lion has all the physical attributes of a lion, including a big head, muscular body, yellowish tawny coat, white stomach, and a long tail with a black tuft at the end. The biggest distinguishing feature is the darker color of the male\u2019s mane, which extended along the shoulders and below the stomach. This subspecies appears to have been particularly large for a lion, with some specimens weighing nearly 600 pounds and measuring around seven feet long. Males tend to be larger than females by about 100 pounds and, of course, grow a large mane of hair around the neck.\nBehavior\nWhile the Cape lion was driven to extinction before it could be fully studied, we can infer some facts about its behavior by observing other members of the same species. The lion is the only member of the cat family that exhibits highly social behavior. The basis of this society is the pride. With potentially up to 40 distinct members, the pride consists of several generations of lionesses, a small number of breeding males, and the cubs. Members may break up into smaller groups during the day and only come together to hunt and eat.\nA single pride may occupy the same territory for multiple generations. When prey is particularly abundant, the total territory can reach up to eight square miles, but when sparse, it can stretch up to 150 square miles. Lions mark their territory by urinating, defecating, and rubbing up against vegetation with their scent glands.\nEach member of the pride is thought to adopt a general role. Males are more likely to guard the territory against potential rival prides. Mothers form their own separate mini-group and nurse each other\u2019s cubs. They give nursing priority to their own cubs, followed by the offspring of closely related lions. Both males and females can take part in the group hunt. While scientists still debate why lions are the only wild cats to form groups, larger prides do appear to confer greater reproductive success in the wild.\nThe typical lion spends around 22 hours per day resting. Only two or three hours are spent hunting; perhaps more if the prey is particularly difficult to find. They communicate with each other through several sophisticated methods of smell, sound, and body movements. Head nuzzling appears to be a form of greeting while licking and grooming help to facilitate social bonding. The lion can make a kind of grimace, with an open mouth, bared teeth, wrinkled nose, and closed eyes, in response to sniffing chemical signals. Roaring is commonly done in the evening before a hunt and again at dawn to advertise its presence. The sound can be heard from more than three miles all around it.\nHabitat\nThe Cape lion once roamed the plains of South Africa. It was particularly prominent around the semi-desert Karoo plains within the interior of the country, just south of the Orange River, which runs along the border of Namibia and close to the Kalahari Desert. The other members of the melanochaita subspecies live as far north as Kenya.\nPredators and Threats\nThe Cape lion was driven to extinction by the twin threats of hunting and habitat loss by European settlers. It\u2019s not clear if the lion was under threat before the colonization of South Africa, but lion numbers have been falling almost everywhere around the globe for many thousands of years. Hunting may have been done both for sport and to prevent the lion from killing livestock. They were shot in greater numbers than any other population of African lions.\nWhat eats the Cape lion?\nAn adult Cape lion had no natural predators in its native habitat, but the cubs were occasionally killed by larger predators such as hyenas, leopards, and jackals.\nWhat does the Cape lion eat?\nThe Cape lion was considered to be an apex predator and an important keystone animal in its natural habitat. Its diet largely consisted of hoofed animals such as wildebeests, antelopes, and zebras. If an opportunity arose, then it could also hunt Cape buffalo, rodents, and juvenile or injured elephants and hippos. Lions hunt by stalking their prey from cover and then lunging at its neck. The victim usually dies from strangulation shortly afterward.\nIf the lions have to pursue their prey over long distances, then they will usually tire out easily. This caused most hunts to end prematurely in failure. A single lion could consume around 75 pounds in a single meal. Pride mates would squabble over meals, but the successful hunters responsible for the kill would usually receive first dibs. After resting for a week, the lions would resume the hunt once again.\nReproduction and Life Cycle\nCape lions had no established reproductive season; they could mate at almost any time of the year. Both male and female lions were polygamous, meaning they had multiple sexual partners over the course of a lifetime. A female will almost always mate with another member of its own pride. Once a pair has bonded, it could copulate up to 50 times per day. The frequency of their mating is intended to stimulate fertilization and also ensure that no other male can copulate with the female (which also had the added benefit of guaranteeing the male\u2019s paternity).\nAfter a gestation period of more than a hundred days, the female would give birth to no more than six cubs at a time. Born blind and helpless, the cubs were covered in a thick coat and dark spots. They were fully weaned by the age of six or seven months and learned to hunt by around 11 months old. It took around two years before they could become functionally independent, however.\nUntil that time, the mortality rates of lions were exceptionally high. They face numerous threats from hungry predators, the harsh landscape, and adult males that take over a pride and kill the previous offspring. The group of mothers will attempt to defend their cubs from this infanticide for as long as possible.\nMale cubs are expelled from the pride upon reaching sexual maturity at the age of three or four; they wander alone until they\u2019re old and strong enough to take a pride of their own. Females often remain with the pride even beyond the age of sexual maturity, but they too can be expelled if there\u2019s no room in the pride. Lions can sometimes live more than 25 years in captivity, but their expected lifespan is generally shortened to around 10 years in the wild because of hunting, starvation, and early childhood mortality.\nPopulation\nThe Cape lion\u2019s conservation status is extinct. No confirmed specimens are remaining anywhere in the world.\nView all 152 animals that start with C"}

Further, it belongs to the order of primates and the family Callitrichidae.\nHow many golden lion tamarins are there in the world?\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), there is 1,400 mature golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia). There are about 1,107 golden lion tamarins in the largest subpopulation. The golden lion tamarin conservation status improved from Critically Endangered to Endangered due to conservation efforts. However, this population is constantly threatened due to rampant habitat loss.\nWhere does a golden lion tamarin live?\nThe golden lion tamarins live in moist and humid tropical and subtropical rainforests. Rio de Janeiro and other coastal areas of Brazil, which are the native golden lion tamarin habitats experience about 59 in (1,500 mm) average rainfall every year. These native forests abound in many plant species like vines, epiphytes, and so on.\nAs part of conservation efforts, golden lion tamarins are also kept in zoos. The groups brought up in zoos are released in the natural habitat as part of the re-introduction efforts to boost the wild population.\nWhat is a golden lion tamarin's habitat?\nWhen it comes to habitat, the golden lion tamarins reside in the lowland seasonal rainforest near the Atlantic coast in southeastern Brazil. These rainforests are seasonal with the summers being hot and humid and winters being dry and cool.\nThe highly adaptable nature of golden lion tamarins gives them the ability to survive in secondary and degraded forests as well. As long as the golden lion tamarin habitat has a year-round food supply, the golden lion can adjust itself.\nWho do golden lion tamarins live with?\nThe small golden lion is a highly social primate species. The wild population lives in extended family groups with four to eight individuals. The family unit will consist of the main breeding pair, baby golden lion tamarin monkey, and other extended members.\nThe most common golden lion tamarin behavior is grooming, which helps strengthen the bond between the family group. You will also find golden lion tamarins playing and jumping from one tree to another.\nEven though golden lion tamarins are social, they are also very territorial. One family group can have a territory ranging from 98.8-247.1 acres (40-100 ha). According to a study, two factors: predation and reproductive requirements play a critical role in determining the home range for golden lion tamarins. When an intruder is spotted, the golden lion group will behave aggressively. The golden males and females will start baring their teeth and making high-pitched shrieks. This behavior is also exhibited by the family groups to project excitement or fear. Territory fights between males can also lead to death.\nHow long does a golden lion tamarin live?\nThe golden lion tamarin lifespan ranges between 8-20 years. It is possible for the Endangered species to survive 20 years when the individuals are in the care of humans. However, the first year of the golden lion tamarins is the harshest. It is estimated that 50% of babies do not survive the first year.\nHow do they reproduce?\nGolden lion tamarin families tend to have one dominant female who mates with the golden male. Females achieve sexual maturity by 18 months and for males, it takes two years. The females can reproduce once or twice yearly. September to November and January to March are the two breeding periods. The gestation period is about five months, after which the golden lion females will give birth to twins. After birth, the litter is taken care of by both males and females in the group. The golden lion babies are primarily raised and nurtured by adult males. Females only nurse the babies. Five weeks after the birth of twins, the golden lion tamarins will start exploring and will be weaned by three months.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, golden lion tamarins are an Endangered species. Constant conservation initiatives resulted in the golden lion tamarins whose scientific name is Leontopithecus rosalia to move from Critically Endangered into Endangered in 2003. However, the wild population of this species faces serious threats due to habitat loss. The golden lion tamarin Endangered status is also due to fragmentation of the primary forest due to residential and commercial development, development of transport corridors, and agriculture.\nScientists believe that at least 2,000 individuals of this tamarin species need to live in the forest to come out of the Red List of Threatened Species by 2025. While there have been quite a few initiatives taken to increase the number of the species, the efforts need to be ramped up before the species population reaches a point of no return.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Fun Facts\nWhat do golden lion tamarins look like?\nThe golden lion tamarin is an attractive primate species found in Brazil. To assist in their movement, the primates have long fingers and claws. These golden lion tamarin adaptations help them to hold and jump from one tree branch to another. But it is their bright and thick red and orange mane that makes this wild species stand out. Both males and females will have this shaggy mane, so do not differ in size or looks. The color of this primate's tail can be black, brown, and orange. The face is devoid of hair and black in color. The soles of the primates are leathery in texture and again black in color.\nHow cute are they?\nYes, these primates look very cute because of their shaggy orange appearance. This is especially true for young individuals. Their size also contributes to this cute image.\nHow do they communicate?\nWhen golden lion tamarins spot predators or intruders in their habitat, they communicate by shrieking loudly. The shrieks alert the groups of the presence of golden lion tamarin predators. They have different vocalizations for different types of predators. Open mouths, staring and stretched bodies are the behavior exhibited by the species to show aggression and fear.\nHow big is a golden lion tamarin?\nSize-wise, this is the largest primate among other tamarins and marmosets like the pygmy marmoset. However, when compared to other primates, this group is small. The golden lion tamarins have a body size that is around 8-13 in (20.3-33 cm) while its tail is about 12-15 in (30.5-38.1 cm) in length.\nHow fast can a golden lion tamarin run?\nGolden lion tamarins have some adaptations like long fingers and claws that allow them to move and run quadrupedally |(using all four limbs). It is estimated that they run at 24 mph (38.6 kph).\nHow much does a golden lion tamarin weigh?\nThe golden lion tamarin is a small primate species. This wild animal weighs around 19.4-24.5 oz (550-700 g) making them lighter than even the macaque monkey and the squirrel monkey.\nWhat are the male and female names of the species?\nBoth male and female members of the golden tamarin groups are referred to in the same way.\nWhat would you call a baby golden lion tamarin?\nThere is no special name for a baby golden lion tamarin.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe golden lion tamarin diet includes a mix of fruits and insects like spiders and bugs. Research shows their diet includes some 60 plants. After eating the food, they disperse the fruit seeds, which help maintain the ecology of the habitat. Those breeding in captivity, consume a variety of food like carrots, green beans, mealworms, and hard-boiled eggs.\nFun fact, they use their special claws to remove insects and invertebrates hidden in the many cracks in a tree. Being social, the tamarins are open to sharing their food within their group, but not so with outsiders.\nAre they aggressive?\nYes, the golden lion tamarins exhibit aggression when they come across predators. They use scent to mark their range and shriek loudly to advertise and alert others of the presence of the predator or intruder. Fights between same-sex members can turn violent and in extreme cases lead to death.\nWould they make a good pet?\nNo, they won't. These wild animals should not be domesticated. Fun fact, in the 17th century, ladies in Europe used to keep golden lion tamarins as pets.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country.

These animals are social and playful in nature, often considered as the welcome party of Galapagos islands! The biggest distinction amongst this species of sea lions can be perceived in their size when compared with their other relatives. It is necessary to keep in mind that although social in nature, sea lions are wild animals, if they are not given the space and privacy they need, male sea lions can get a bit aggressive and bite people.\nWhat class of animal does a Galapagos sea lion belong to?\nThis species comes from the Otariidae family and is of the Mammalia class like other fur seals. This wild animal is one of the only six mammal species found along the Galapagos Islands.\nHow many Galapagos sea lions are there in the world?\nThe population of Galapagos sea lions around the world is approximately 50,000.\nWhere does a Galapagos sea lion live?\nSea lions are found at the Galapagos Islands and Isla de la Plata near the shores of Ecuador. When you arrive at this island, the first sight you see will be the sea lion Galapagos relaxing and playing with each other on the beach!\nWhat is a Galapagos sea lion's habitat?\nFound in the pacific ocean, Galapagos lions' habitat consists of marine or saltwater. They spend most of their time during the day going in the water to hunt and swim around and return to the higher level of the beach at night. They absolutely love sand.\nWho does the Galapagos sea lion live with?\nGalapagos sea lions often live together with around 30 other sea lions. On islands, they gather into harems which consists of females and one dominant male, or into bachelor colonies (which consists of males only). Unlike in bachelor colonies, the bull defends harems ensuring that other bulls don't come near. They often get into territorial fights. Defending often wears down the bull, and another dominant male might take over the harem.\nHow long does a Galapagos sea lion live?\nSea lions mature at the age of four to five years. The Galapagos sea lion's life span is 15-24 years. The average sea lion's age expectancy is 20 years.\nHow do they reproduce?\nThe mating season of Galapagos sea lions occurs usually from May to January. Female sea lion matures around five years, they are sexually receptive once a year. Whereas males may wait until they are older. Galapagos sea lions practice polygamy. After mating, the female sea lion carries a single pup for 11 months. The sea lion pups nurse on the mother (cow) for about a year, however after a week, the mother returns to hunt for food in the water continues nursing after. The cow and their pups recognize each other by their unique barks.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe Galapagos sea lion's Endangered status is one of the reasons why they are being heavily protected as there are only 50,000 of them. The El Nino event has proven to be a threat. On islands, it is ensured year-round that Galapagos sea lions are unbothered. Sea lions are at risk due to marine plastic pollution too. It has been observed that local dogs have been transmitting diseases to sea lion colonies.\nGalapagos Sea Lion Fun Facts\nWhat does the Galapagos sea lion look like?\nSea lions can be easily identified, male sea lions have dark grey fur and a bump on their head. They are four times larger than female sea lions. They have thick necks and shoulders. They have a fairly large chest as compared to females. Females on the other hand tend to have brownish fur. Female sea lions are characterized by long necks and wider upper bodies in comparison with the rest of their bodies. Their canines are not as strong as male sea lions. Female sea lions have flat heads. The sea lion pup has a chestnut brown body. Their flippers allow them to move around on land. You can also see them galloping around the shore.\nHow cute are they?\nGalapagos sea lions' presence is very warm and welcoming! Often the offspring can be found playing, napping with other pups. It is quite a sight to see! They are also very interactive and very tempting to play with. Their tiny snouts add to how endearing they are! They are much cuter than any other species of sea lion.\nHow do they communicate?\nGalapagos sea lions bark to communicate. Their barks are quite similar to dogs! They bark in long, repetitive sequences. Females don't exhibit similar behavior. However, their pups do growl. The mother can identify its pup's bark amongst 30 other sea lions! Male sea lions are aggressive and patrol their territories to ward off intruders. Often the dominant males will patrol beaches with female sea lions, as long as they keep other male sea lions at bay, they can mate with females.\nHow big is a Galapagos sea lion?\nGalapagos sea lions are huge! They can weigh up to 550 lb (250 kg). Galapagos sea lion size in matters of length falls in the range of five to nine in. Thus making them one of the largest animals found on these islands. They still happen to be four times smaller than an adult walrus.\nHow fast can a Galapagos sea lion swim?\nThese creatures swim really fast for short periods of time at 25 mph (40 kph), however they swim around on average at 11 mph (17 kph). The Galapagos sea lion adaptations of a smooth, streamlined body help them swim efficiently in the ocean. They can dive almost 1970 ft (600 m) and can stay underwater for ten minutes.\nHow much does a Galapagos sea lion weigh?\nGalapagos sea lion diet which mainly consists of sardines has a major impact on their weight. They weigh on average between 110-550 lb (50-250 kg). The bull (male) can weigh up to 550 lb (250 kg). Cows (female) weigh less than males.\nWhat are the male and female names of the species?\nMale Galapagos sea lions are known as bulls and female Galapagos sea lions are known as cows.\nWhat would you call a baby Galapagos sea lion?\nThe baby Galapagos sea lion is known as a pup.\nWhat do they eat?\nThese animals feed primarily on sardines which they hunt in the ocean. They may also feed on octopuses, squid, and crustaceans.\nAre they dangerous?\nGalapagos seal lions are social and playful in nature but though they are sociable, they aren't as friendly as other playful animals like bulldogs. The bulls are territorial and aggressive. They may chase swimmers if they get in their way and also bite people if they are bothered. Females and their pups are extremely friendly. They love socializing, they enjoy swimming with people who are snorkeling. The pups are really adorable and inquisitive. They are wild animals, so it's better to maintain a safe distance and their behavior is unpredictable. Along the islands of the Galapagos, humans are forbidden to touch them. They are expected to have at least 2-6 m (6.6-20 ft) of distance from this species. This is to ensure the safety of both humans as well as sea lions.\nWould they make a good pet?\nNo. These are wild animals. They cannot be domesticated.

Plus lots of photos and an amazing video!\n36 Facts About African Lions\nThe African lion is one of the most recognized animals in the world.\nFamous for everything from its shaggy mane to its jaw-cracking roar, it\u2019s an iconic symbol of strength, pride, loyalty, royalty, and fierceness.\nFor your safety: we recommend a good pair of binoculars and a good with zoom lens. These will allow you to see and shoot the lions without risking a face-to-face encounter. we recommend aand a safari-grade camera with zoom lens. These will allow you to see and shoot the lions without risking a face-to-face encounter.\nBut how much do you really know about the African lion? Are you able to tell fact from fiction?\nLet\u2019s test your knowledge. Here are just a few African lion facts for your perusal.\n1. Where do African lions live?\nAfrican lions live in East, West, South and Central Africa. There are no species in the north. They\u2019re sub-Saharan animals, meaning that they live below the Saharan Desert.\nAs for the countries that they roam, it\u2019s a mixed bag. The lion population has declined so dramatically over the years that wild lions are functionally extinct in dozens of African countries, but they can still be found in zoos, nature reserves and national parks.\nThere have also been reports of wild lions popping up in unexpected places and scaring the life out of local residents. They definitely like to keep people on their toes.\nSee the tree-climbing lions of Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. They appear at about 3:45 in the video.\n2. How many African lions are left in the world?\nIt\u2019s estimated that there are around 23,000 \u2013 39,000 lions in the world. The grand majority are in Africa with a small percentage located in India. The most critically endangered species is the West African lion; there are less than 400 remaining.\nIn their prime, there were as many as 200,000 wild lions roaming the whole of the African savanna, but their numbers and ranges are only a fraction of what they used to be.\nTake a look at their distribution map. The red is where they used to live; the blue is where they live today.\n3. What country in Africa has the most lions?\nIf you want to see wild lions in the flesh, you\u2019ll need to travel to South and East Africa. Countries like Tanzania, Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe have the largest lion populations.\nAs for protected lions, they can be found in places like the Masai Mara National Reserve (Kenya) and Etosha National Park (Namibia). You can also take safari circuits around Serengeti National Park (Tanzania) to spot them.\n4. What types of lions live in Africa?\nThis can get a bit complicated, so buckle up.\nLions as a species are classified as panthera leo. This is the umbrella term for all lions everywhere.\nAs for African lions, they come in two subspecies:\nPanthera leo leo (found in West and Central Africa) Panthera leo melanochaita (found in East and Southern Africa)\nThese two species can also be broken down into categories like \u201cMasai lion\u201d and \u201cEthiopian lion.\u201d Each category used to have its own scientific name, and it isn\u2019t uncommon to see older books and websites list them as panthera leo krugeri, panthera leo vernayi or panthera leo massaica.\nIn 2017, however, the Cat Classification Task Force looked at blood samples and realized that all of these fiddly little categories were meaningless from a chromosomal standpoint. African lions only had two types of DNA between them.\nSo, from an official and scientific standpoint, there are only two subspecies of African lions: P. l. leo and P. l. melanochaita. But it\u2019s still common to see people talking about others.\n5. What is the habitat of the African lion?\nAfrican lions live in grassy plains and savannas. They aren\u2019t afraid of bleached yellow fields with the sun beating down on them.\nAt the same time, however, they like to stick close to water sources like lakes, rivers and streams. They also like the dense cover provided by trees and bushes; it\u2019s common for lions to drag their prey into these secluded areas so that they can chow down in peace.\n6. What do African lions eat?\nAfrican lions are carnivores. They eat deer, Cape buffalo, zebra, wildebeests, waterbucks and even baboons. Occasionally, a pride will take down an elephant or giraffe, but this is rare.\nLions generally prefer bigger prey to smaller prey, and they like to hunt free animals in wide, open spaces. They only go after livestock if food is scarce in their region.\nFor example, farmers in Cameroon have reported that lions only feed on their cows and goats during the rainy season when they can\u2019t find food elsewhere.\n7. How often do lions feed?\nLions feed frequently; they\u2019re a lot like humans in the sense that they can\u2019t run on fumes for long. They might last anywhere between 10 \u2013 14 days without food before their bodies start to break down.\nWhen they do eat, however, they feast. Their average intake is around 10 \u2013 20 pounds of meat per day, and this isn\u2019t taking into account the times when they gorge.\nIf they take down a large animal or herd, lions will stuff themselves silly. Males can consume up to 95 pounds at a time; females can eat more than 55 pounds.\n8. How does a lion attack its prey?\nThe first thing to know about lions is that they hunt in groups. They\u2019re unlike every other \u201cbig cat\u201d species in this regard; African leopards and tigers hunt alone, but the lion almost always has a pride.\nThey generally find and stalk their prey around the water sources where they congregate. The other animals come in for a drink, and the lions attack.\nThey aren\u2019t very subtle about it. Lions aren\u2019t sneaky ambush predators who lie in wait before striking at an opportune moment.\nInstead, they charge right in for the kill, and they don\u2019t care if their prey is in a large group. They\u2019ll simply cause a mass panic and use the ensuing chaos to isolate and overwhelm a slow member of the species.\nThis is where their teamwork comes in handy: Once they lock into their prey, they can encircle it and keep it from escaping.\nSome prides even use the same left and right \u201cwing\u201d formations every time that they attack.\n9. What happens when a lion finally catches its prey? Why do they bite the neck?\nLions use their front and back paws to subdue their prey by knocking it off-balance. They might also jump on top of the animal and use their body weight to wrestle it to the ground.\nIf they have a clear shot at the neck, they\u2019ll take it; otherwise, they\u2019ll bite the face, nose, mouth and throat over and over.\nThis is to suffocate the animal while also keeping the lion clear of any horns or hooves that could hurt them.\n10. How do lions eat their prey? Is there anything that a lion won\u2019t eat?\nLions dig into the stomach first. They open the animal\u2019s abdomen and eat its entrails.\nThey\u2019re fond of hearts, livers and kidneys, but they\u2019ll eat almost anything except for the skull and brain. It\u2019s rare for lions to find those tasty. They\u2019ll leave them for another scavenging predator.\n11. How dangerous is the African lion? Is it an aggressive species?\nAfrican lions are extremely dangerous.\nTheir size and strength make them one of the most formidable hunters in the animal kingdom, and they have naturally aggressive personalities that often cause fights even among members of the same pride.\nThey might work together to take down a warthog, but once the warthog is dead, it\u2019s every cat for himself. Smaller and weaker lions might not get a chance to feed at all. Even mothers have been known to leave their cubs hungry in favor of feeding themselves.\n12. Will a lion attack a human? Do lions eat humans?\nYes.\nWhile lion attacks are rarer than you might expect from sensational media coverage, it\u2019s still something that can and does happen. It\u2019s estimated that anywhere from 50 \u2013 100 people are killed by lions every year.\nThe deaths are usually the result of defensive or territorial behavior on behalf of the lion. It\u2019s unusual for lions to stalk humans as prey.\nWhen they do go after humans, however, they tend to be prolific about it. Man-eating lions have been known to stalk specific villages or work sites for months on end.\nThey don\u2019t actually \u201cdevelop a taste for blood,\u201d but they\u2019re smart enough to recognize a stable food source when they see one, so they\u2019ll linger in an area and kill literally hundreds of people until they\u2019re driven off.\n13. What are some famous examples of lion attacks?\nThe craziest lion attacks in the world come from the Tsavo Man-Eaters. They were a pair of lions that terrorized a construction project in the Tsavo region of Kenya and Uganda.\nFor nine months, they dragged men off in the middle of the night to kill and eat them. The final death toll was around 135 people.\nAnother dangerous group of lions were the Njombe Lions. Over the course of three generations, they killed between 1,500 \u2013 2,000 people in the Njombe region of Tanzania. They were active for decades before they were finally eradicated.\nYou might also have heard of the Game of Thrones editor who was killed while on safari in South Africa. She\u2019d rolled down her window to take pictures, and a lion reared up next to her vehicle and killed her. It was a tragedy that made headlines all over the world.\n14. Are lions endangered?\nWhile not quite endangered, lions are listed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Their population is on the decline, and they\u2019re considered functionally extinct in many areas of Africa where they used to be quite frequent. It\u2019s estimated that their numbers fall between 30 \u2013 50 percent every couple of decades.\nThe situation is even worse for the West African lion. It\u2019s considered \u201ccritically endangered\u201d with an extremely low number of sexually mature adults who are able to reproduce.\nThese lions are the focus of several different conservation efforts to preserve their species.\n15. When did the lion become endangered?\nThere\u2019s no exact timeline for the decline of the African lion. In fact, this lack of detailed data is part of the reason why the problem got so bad in the first place.\nFor most of the 20th and 21st century, lions weren\u2019t tracked or monitored by advocacy groups. They seemed to be thriving, and there were plenty of zoos, circuses, reserves and national parks that had lion populations.\nIt wasn\u2019t until recently that people realized just how much the population and range of the lion had decreased. Instead of flourishing in their scattered locations, they were actually dying out. They weren\u2019t being shared, traded or bred fast enough to maintain a stable population.\nAccording to the African Wildlife Foundation, lions have lost 85 percent of their natural range in the past century.\n16. How many lions are left? How many of them are African lions?\nAccording to the IUCN, there are 23,000 \u2013 39,000 African lions in the world. Only 400 or so are West African lions, and less than 250 of those lions are mature adults.\nTo protect their dwindling numbers, most West African lions are kept in federally-funded national parks and nature reserves. They can be found in places like Chad, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Namibia and Niger.\nIf that sounds like a lot, however, you should know that their population in each country can be measured by the dozen. There\u2019s a reason that West African lions are critically endangered.\nThe good news is that the lion species as a whole is hanging in there. They\u2019ve even managed to surprise animal experts every now and then.\nIn 2015, for example, a group of 200 lions were found wandering through a national park in Ethiopia . Wild lions were thought to be extinct in that country, so it caused quite a stir.\n. Wild lions were thought to be extinct in that country, so it caused quite a stir. The same thing happened in Ghana later in the year; a male and female lion were spotted in a national park. It was the first time that wild lions had been recorded in Ghana for 39 years.\n17. How big are African lions? How much do they weigh?\nAfrican lions range from 8 \u2013 10 feet with an average body weight of 320 \u2013 420 pounds. This is the same for both panthera leo leo and panthera leo melanochaita even though the former is usually a bit smaller than the latter. Males are always bigger than females.\nAs for record-breaking felines, the largest verified African lion measured 10.9 feet, and the heaviest weighed 690 pounds. The fat lion was a known man-eater.\nIt\u2019s a bit gruesome to think about how he put on the weight.\nMore reading: Can an ostrich kill a lion?\n18. What does an African lion look like?\nAfrican lions are light yellow to dark brown. They have thick, sturdy bodies with muscular limbs. Their snouts are elongated and topped with whiskers. Like other lions, the males have manes.\nA surprising fact about manes is that they can be different lengths and colors. Some lions have short, choppy manes; others have long, luxurious manes. Their colors include yellow, brown, beige and reddish.\nResearch suggests that the appearance of a lion\u2019s mane might have to do with his fighting prowess. Older, stronger lions tend to have movie-worthy manes while young and weak lions are more ragged.\n19. What did extinct African lions look like?\nThe \u201cCape lion\u201d had a black mane that extended across its entire torso from the shoulders to the belly.\nThe \u201cEthiopian lion\u201d had a dark brown mane with black tips. There\u2019s also some artwork from ancient Egypt where the lions are depicted with no manes at all. It\u2019s a shame that we\u2019ll never get to see these specimens in real life.\n20. Are white lions real?\nYes. White lions are a type of South African lion that are highly prized for their unusual appearance. They aren\u2019t albino; they were simply born or bred with recessive genes. Their coloring can range from a blondish yellow to a true white.\nThe rarest lion of all is the blue-eyed white lion. They\u2019re so striking that African tribes have worshiped them as gods or the favorites of the gods.\nOne legend has it that white lions were the first animals to be created, so they\u2019ll be the last animals to die. When all other life has ended, the roar of the white lion will be the last thing ever heard in the world.\n21. What are the differences between Asian lions and African lions?\nThe easiest way to differentiate between Asian and African lions is by looking at their bellies. The Asian lion has a vertical \u201cfold\u201d of skin that runs along its stomach, and this feature isn\u2019t present in African lions.\nAside from that, African lions are bigger and stronger than Asian lions. They also have larger manes and tails.\nOne interesting thing to note about Asian and African lions is that they can\u2019t be cross-bred. A disastrous attempt was made in the \u201980s, but it produced weak, sickly hybrids that didn\u2019t survive for very long.\nEven though other cats like tigers and leopards can be cross-bred with different types of their own species, Asian and African lions simply don\u2019t mix.\n22. What\u2019s the lifespan of the African lion?\nIt\u2019s difficult to determine the lifespan of an African lion because they rarely die of natural causes. However, it\u2019s generally agreed that they live between 10 \u2013 15 years in the wild.\nIn captivity, they can last around 20 \u2013 25 years. According to the Animal Aging and Longevity Database, the oldest lion ever recorded was 27 years old when he died. He lived in a zoo.\n23. What do you call a group of lions? How large are these groups?\nA group of lions is called a pride. They can grow as large as 40 lions in a single pride, but the average is closer to 13 \u2013 15. They don\u2019t spend all of their time together; it\u2019s common for smaller groups to wander off and hunt, roam, mate and play. Females drastically outnumber males in every pride.\n24. How many male lions are in a pride? Can there be more than one?\nThere are usually 2 \u2013 3 males in every pride with 10 \u2013 12 females. The females are all related, but the males will break away or be forced away from the pride when they start to mature.\nThey might survive as solitary animals for a while, or they might form \u201ccoalitions\u201d with other unattached males.\nWhen they reach full maturity, they\u2019ll forcibly fight and take over another pride.\n25. How old are male lions when they leave the pride?\nMale lions are usually around 2 \u2013 3 years old when they leave their pride, and they\u2019re 5 \u2013 6 years old when they start challenging the males of other prides.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to understand that lions aren\u2019t like wolves. There\u2019s no \u201calpha\u201d or \u201cdominant\u201d male that rules over everyone.\nThe males in a pride might attack each other for food or mating rights, but these conflicts are rarely fatal, and the beaten lion will simply lick his wounds for awhile before issuing another challenge.\nThe next time, he might win the fight and be the first one to eat a liver or mate with a female. The hierarchy of a pride can be quite flexible in this way.\n26. What happens during a takeover? Is it true that male lions kill the cubs?\nYes. Incoming male lions will slaughter the cubs of the pride that they\u2019re taking over.\nWhen a male lion successfully fights and integrates with a new pride, one of his primary goals is reproducing as quickly as possible.\nA quirk of lion mothers is that they aren\u2019t interested in re-mating until their cubs are around 18 months old, but they\u2019ll re-mate in days if their cubs are lost or killed.\nSo, to expedite his own reproduction, a male will kill the existing cubs in a pride and free up the mothers for mating.\n27. Do the mothers attempt to save their cubs?\nThey might have the occasional moment of selfishness over food, but female lions will fiercely defend their cubs during a takeover. They\u2019re usually joined by other mothers and females in the pride.\nIn fact, some prides have \u201ccreches\u201d of mothers that communally raise and nurse their babies, and if they\u2019re attacked by an incoming male or male coalition, they\u2019ll work together to drive them off.\n28. Do male lions hate cubs in general?\nNo. The Lion King didn\u2019t lie to you; adult male lions can be very affectionate towards their offspring, allowing them to play with their manes or nip at their tails.\nIt just has to be their offspring and not another males. Remember this fact the next time that you judge Scar for hating Simba.\n29. Do African lions have any mating rituals?\nAfrican lions reach sexual maturity between 3 \u2013 4 years for females and 5 \u2013 6 years for males. They\u2019ll mate at any time of year, so there\u2019s no particular season or month for it.\nThey\u2019re also a bit like rabbits in the sense that they just don\u2019t stop once they get going. A pair of mating lions will join together between 20 \u2013 50 times per day!\n30. How often do African lions give birth? What\u2019s the process like?\nFemale African lions generally breed every two years or so. As previously discussed, they won\u2019t be interested in new males until their cubs are around 18 months old, so that\u2019s a mandatory break in the mating cycle unless their cubs are lost or killed.\nThey generally break away from the pride after getting pregnant. They\u2019ll set up a den in a secluded cave or thicket, and after 3 \u2013 4 months, they\u2019ll give birth to anything from a single cub to a small litter.\n31. How long does the African lion cub stay with its mother?\nAfrican lion cubs are completely dependent on their mothers after birth. They\u2019re born blind, only opening their eyes after a week or so, and they can\u2019t walk for close to a month.\nAs you might imagine, this leaves them extremely vulnerable to predators. From scavenging hyenas to takeovers from unattached male lions, they\u2019re helpless before the dangers of the world. It\u2019s estimated that 80 percent of lion cubs don\u2019t make it to adulthood.\nMothers will return to their pride when their cubs are 6 \u2013 8 weeks old. If any creches exist, she\u2019ll join them. Female cubs grow up and stay with their pride; male cubs grow up and set off to challenge others.\n32. What threats face the African lion?\nHunting is the single biggest threat to the African lion. They\u2019ve been considered trophies since ancient times, and their bones and body parts are used in a variety of foods, medicines and fashion accessories.\nIt\u2019s illegal in many African countries to kill a lion, but that doesn\u2019t stop people from doing it. Farmers shoot or poison lions in retaliation for killing their livestock; hunters come to Africa for the glory of killing big game.\nThere\u2019s also a booming trade industry for lion parts. Between 2008 and 2016, more than 6,000 skulls, claws and lion skeletons were exported from South Africa to Asia.\n33. Is a tiger stronger than a lion? Can a tiger kill a lion?\nIt\u2019s the \u201cSuperman Versus Batman\u201d question of the animal kingdom. If a tiger and a lion got into a fight, who would win?\nThe short answer is that it depends. Both species are around the same size, and they\u2019re both considered apex predators in their natural habitats. You can\u2019t say that a tiger would always defeat a lion or vice versa.\nGenerally speaking, however, the tiger does have an advantage over the lion. Tigers are used to hunting as individuals while lions nearly always take down their prey in packs. In a one-on-one fight with everything else being equal, the odds would probably be on the tiger.\nAnother factor to consider is the type of tiger (there are 6 living subspecies).\nAnd the fact that there are no tigers in the wild in Africa. This would make this question of dominance less weighty \u2013 because the odds are against them ever meeting.\nHere\u2019s an entire breakdown of the debate if you\u2019d like to read more.\n34. Are male lions stronger and faster than females?\nMale lions are bigger and heavier than females, but there\u2019s been some research to suggest that females are faster.\nIt might have something to do with their hunting habits. Females are the primary hunters of their pride.\nLions are some of the fastest land animals in the world.\n35. Why do lions roar? Why are they so loud?\nLions might roar for any number of reasons. They might do it as an aggressive gesture to warn away other lions in the area; they might do it to locate their own pride if it\u2019s scattered across the savanna.\nTheir big, ear-splitting roars are the ones that are always depicted in movies, but roars can also be quite soft. For example, a lioness might gently roar to collect her wayward cubs. This is less of a \u201cback off\u201d roar and more of a \u201ckids, it\u2019s time to come inside\u201d roar.\n36. Do lions have any significance in African culture or history?\nLions have been featured in art, dance, poetry, literature, and folklore as long as Africa has been a continent.\nThey\u2019ve had immense meaning to everyone from ancient pharaohs to modern shamans. Some people believe that lions are good luck or signs of strength; others believe that lions are man-eating omens of death and doom.\nRegardless of what you might think about African lions, however, one thing is for sure: They\u2019re definitely some of the most memorable creatures in the animal kingdom.\nKeep reading: What\u2019s the Difference: Panther vs Jaguar?"}

How did they cope with other large predators (e.g. saber-toothed tigers) and the first people who shared the same living areas? Why did they go extinct? We will try to answer these questions in this article. In the previous article, we have presented American lions\u2019 cousins from Europe and Asia \u2013 Eurasian cave lions.\nClassification\nClass: Mammal\nMammal Oder: Carnivora\nCarnivora Family: Felidae\nFelidae Genus: Panthera\nPanthera Species: Panthera leo\nPanthera leo Subspecies: Panthera leo atrox\nPanthera leo atrox Names: The American lion, the North American lion, American cave lion, Naegele\u2019s giant jaguar\nDating and occurrence\nThis extinct and great cat lived in North America and north-western regions of South America in the Pleistocene from 1.8m to 11,000 years ago. It went extinct along with mammoths and other large mammals of the Pleistocene megafauna. Genetic analyses have showed that it was a sister lineage of the European lion.\nIt is believed, that the American lion was an endemic species of North America, and it got to the southern continent through a land passage that connected two Americas.\nHowever, what is interesting, the structure of the fossils found in Peru has been more similar to the bones of a big jaguar than a lion.\nAppearance, diet and extinction\nThe body length of this predator ranged between 160-250 cm, and its average height at shoulders was 120 cm, with a weight of 250-360 kg. Thus, it was the largest known species/subspecies of the lion in the history of Earth. However, if its measurements were real, it is possible that this animal belonged to the jaguar or the tiger species.\nAmerican lion vs. smilodon\nThe American lion coexisted with the smilodon \u2013 the saber-toothed tiger (Smilodon populator) \u2013 but it was lighter (the smilodon weighed 360-400 kg) and had a different hunting pattern than the prehistoric tiger.\nOn the other hand, the American lion could have been more intelligent than the smilodon; thousands of hunting saber-toothed tigers were captured in La Brea Tar Pits, but only several tens of American lions fell into that trap.\nIntelligence could have been a key feature that guaranteed survival in the Pleistocene ecosystem of North America.\nExcavations and skeletons\nThe majority of American lions\u2019 skeletons \u2013 about 100 \u2013 were found in La Brea Tar Pits (Los Angeles). Thanks to these fossils, the anatomy of this animal was well-explored. It turned out that the body structure and teeth had been very similar to those of modern-day lions, but the prehistoric species was larger (by 25%) and heavier.\nOther predators\nThe habitat of the American lion was full of other tremendous predators, such as the short-faced bear (Arctodus simus) or the so-called dire wolf (Canis dirus), which competed with the American lion for food.\nDiet\nAmerican lions were likely to have hunted on deer, equidae, and camelids of the species Camelophs hesternus, so-called Californian tapirs (Tapirus californicus), bison, mammoths, and other big herbivores.\nExtinction\nThe end of the last glaciation and the fact that humans increasingly hunted for the possible prey of the lions contributed to the extinction of, among others, the short-faced bear, dire wolf, and American lion.\nDetails and dimensions (size)\nThe American lion (Panthera leo atrox / Panthera atrox)\nDated: 1.8m \u2013 11,000 years ago (the Pleistocene)\n1.8m \u2013 11,000 years ago (the Pleistocene) Main areas of occurrence: North and South America\nNorth and South America Body length without the tail: 160 \u2013 250 cm (5ft 3in \u2013 8ft 2in)\n160 \u2013 250 cm (5ft 3in \u2013 8ft 2in) Height at shoulders: 120 cm (3.94 ft)\n120 cm (3.94 ft) Weight: 250 \u2013 350 kg (551 \u2013 771 lb)\nPreviously it was thought, the American Lion weighed more.

Because these wild cats of North America can sometimes live near our own backyards, we obviously have some questions. So in this article we\u2019ll answer some of those common cougar questions, and learn some cool facts about Mountain Lions.\n10 interesting facts about Mountain Lions\n1. Are cougars and mountain lions the same?\nYes, they are! The terms Mountain Lion and Cougar are interchangeable and refer to the same animal and species (Puma concolor). In fact the names Puma, Panther, Painter, Mexican Lion, and Catamount, in addition to Mountain Lion and Cougar, are all different names for the same species.\nAnd there are more names beyond that! Because of their historic wide distribution, each region came up with their own names for these big cats, no wonder they are known as \u201cthe cat of many names\u201d.\n2. Are mountain lion attacks common?\nMountain lion attacks on humans are considered rare. They are very solitary creatures who prefer to pass by unseen. Even when living alongside humans, they rarely make their presence known. It is thought this is in part because they are not habituated to humans, and do not see them as prey.\nThis may begin to change as humans continue to move into their habitat, and it will be inevitable the number of encounters will increase. But cougars do not usually attack unless they feel cornered, or if someone running away from them triggers a chase response.\nAs housing and development expands further into their prime territories, these encounters will inevitably increase. Attacks and fatalities are still very rare, so take some comfort in that!\n3. When are mountain lions most active?\nMountain lions are considered to be both crepuscular and nocturnal. Crepuscular means they like the early dawn and late twilight hours, and nocturnal means they are also active at night. They can certainly be seen during the day, but dawn, dusk and night is when they are most active.\n4. Where do mountain lions sleep?\nYou might be thinking cougar retreat to a \u201chome base\u201d cave or a den for sleeping, but this is not the case. Most of the time they are always on the move around their territory, and cougars will just find a suitably sheltered spot to sleep.\nUnless they have a large carcass they are feeding on over multiple days or the female is having kittens, mountain lions don\u2019t tend to stay in one spot for more than a few days.\n5. How long do mountain lions live?\nThe average life span in the wild is ten years. However in captivity, with no threat of hunting, starvation or many other typical dangers, mountain lions can live 20 plus years.\n6. What sounds do mountain lions make?\nUnlike other \u201cbig cats\u201d, mountain lions do not have the ability to roar. They do not possess the same larynx and hyoid apparatus of the other big cat species that gives them this ability.\nHowever mountain lions can make other sounds you may associate with cats such as hissing, growling, chirps and purrs. Mountain lions are also known for their eery \u201cscreaming\u201d which occurs during mating.\n7. What is an \u201cumbrella species\u201d?\nUmbrella species is a term sometimes used in the world of environmental conservation. It refers to a species who\u2019s protection inadvertently benefits many other species. Mountain lions are often considered umbrella species because of the large amounts of open habitat and wilderness they require to thrive.\nFor example they need almost 13 times the amount of area a black bear needs, or 40 times what a bobcat needs. So by protection cougars and creating legislation to preserve habit for them, it also has the potential to benefit many other animals species.\n8. Can mountain lions jump?\nMountain lions actually have the largest hind legs (proportionally) of all the members of the cat family. This makes cougars great jumpers, able to leap from the ground 18 feet up into a tree. Their large hind legs also make them excellent at sprinting for short distances.\n9. What do mountain lion tracks look like?\nAdult cougar paw-prints are about 4-5 inches across for males, and <3.5 inches for females. Their heel pad is in a bit of an \u201cM\u201d shape at the bottom with a divot on top. Both front and back paws have four \u201ctear drop\u201d shaped toes, with one leading toe that is slightly higher than the others.\nTypically their tracks do not show any claw marks, unlike tracks of dogs or coyotes. They usually keep their claws retracted unless they are maneuvering on difficult terrain.\n10. How far do mountain lions roam?\nOn average, males have a home range covering from 50-150 square miles. Females have slightly smaller ranges of about 50 square miles. The males range may overlap with about 3-4 females, but no other males.\nFemales have less of a problem with their ranges overlapping with other females, while males do not want another male in their range. Often young female cougars will choose a territory next to the one in which they were born, where young males may travel very far to establish their own area.\nMales have been occasionally spotted in many states of the east, who traveled there from the west. The famous \u201cConnecticut mountain lion\u201d traveled 1500 miles from South Dakota, the furthest trek currently recorded.\nWhile this isn\u2019t the norm, it is becoming slightly more common as mountain lions are striking out further east in search of territory."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Cape Lion images!\n\u201cRecognizable by its black-maned appearance, the Cape lion was once native to Africa\u2019s southern Cape region.\u201d\nThis wild cat is a member of the subspecies Panthera leo melanochaita. For centuries, it lived in relative peace and isolation on the South African plains. Following the arrival of European settlers, however, it endured decades of constant hunting and harassment, causing numbers to dwindle. The conservation status of this lion is considered to be functionally extinct in the wild since 1858 (though scattered individuals were found up to a few decades later).\nA Subspecies That Has Been the Subject of Debate\nThe taxonomy of the Cape lion (as well as other lion populations) has been the subject of much-extended controversy. For centuries, the Cape lion was considered to be its own distinctive subspecies of lions. But then a genetic analysis in 2017 revealed that the Cape lion may not be quite as distinct as once thought. Genetically, it is almost completely similar to other lion populations of southern and eastern Africa. This suggests there may have been significant interbreeding between the populations that prevented them from developing independently of each other. All lions in the southern and eastern regions of Africa are now considered to be part of the same subspecies.\nAnother source of dispute is whether these lions still exist in captivity somewhere. In 2000, a South African zoo director named John Spence claimed that, after a careful search, he had identified possible descendants of Cape lion specimens still living in Russia\u2019s Novosibirsk Zoo, which might have been taken from South Africa and interbred with other types of lions. However, before he had could perform a DNA analysis (with the intention to breed back the Cape lion into existence), Spence died in 2010, and no one else took up the cause.\n4 Incredible Cape Lion Facts!\nBased on genetic analysis, it\u2019s thought that the Cape lion first evolved in the Late Pleistocene, around 500,000 years ago.\nOne of the most interesting facts is that the lion can interbreed with both a tiger and a leopard. The offspring of a male lion and tigress is called a liger. If the offspring is the result of a tiger and lioness, then it\u2019s called a tigon. The result of a leopard and lioness is called a leopon.\nThe lion represents strength and nobility in many African cultures. It features prominently in ancient stories and proverbs.\nPreserved Cape lion specimens are kept at several museums around the world, including the Swedish Museum of National History, the Paris Museum of Natural History, and the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History.\nScientific Name\nThe scientific name for the Cape lion is Panthera leo melanochaitus. Melan (or melas) means black in Greek and may be a reference to the lion\u2019s black-maned appearance. Since the Cape lion is no longer considered to be its own separate subspecies, the other members of melanochaitus are still alive in parts of southern and eastern Africa, though dwindling in number. The lion in general is part of the same genus as the leopard, tiger, and jaguar. The species name Leo is the Latin name for the lion.\nAppearance\nThe Cape lion has all the physical attributes of a lion, including a big head, muscular body, yellowish tawny coat, white stomach, and a long tail with a black tuft at the end. The biggest distinguishing feature is the darker color of the male\u2019s mane, which extended along the shoulders and below the stomach. This subspecies appears to have been particularly large for a lion, with some specimens weighing nearly 600 pounds and measuring around seven feet long. Males tend to be larger than females by about 100 pounds and, of course, grow a large mane of hair around the neck.\nBehavior\nWhile the Cape lion was driven to extinction before it could be fully studied, we can infer some facts about its behavior by observing other members of the same species. The lion is the only member of the cat family that exhibits highly social behavior. The basis of this society is the pride. With potentially up to 40 distinct members, the pride consists of several generations of lionesses, a small number of breeding males, and the cubs. Members may break up into smaller groups during the day and only come together to hunt and eat.\nA single pride may occupy the same territory for multiple generations. When prey is particularly abundant, the total territory can reach up to eight square miles, but when sparse, it can stretch up to 150 square miles. Lions mark their territory by urinating, defecating, and rubbing up against vegetation with their scent glands.\nEach member of the pride is thought to adopt a general role. Males are more likely to guard the territory against potential rival prides. Mothers form their own separate mini-group and nurse each other\u2019s cubs. They give nursing priority to their own cubs, followed by the offspring of closely related lions. Both males and females can take part in the group hunt. While scientists still debate why lions are the only wild cats to form groups, larger prides do appear to confer greater reproductive success in the wild.\nThe typical lion spends around 22 hours per day resting. Only two or three hours are spent hunting; perhaps more if the prey is particularly difficult to find. They communicate with each other through several sophisticated methods of smell, sound, and body movements. Head nuzzling appears to be a form of greeting while licking and grooming help to facilitate social bonding. The lion can make a kind of grimace, with an open mouth, bared teeth, wrinkled nose, and closed eyes, in response to sniffing chemical signals. Roaring is commonly done in the evening before a hunt and again at dawn to advertise its presence. The sound can be heard from more than three miles all around it.\nHabitat\nThe Cape lion once roamed the plains of South Africa. It was particularly prominent around the semi-desert Karoo plains within the interior of the country, just south of the Orange River, which runs along the border of Namibia and close to the Kalahari Desert. The other members of the melanochaita subspecies live as far north as Kenya.\nPredators and Threats\nThe Cape lion was driven to extinction by the twin threats of hunting and habitat loss by European settlers. It\u2019s not clear if the lion was under threat before the colonization of South Africa, but lion numbers have been falling almost everywhere around the globe for many thousands of years. Hunting may have been done both for sport and to prevent the lion from killing livestock. They were shot in greater numbers than any other population of African lions.\nWhat eats the Cape lion?\nAn adult Cape lion had no natural predators in its native habitat, but the cubs were occasionally killed by larger predators such as hyenas, leopards, and jackals.\nWhat does the Cape lion eat?\nThe Cape lion was considered to be an apex predator and an important keystone animal in its natural habitat. Its diet largely consisted of hoofed animals such as wildebeests, antelopes, and zebras. If an opportunity arose, then it could also hunt Cape buffalo, rodents, and juvenile or injured elephants and hippos. Lions hunt by stalking their prey from cover and then lunging at its neck. The victim usually dies from strangulation shortly afterward.\nIf the lions have to pursue their prey over long distances, then they will usually tire out easily. This caused most hunts to end prematurely in failure. A single lion could consume around 75 pounds in a single meal. Pride mates would squabble over meals, but the successful hunters responsible for the kill would usually receive first dibs. After resting for a week, the lions would resume the hunt once again.\nReproduction and Life Cycle\nCape lions had no established reproductive season; they could mate at almost any time of the year. Both male and female lions were polygamous, meaning they had multiple sexual partners over the course of a lifetime. A female will almost always mate with another member of its own pride. Once a pair has bonded, it could copulate up to 50 times per day. The frequency of their mating is intended to stimulate fertilization and also ensure that no other male can copulate with the female (which also had the added benefit of guaranteeing the male\u2019s paternity).\nAfter a gestation period of more than a hundred days, the female would give birth to no more than six cubs at a time. Born blind and helpless, the cubs were covered in a thick coat and dark spots. They were fully weaned by the age of six or seven months and learned to hunt by around 11 months old. It took around two years before they could become functionally independent, however.\nUntil that time, the mortality rates of lions were exceptionally high. They face numerous threats from hungry predators, the harsh landscape, and adult males that take over a pride and kill the previous offspring. The group of mothers will attempt to defend their cubs from this infanticide for as long as possible.\nMale cubs are expelled from the pride upon reaching sexual maturity at the age of three or four; they wander alone until they\u2019re old and strong enough to take a pride of their own. Females often remain with the pride even beyond the age of sexual maturity, but they too can be expelled if there\u2019s no room in the pride. Lions can sometimes live more than 25 years in captivity, but their expected lifespan is generally shortened to around 10 years in the wild because of hunting, starvation, and early childhood mortality.\nPopulation\nThe Cape lion\u2019s conservation status is extinct. No confirmed specimens are remaining anywhere in the world.\nView all 153 animals that start with C"}

The species used to prey on large herbivores such as reindeer, bison, and mammoths. The Panthera leo spelaea is said to the subspecies of the European cave lion. People often call the cave lions by different names such as the Eurasian cave lions and steppe lions.\nWhat class of animal does a European cave lion belong to?\nThe Eurasian cave lion belongs to the class of Mammalia, the family of Felidae, and the Panthera genus.\nHow many European cave lions are there in the world?\nThere is no Eurasian lion (Panthera spelaea) left in the world. The species became extinct in the late Pleistocene period, about 13,000 years ago.\nWhere does a European cave lion live?\nThe Panthera leo spelaea was widely distributed to several parts of the European continent such as the Iberian Peninsula, Great Britain, Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and plains of East Europe. The Eurasian cave lions are also believed to be found in Russia, Turkistan, and a few regions of North America such as Canada and Alaska, a state in the United States.\nWhat is a European cave lion's habitat?\nAs the name suggests, Eurasian cave lions were prominently found in caves. Also, the Panthera leo spelaea are believed to be found near the habitats of medium to large sized herbivores, thus it can be said that the cave lion used to dwell in coniferous forests and grasslands. The adult cave lion skeleton found in the cave bear dens reveals that the lions might have entered the cave bear dens to prey.\nWho do European cave lions live with?\nLike modern lions, the Eurasian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea) was not a solitary creature and prefer to live in groups. These lions used to prey on the cave hyena, deer, reindeer, and other animals by forming large groups.\nHow long does a European Cave Lion live?\nThe exact lifespan of the Eurasian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea) is not known but the modern lions (Panthera leo) generally live for around 8-15 years while the species can live for more than 25 years in captivity.\nHow do they reproduce?\nNo exact information regarding the breeding pattern of the Eurasian cave lion (Panthera spelaea) is available as of now but it is believed that the extinct cave lion used similar methods to reproduce. The modern lions (Panthera leo) follow the polygyny mating system in which males mate with more than one female. Unlike other species, the males of the pride or group generally do not fight over females and the one who reaches a female first in the heat cycle has more chances to mate.\nThe male modern lion generally controls the reproduction of the females and rule over the pride, the competition among the males sometimes leads to infanticide. Females usually mate throughout the year and the breeding peaks in the rainy season. The females become sexually matured at four years of age while it takes around five to six years in males. The gestation period lasts for around 3.5 to four months and the females give birth to around one to six cubs. It is believed that the average range of the cave lion cubs would be around one to six. After five to seven months of age, the cubs are released by the parents.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe Eurasian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea) became extinct in the late Pleistocene period, about 13,000 years ago.\nEuropean Cave Lion Fun Facts\nWhat do European cave lions look like?\nThe European or Eurasian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea) looks similar to modern lions but larger. The giant species often prey on deer, reindeer, old or injured mammoths, and other large sized herbivores. The species is also believed to be closely related to the Panthera tigris or the modern tigers as the shape of their skull was almost the same.\n*Please note the image is of Panthera leo of the Felidae family. If you an image of the European cave lion, let us know at [email protected]\nHow cute are they?\nAs we know that the Eurasian cave lion was one of the largest lions and as the modern lion, the cave lion would have been quite adorable as well. The most fascinating and cutest are the cubs, everyone loves to watch them playing, running around their parents, and biting each other. By observing such mischievous behaviors, no one can wonder that these little cuties would one day become the emperor of the jungle.\nHow do they communicate?\nLike the modern lion, the Eurasian cave lion is believed to follow the same methods while communicating. Cats generally are quite territorial and males often mark their territory with their urine that gives a warning to the others who try to come closer. The mane or the hair generally describes the sex of the approaching lion. The most common way of communicating is their roar, males possess louder and deeper voices compared to females. The roar could be an indication of aggression and dominance to their enemies or a way of social bonding. Lactating and nursing cubs are a few other methods of communication seen in the big cats.\nHow big is a European cave lion?\nThe Eurasian cave lion size is quite big compared to several modern day wild cats. The average body length would have been around 6.11 ft (210 cm) without the tail while the average cave lion height was around 3.11 ft (120 cm). These lions are twice and thrice the size of the striped hyenas and clouded leopards respectively.\nHow fast can a European cave lion run?\nIt is said that cave lions were one of the fastest animals of the Pleistocene epoch and the average speed was around 30 mph (48 kph). With such stamina and strength, the species was able to hunt huge sized animals.\nHow much does a European cave lion weigh?\nThe average cave lion weight was around 440-771 lb (200-350 kg).\nWhat are the male and female names of the species?\nMales of the Panthera spelaea and Pantera leo species are called lions while the female is called a lioness. Males are generally bigger compared to females and the former even possess a mane around their necks.\nWhat would you call a baby European cave lion?\nThe babies or the offspring of the European cave lion are known as cubs.\nWhat do they eat?\nEuropean cave lions were carnivores and used to prey on large-sized herbivores such as reindeer, deer, old or injured mammoths, and many more. Some even also hunted food from the dens of cave bears.\nAre they dangerous?\nLike modern lions, the European cave lions were quite aggressive and dangerous. They had strong teeth and a bone-crushing bite force of 1800 lb (816 kg), almost twice the bite force of modern day lions. They used to prey on giant mammoths and reindeers. Some even also hunted from the dens of cave bears. If the species had not become extinct, cave lions would have been one of the most dangerous animals in contemporary times.\nWould they make a good pet?\nThe Eurasian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea) became extinct in the late Pleistocene period, about 13,000 years ago. Also, people generally do not consider modern lions are pets due to their aggressive nature, in several countries keeping lions as pets is illegal.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nSeveral discoveries have been made in recent years. Two frozen cubs were found near the Uyandina River, Russia, and Serbia respectively in 2015. The cubs were around 25,000-50,000 years old. In 2017, another frozen cub was found on the banks of the Tirekhtyakh River, Russia.\nAnother extinct species, the American lion found in several parts of North America is a sister lineage of the European cave lion.\nAre cave lions extinct?\nYes, the European cave lion (Panthera spelaea) became extinct in the late Pleistocene period, about 13,000 years ago. Studies reveal that the reduction in the availability of the prey might have played a significant role in the extinction of the species.\nWhy are they called cave lions?\nEuropean cave lions did not dwell in caves but were found in coniferous forests and grasslands. The species used to prey on the cave bears and several fossils of the species were found in the caves as well, the species came to known as cave lions.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

As far as paleontologists can tell, the Barbary Lion (Panthera leo leo) evolved from a population of European Lions (Panthera leo europaea), which themselves descended from Asiatic Lions (Panthera leo persica), which are still extant, albeit in dwindling numbers, in modern-day India. Whatever its ultimate heritage, the Barbary Lion shares one dubious honor with most lion subspecies, having been wiped off the face of the earth by human encroachment and the dwindling of its once-expansive habitat.\nLike many other recently extinct mammals, the Barbary Lion has a distinctive historical pedigree. Medieval Britons had an especial fondness for this big cat; during the Middle Ages, Barbary Lions were kept in the menagerie at the Tower of London, and these big-maned beasts were star attractions at swanky British hotels. In the latter part of the 19th century, while the species was being hunted to extinction in northern Africa, Britain's surviving Barbary Lions were transferred to zoos. In northern Africa, even in historical times, Barbary Lions were prized gifts, sometimes being offered in lieu of taxes to the ruling families of Morocco and Ethiopia.\nToday, in captivity, a few surviving lion subspecies harbor remnants of Barbary Lion genes, so it may yet be possible to selectively breed this big cat and reintroduce it into the wild, a program known as de-extinction. For example, researchers with the International Barbary Lion Project plan to recover DNA sequences from various mounted Barbary Lion specimens in natural history museums, and then compare these sequences with the DNA of living zoo lions, in order to see how much \"Barbary.\" so to speak, remains in these felines. Males and females with a high percentage of Barbary Lion DNA would then be selectively mated, as well as their descendants on down the lion, the ultimate goal being the birth of a Barbary Lion cub!"}

Its imposing size, strength and roar make it a difficullt opponent to overcome within the ecosystem. Despite this, however, there are still some lives in danger of extinction and/or that have died of entirely. Are you looking for a full list of types of lion? If so, you\u00b4ve come to the right place! Keep reading here at AnimalWised to discover how many types of lions are there, including lion characteristics and pictures.\nTypes of lions\nAt present, there is one type of surviving lion (Panthera leo), from which 7 lion subspecies derive. Some lion species became extinct thousands of years ago, while others have disappeared as a result of humans. Additionally, it is important to know that all surviving lion species are in fact in danger of extinction. This number, however, corresponds to lions belonging to the cat family, but did you know that there are also types of sea lions? As for this marine animal, there are 7 genera of sea lions made up of several species. Now that you know how many types of lions there are in the world, keep reading to find out more about each.\nLion species classification\nBefore we begin with this complete list of lion species and their characteristic, let\u00b4s take a look at the root. The panthera leo is the species from which all lion subspecies descend. The Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) only recognizes this species, and the Panthera leo persica and Panthera leo leo as the only subspecies. However, other taxonomic lists, such as ITIS, identify more varieties. Where do lions live? - Lion habitat Lions live in herds and inhabit the grasslands, savannas and jungles of Africa. These herds are generally composed of one or two males and several female lions. Lions live an average of 7 years and are considered \"kings of the jungle\" due to its unmatchable hunting capacity. Lions are carnivorous animals that feed on antelopes, zebras, etc., Female lions are responsible for hunting and keeping the herd well fed. Another of the most common lion characteristics are their marked sexual dimorphism. Males tend to be larger than females and have abundant manes, not present on females. Different types of lions names The lion subspecies that currently exist and are recognized by the various official organizations include: Katanga lion (Southwest African lion)\nCongo Lion (Northeast Congo lion)\nTransvaal Lion (Southeastern lion)\nBarbary lion\nNubian Lion (East African lion)\nAsiatic lion\nWest African lion For more, you may be interested in reading our article where we discuss cat hybrids. Keep reading to discover these types of lions characteristics.\nKatanga lion\nAmong the types of lions and their characteristics we have the Kantaga lion, also referred to as the Southwest (Panthera leo bleyenberghi). This large lion subspecies is capable of reaching up to 280 kilograms in weight. As for its appearance, the Kantaga lion stands out for its characteristic sand colored thick and imposing mane. The outermost area of the mane can appear in a combination of light brown, coffee-colored.\nCongo Lion\nThe Congo lion (Panthera leo azandica), also known as the central African lion, is a lion subspecies distributed along the plains of the African continent, especially in Uganda and the Republic of the Congo. The Congo lion is characterized by a measurement of between 2 meters and 50 centimeters and/or 2 meters 80 centimeters. In addition, this lion subspecies can weigh between 150 and 190 kilos. Male congo lions are recognizable by their dark characteristic mane, less leafy than other lion varieties. Its fur color can range between sand and dark brown.\nTransvaal lion\nThe Panthera leo krugeri, more commonly referred to as the Transvaal lion, is from South Africa. This African lion is a variety from the southern part of Africa, and is considered the sister lion to the Katanga lion. Male Transvaal lion species can reach up to 2 meters and 50 centimeters in length. Although they have the typical sand color in the fur, there are rare white lions from this variety. The white lion is a mutation of the krugeri, and the white fur appears as a result of a recessive gene. Despite their noticeable beauty, the white lion is vulnerable in the wild, especially because its light color is difficult to camouflage in the savanna.\nBarbary lion\nThe Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo), is a subspecies that became extinct around 1942. There are, however, some specimens that can be found in zoos, such as those found in Rabat (Morocco). However, crossing with other lion subspecies complicates the task of raising pure Barbary lion individuals. According to records, this subspecies would be one of the largest, characterized by a large and lush mane. They live in both the Savannah and African jungles.\nEast African lion\nAnother of the types of lions that still exist is Panthera leo nubica, also recognized as the East African lion. Its body weight ranges between an average of the lion species, that is, between 150 and 200 kilos. The male of this subspecies has an abundant and darker mane than other lion subspecies.\nAsiatic lion\nThe Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) is native to India, although today it can be found in zoos and reserves in various parts of the world. This variety is smaller than other types of lions and has a lighter coat, with reddish mane in males. The Asiatic lion is currently among the types of lion in danger of extinction, mainly due to the reduction of their habitat, poaching and rivalry with inhabitants of their environment.\nWest African lion\nLast on our list of types of lions is the West African lion, also known as the Panthera leo senegalensis or lion of West Africa. This lion subspecies lives in packs and measures about 3 meters, including its tail. This variety is in danger of extinction due to poaching and the city expansion, decreasing the amount of prey available.\nEndangered lions\nAll types of lions are considered vulnerable in danger of extinction. Over the years, populations in the wild have declined and births in captivity are scarce. Why are lions endangered? The most common threats to lions and lion subspecies include: Expansion of commercial and residential areas that reduce the lion's natural habitat.\nDecrease in species for lions to feed on.\nIntroduction of other species or rivalry with other predators for prey.\nPoaching.\nExpansion of agriculture and livestock.\nWar and military conflicts in the lion's habitat. Keep reading to discover our complete list of extinct and endangered lion species:\nExtinct lion species\nUnfortunately, several species of lions have ceased to exist for various reasons, most due to human intervention. The types of extinct lion species include: Black lion\nCave Lion\nPrimitive Cave Lion\nAmerican lion\nBlack lion\nPanthera leo melanochaitus, referred to more commonly as the Black lion or cape lion, is a subspecies that was declared extinct in 1860. Before disappearing completely, this lion species inhabited the southwest of South Africa. Little is known about this lion species expect that they weighed between 150 and 250 kilos and lived alone, contrary to common lion packs today. The males had a black mane, hence their name. The black lion disappeared from the African continent during English colonization, as a result of human attacks. Despite its extinction, lions in the Kalahari region are considered to have a genetic load from the black lion species.\nEurasian cave lion\nPanthera leo spelaea, also referred to as the Eurasian cave lion, was a species that was found in the Iberian Peninsula, England and Alaska. This lion subspecies inhabited the Earth during the Pleistocene, 2.60 million years ago. Evidence of its existence lies in cave paintings from 30,000 years ago and fossils. In general, its characteristics were similar to those of the current lion: between 2.5 and 3 meters long, and 200 kilos in weight.\nPrimitive cave lion\nThe primitive cave lion (Panthera leo fossilis) is another type of lion that became extinct during the Pleistocene. This lion species used to reach up to 2.50 meters long and lived in Europe. It is part of the oldest extinct feline fossils found in the world.\nAmerican lion\nPanthera leo atrox, also known as the American lion, was distributed throughout North America. Many believe this occured when it arrived through the Bering Strait before the continental drift occurred. Additionally, records imply that the American lion may have been the largest lion species in history, having measured almost 4 meters in length, at a weight of between 350 and 400 kilos. According to cave paintings found, this subspecies lacked a mane or was very scarce. It disappeared during the mass megafauna extinction, which occurred in the Quaternary.\nExtinct lion species\nAdditional varieties of extinct lions include: Beringian cave lion (Panthera leo vereshchagini)\nSri Lankan lion (Panthera leo sinhaleyus)\nEuropean lion (Panthera leo europaea) For more, we recommend reading our article of extinct species of cat.\nIf you want to read similar articles to How Many Types of Lions Are There?, we recommend you visit our Facts about the animal kingdom category.\nBibliography"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion | Lion Facts and Information", "url": "https://targetstudy.com/nature/animals/lion.html", "text": "Lion\nLion is a member of the cat family and is counted amongst the 'Big Cats'. Lions are strong carnivorous animals known for their ferocity and courage. Lions evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago. From there they spread throughout the northern continents of the world, almost upper half on the world map. About 700,000 years ago, they appeared in Europe with the subspecies 'Panthera leo fossilis' at Isernia in Italy. And about 300,000 years ago Cave Lion (Panthera leo spelaea) evolved from the subspecies. During the upper Pleistocene the lion spread to North and South America, and developed into 'Panthera leo atrox', the American Lion. However, these species died out in northern Eurasia and America at the end of the last glaciation, about 10,000 years ago. Today, the majority of Lion population is concentrated in the continent of Africa and in Gir, India. There aren't any accurate numbers of lion population worldwide but estimates suggest numbers between 30,000-100,000.\nAs per scientific classification there are 7 accepted sub-species of lions recognized, out of which 2 are extinct.\nThey are:\nAngola Lion (P.l. bleyenberghi) - Found in Zimbabwe, Angola and Zaire. Masai Lion (P.l. massaicus) - Found in eastern Africa (i.e. Kenya and Tanzania). Senegalese Lion (P.l. senegalensis) - Found in western Africa. Transvaal or South African Lion (P.l. krugeri) - Found in Transvaal and Kalahari (South Africa). Asiatic Lion (P.l. persica) - Found only in the Gir Forest of North West India. Cape Lion (P.l. melanochaitus) - Found from the Cape Province to Natal (South Africa). It went extinct by 1860 Barbary Lion (P.l. leo) - Found in Northern Africa. It went extinct in the wild by 1920.\nFacts about Lions\nLions are the only social cats in the world. They live in groups, which are called 'Prides'. Pride size may vary from 3 to 40 members including adult females, males and cubs. All females in a pride are related.\nWhen lactating, females will allow any cub in their pride to nurse.\nLions are the only sexually dimorphic members of the cat family. It means that female and male look different. Lions have manes, lioness's don't.\nLions are the only Felids who have tufts at the ends of their tails, known as 'Tasselled Tails'. This tail is not for just looks alone, it is used as a means of communication. Lions use their Tasselled Tails to signal other members of the pride, with various messages which range from giving directions, showing attraction, curiosity, welcome etc.\nLion's claws are retractable and sharp. Their claws grow as a series of layers. These eventually shred to expose new claws that can reach lengths of up to 1 1/2 inches from the base to tip.\nA Lion can't actually roar until it's 2 years old. A lion's roar can be heard up to 5 miles away (8 kilometres). Lions have more than 10 other vocalisations apart from roar, these include: growl, meow, grunt and a puff (used in close situations).\nLions are known for their long spells of sleep. They spend most of their time sleeping, on an average they sleep for 16-20 hours per day.\nOn an average, a lion will eat around 40 pounds of meat in one sitting. Eating is always followed by long hours of sleep.\nOn an average a Lion spends 2 hours, a day walking and spends 50 minutes in eating.\nLions can go without food for more than a week.\nLions swallow their food in large chunks, instead of actually chewing and the swallowing it. They use only one side of their mouth at a time to cut their food. Their back teeth, known as 'Carnassals' work like a pair of scissors which help in tearing the flesh.\nLions are the only cats that habitually feed whilst lying on their bellies.\nMale lions patrol a vast territory normally covering about 100 square miles (260 square kilometres).\nA lion can run up to a maximum speed of 80 kilometres per hour, but it can maintain this speed only for short distances (100 metres).\nLions are poor hunters. Only 1 in 5 attempts is successful.\nLions can copulate up to as many as 100 times in a 24 hour period.\nLions generally hunt when the light is dull i.e. dawn or night but in Duba Plains of Botswana, lions only hunt during daylight for reasons better known to nature.\nIn the wild lions seldom live more than 8 to 10 years, In captivity they may live up to 20.\nLion Scientific Classification\nKingdom - Animalia.\nPhylum - Chordata.\nClass - Mammalia.\nOrder - Carnivora.\nFamily - Felidae.\nGenus - Panthera.\nSpecies - Panthera Leo (binomial name).\nLion: Physical Features\nWeight - Male lions weigh from 330 pounds (150 Kg) to 550 pounds (250 Kg). Females weigh 265 pounds (120 Kg) to 395 pounds (180 Kg).\nHeight and Length - Lions stand between 3\u00bd to 4 feet (48 inches) tall at the shoulder. Male lions grow larger than females, reaching up to10 feet long including the tail. Females reach up to 9 feet long. The tail is on average 1 metre in length.\nLion's body is very muscular, with less bone mass than other animals of comparable size. It has powerful shoulders and chest muscles allowing it to deliver strong blows with its forepaws which are heavy enough to break it's prey's back. The bones of the front legs are twisted in such a manner as to give a great range of motion to the forelimb.\nThe most distinctive physical feature of a Lion is it's Mane. The mane covers the backside of the head, and the shoulders. The mane hair is stiff and wiry, like stiff horsehair. The colour of the male's mane varies from blond to black, generally becoming darker as the lion grows older. The extent of the mane varies from individual to individual. Some may have no mane at all while others have a lush mane that runs along the abdomen and even onto the fronts of the back legs in exceptional cases. Just like the body hair, the mane colour is determined by the ratio of dark hairs to light hairs present. Some lions in the Serengeti area and from North Africa have a nearly black mane. The mane is a mean to display domination as the mane makes the lion appear larger. The mane also protects it from injuries during a fight. A dark and full mane indicates a healthy lion. It is has been also observed that lioness\u2019s favour males with the densest, darkest mane.\nCubs have light spotting on their coats that disappear as they grow up. Faded leopard spots can also be found on young lions and some females may retain these, which indicate that the lion once lived in a more forested habitat.\nLions paws are equipped with soft pads which enable them to walk silently. Lions are Digitigrades. This means they essentially walk on their toes. But, the majority of the animal's weight is borne by the main paw pads. Extra bones in the toe joints give the toes a wide range of motion. The retractable claws prevents injury during play and keeps the claws sharp. The dewclaw on the front limbs is often used as a toothpick.\nLions have large eyes which are proportionately larger than other comparable-sized animals. Their eyes contain a special reflective coating that will reflect even moonlight. It increases the lion's visual acuity in very low light by ensuring that every possible photon of light makes it to the cells in the retina. Their side-to-side eye movement is restricted and as such must turn the head to look in a different direction.\nThe lion's teeth are well adapted for killing their prey and eating it. The great canine teeth are spaced such that they can slip between the cervical vertebrae of their favourite-sized prey animals, and sever the spinal cord. The jaw is not capable of moving side-to-side, like humans.\nThe tongue of a lion is covered with rough spines, called Papillae. The Papillae is helpful in scraping meat off of bones and acts like a comb when grooming.\nLions have well developed sense of smell is well developed. It has a special olfactory organ on the roof of the mouth called a Jacobson's organ. Sometimes a lion will make a grimacing face whilst smelling. It's done by opening the lips and drawing air over their Jacobson\u2019s organ. This process is known 'Flehmen'.\nA lion can swivel it's ears over a wide angle to enable it to hear distant sounds and know what direction they are coming from.\nThe tail is about half the length of the body.\nA lion's body temperature ranges from 100.5 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. (38.05 - 39.16 degrees C.\nThe digestive system of the lion is simple, in fact they have the shortest digestive tracts of all animals.\nColour Variations\nLion colouration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish, or dark ochraceous brown\nApart from the above coloration, there is a distinct colouration, White Lions. White Lions are not a subspecies but have a genetic condition, known as \u2018Leucism\u2019. Though it causes the colour to pale, it is not Albinism as they have normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. Officially known as White Transvaal lion (Panthera leo krugeri), it is mostly found in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa. They are more common in captivity where breeders deliberately select them.\nCoat patter and colouration may exist as a result of breeding Lion with other Big Cats. Liger is one such hybrid which is a result of male lion and female tiger. Ligers have a tiger-like striping pattern with a lion-like tawny background. They may inherit rosettes from the lion parent.\nSimilarly, Leopon, a cross between a male leopard with a lioness has brown, rather than black, spots and tufted tails. Male leopons may have sparse manes.\nGeographical Range and Habitat\nAfrican lions habitat ranges from the Sahara's southern fringe to northern South Africa. They are not found in equatorial areas dominated by moist tropical forest.\nAsiatic Lion is only found in the dry Gir Forest of north-west India. A typical lion habitat is found in Savannah's, grasslands, dense bush and woodlands. However, they have adapted themselves to swampy areas and deserts. Like the lions found in the Kalahari Desert and Okavango Deltas lions\nBehaviour\nLions are highly social animals. Often a pride is headed by a coalition of two brothers and at times of unrelated lions. Upon reaching adulthood female cubs may stay with the pride. But at the age of about 3, males are forced to leave or disperse on their own for new grounds. They become nomads and try to form a pride of their own, where ever they can challenge the dominant male and take over. Some adult males remain nomads for life.\nLions are aggressive and very territorial. Lions proclaim their territory by roaring. They generally roar in the evening before a night\u2019s hunting and again before getting up at dawn. They also use roaring as a means of communication amongst each other. They use claw marking trees, rubbing their cheeks/jaws on objects, defecating and urinating on surroundings to mark their territory. This process is also meant to ward off competition, effectively reproduce and in some cases even hide their own scent. Male lions live a very violent life, they have a pride and territory to protect. On an average a male lion dominates a pride for about 3-4 years before it is challenged by other lions. Such challenges often result in death of either party. Upon dethroning the dominant male, the new lions will kill all siblings of the pride and terrorize the females. This killing has a purpose, female lions only give birth once every two years. With cubs by their side, they will not mate. Males also have limited period of time to pass on their genes so such infanticide occurs.\nWhile the lions come and go, females stay together for many years. In this way Lionesses are the backbone of the pride. They do most of the hunting and raise the family. Females will not tolerate a nomad lioness or a lioness who has lost her way, they will attack them and kill them. Female lions will also join a fight when their pride is attacked by other pride members. They will also join a male lion in defending the territory whenever the situation arises. Sometimes in a pride vs. pride situation, they may mistake one of their own as their enemy and it may lead to serious consequences.\nLions do not tolerate other predatory animals in their territory. A chance encounter with a leopard, cheetah, hyena or other small carnivores are dispatched as soon as they are see. They will also their young ones'. This is done to decrease competition for food. Lions will also steal kills from hyenas, leopards, and other predators, but may also lose their catches to hyena groups. Lions may also feed on domestic livestock, especially in areas near village. Lions tend to have enmity with spotted hyenas. There is a tussle between lions and hyenas over prey and territory. There have been documentation of hyenas purposely picking up a fight with lions. Some particular male lions have a great disliking for them and they will kill them even if unprovoked.\nFemales, whether nomad or in a pride do most of the hunting. Males are capable of hunting but they tend to participate only when the prey is larger for females to handle, like wild buffalo or giraffe. Males actively hunt during their bachelor stage. Lionesses work in a coalition though the actual bringing down of the prey is done by one of the 2-3 stronger and aggressive ones. The less strong one's help in overcoming and killing the prey. They stalk prey from nearby cover and then burst forth to run it down in a short, rapid rush. After leaping on the prey, the lion lunges at its neck and bites until the animal has been strangled or suffocated. They either bite the underside of the neck to collapse the trachea or they put their entire mouth over the prey animal's nose.\nWhen the hunt is over, pride males get to eat first if they are nearby. Upon the arrival of male, the females keep a considerable distance from the prey as the male can attack or maim them. The females wait for males to eat his fill first but if she is wants to eat, she will approach carefully and try to mollify him with some social greeting and flirting. Cubs are usually a bit more tolerated by the male, but even they risk pushing too far. All those feasting will try to grab as much as they can for themselves in a pretty direct competition with the other lions. All in all it is a squabble.\nLions eat about 5 to 7 kgs meat daily, but can consume about 25% of their body mass if necessary. Though African Lions kill only enough to sustain themselves, but sometimes they kill excessively in the case of prey animals that are weak or young lions that go berserk.\nLions communicate with each other through a rub. The act is meant as a means of bonding, as lions leave scent markings on each other during the process.\nHumans are not natural prey of Lions. But there have been incidents of man eaters. The most well known man-eaters have been the 'Tsavo Lions'. During March 1898 the Britishers had started the construction of a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya. Over a period of 9 months a pair male lions killed 28 railway workers. These were larger than normal lions and lacked manes. The absence or lack of prey led to such an incident. Man-eating however can become hereditary, as was the case with the Tanzania Lions. During 1930s over three generations of lions have been considered to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 in Njombe district (the known as Tanganyika).\nLion: Diet\nLions diet consist of various small and large animals. Typical diet of a Lion consists of zebra, wildebeest, impala, warthog, hartebeest, baboons, wild buffalo, oryx, eland and waterbuck. They are opportunistic hunters and will kill young hippopotamus, young sub-adult elephants, young rhinoceros, giraffes, ostriches and other small animals. In rare cases they have been documented killing a crocodile as well. They will also eat any meat they can find, including carrion and fresh kills that they scavenge or forcefully steal from hyenas, cheetahs, leopards or wild dogs.\nPredators\nLions do not have any predators. However, some lions may end up dead whilst dealing with a large animal or a group of animals. Wild Buffalo, Hippopotamus, Rhinoceros, Elephants, Hyenas, Crocodile are formidable opponents. Cubs may fall prey to other competitive carnivorous and herbivore animals.\nLion: Reproduction\nMale lions reach maturity at about 3-4 years of age. Lions are polygamous and breed throughout the year. But females are usually restricted to the one or two adult males of their pride. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat. Lion Mating begins with growling, pawing and even biting. When the female is ready, she lies down, and the male mounts her. Actual copulation takes 6-10 seconds, after which time the male gently bites the female's neck. The female then turns and bares her teeth at the male. The female does not ovulate until she is stimulated to do so by lots of sex. As a result lions will mate roughly every 15 to 20 minutes for two or three days\u2014200 to 300 times in succession. During that period they are inseparable and will not hunt or eat. Gestation takes about 105-108 days. Usually two or three cubs are born. Newborn lion cubs are helpless and blind and have a thick coat with dark spots that usually disappear with maturity. Cubs are able to follow their mothers at about three months of age and are weaned by six or seven months. They begin participating in kills by 11 months but become able hunters when they are 2-3 years old."}

Prey populations, like deer, can quickly escalate when predators die out. This increases disease, and damages the plant life in an ecosystem.\n\u2013 Large predators \u2013 like cougars, wolves, and bears \u2013 are an important part of the ecosystem. Prey populations, like deer, can quickly escalate when predators die out. This increases disease, and damages the plant life in an ecosystem. Artificial Control \u2013 Though recreational hunting of deer and other large game helps reduce populations, it is far from a perfect system. When hunting for sport, humans target the largest, strongest, animals. However, this is bad for the genetics of the population. Natural predators, like cougars, are important because they pick off the weak and the sick. When only the strongest survive to reproduce, the population is healthier.\nHabitat of the Mountain Lion\nMountain lions are kings of adaptability. Part of the reason they have such a wide range is because of their ability to adapt to different habitats. You can find these predators in nearly every North American habitat. They live in deserts, mountains, lowlands, mangrove forests, deciduous forests, canyons, prairies, and more. When given the opportunity, their preferred habitats have rocky outcrops or dense vegetation to ambush prey from.\nDistribution of the Mountain Lion\nThese widespread cats have one of the largest ranges of any terrestrial animal in North and South America. From Canada, populations of mountain lions live all the way to the tip of South America. Their range stretches from Canada all the way to South America.\nThe northernmost reach of their range is the Canadian Yukon. In North America, they are more concentrated to the western states. Save for Florida, humans have removed them from the vast majority of the eastern United States and Canada.\nDiet of the Mountain Lion\nLike most cats, cougars are obligate carnivores. This means that they must eat meat to survive, and the vast majority of their diet consists of meat. To capture enough prey to survive, these cats must be opportunistic. They prey on anything from insects and rabbits, to 1,500 lb. bull moose. Some commonly targeted species include deer, elk, moose, bighorn sheep, horse, pronghorn, mountain goat, and caribou.\nMountain Lion and Human Interaction\nInteractions between mountain lions and humans negatively impact both. On one hand, the cats will sometimes attack livestock, and even humans. On the other hand, humans kill mountain lions for a number of reasons.\nIn some areas, hunting these cats is legal, and in other areas, more indirect factors impact them. Deforestation and habitat destruction pose a problem, because these cats thrive in areas where they can ambush their prey. Though the population is stable, some regional subspecies are endangered or extinct.\nDomestication\nHumans have not domesticated mountain lions in any way.\nDoes the Mountain Lion Make a Good Pet\nNo, mountain lions do not make good pets. Large, toothy predators tend to be dangerous as household pets! It is also illegal in most places to own one of these cats as a pet.\nMountain Lion Care\nIn zoos, these cats can nearly double their life expectancy. While wild cougars usually have a 10-year lifespan at the most, those in zoos can live to 20 years or more. This is because zookeepers provide them with a reliable food source, and unlimited healthcare.\nZoos have commercially available ground meat, which provides all the vitamins and nutrients needed for survival. Additionally, they receive rabbits, large bones, and parts of carcasses. The exhibits built for these cats are spacious, and usually provide a number of rocky features or climbing opportunities.\nBehavior of the Mountain Lion\nMountain lions are solitary creatures, and outside of mating, adults rarely interact. However, individuals with bordering territories will occasionally share kills. An animal that shares a kill with its neighbor increases the likelihood the neighbor will share a kill in return. They mark territories with urine and claw scraping, and these territories can vary greatly in size based on food abundance.\nReproduction of the Mountain Lion\nFemale mountain lions will usually only reproduce once every two or three years. The gestation period is approximately three months, and the female takes the sole responsibility of rearing the young. Litters of two kittens are the most common.\nWhen they are born, the kittens are blind and helpless. By the time they are three months old, the kittens will begin to eat meat and stop drinking milk. Once they are six months old, the kittens will begin to hunt their own prey. They will hone their skills, and remain with their mother, for at least two years before setting off on their own.\nBeliefs, Superstitions, and Phobias About the Mountain Lion\nThe indigenous people of North, Central, and South America, revere and respect these powerful cats. Various native people have stories and mythology relating to mountain lions, from the Cherokee to the Incan people. In some regions they considered the cat a harbinger of death, while in others they regarded it as a deity or sacred animal."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Roarsome Facts About The Barbary Lion", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/barbary-lion-facts", "text": "Barbary Lion Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is a Barbary lion?\nA Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) is a species of lion. These majestic cats are extinct in the wild now, but they used to be found in the wooded highlands of North Africa. The Barbary lion has a long and glorious existence, they were even housed in the menagerie at the Tower of London, as these magnificent lions were prime attractions at luxury British hotels.\nWhat class of animal does a Barbary lion belong to?\nThe Barbary lion belongs to the class Mammalia. Their original scientific name was Felis leo, but later on, in 1930, it became a member of the Panthera genus. Thus in 2005, it was finally named Panthera leo leo.\nHow many Barbary lions are there in the world?\nThere are less than 100 Barbary lions currently in the world. The Barbary lion population has declined gradually over the 19th century, especially in Morocco.\nWhere does a Barbary lion live?\nThe Barbary lion (extinct in the wild now) was prevalent in Northern Africa. The Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) vanished entirely in the early 18th century apart from a stray population in the Atlas mountains (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia). Due to the lack of moisture on the eastern side of their native region, their population was scarce. Also, until around 1884, these lions roamed Chelia's cedar forests and Algeria's surrounding mountains.\nWhat is a Barbary lion's habitat?\nThe typical Barbary lion habitat was found in the green and wooded highlands of North Africa. Some of these lions also lived in sub-Saharan habitats. Hunting in a group was commonly witnessed among these lions. Because of the colder temperature in the Atlas Mountains during winter, Barbary lion males developed long-haired manes.\nWho do Barbary lions live with?\nBarbary lions of Northern Africa used to live alone or with a mate and cubs. They used to often bump into the African leopard and the Atlas bear but didn't live with these animals as they were competing predators in the region. Today these lions living in zoos often have a mate to breed with.\nHow long does a Barbary lion live?\nA Barbary lion's life span is 12-15 years\nHow do they reproduce?\nBarbary lions used to breed in the month of January and their gestation period lasts for 110 days. These African lions give birth to two to six cubs at a time on average. The cubs of a wild Barbary lion had an average weight of 3.3-3.7 lb (1.5-1.7 kg) and these cubs could open their eyes six days after birth and were able to walk only after 12-13 days! Wild cubs used to stay with their mothers up to the age of two.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nBarbary lions of Northern Africa are extinct in the wild as per the IUCN's Red List. Barbary lion populations dropped dramatically by the middle of the 19th century and the suffering of this cat was worsened by deforestation and the scarcity of food. In 1942, in Morocco, the last Barbary lion was shot by a French hunter but, until the '50s, this lion sub-species was frequently spotted in Algeria and Morocco. The rest of their population is assumed to have lasted until the '60s. This lion sub-species' genes are most probably present in many lions housed in zoos across Europe and North America. many zoos also are part of a global breeding program working towards the continued survival of Barbary lions. Conservationists hope and believe that Barbary lion reintroduction to North Africa can be achieved but it will take extensive planning and a lot of hard work.\nBarbary Lion Fun Facts\nWhat do Barbary lions look like?\nThese North African lions are large in size and are often described as the largest sub-species of lions. The Barbary lion characteristics that stand out are their bold manes, their large body, and their warm colors. The color of a wild Barbary lion ranges from dark to light tawny and this magnificent cat has a big mane. Barbary lion manes reach to their elbows and stretch above their shoulder and beneath their belly. Their mane hair is between 3.1-8.7 in (8-22 cm) long, and females do not possess these manes. This cat's head-to-tail length range is 7.9-8.5 ft (2.4-2.5 m) and it stands tall, as high as 3.2-3.9 ft (1-1.2 m).\n* Please note that this is an image of a lion, not a Barbary lion specifically. If you have an image of a Barbary lion please let us know at [email protected]\nHow cute are they?\nThese tawny Barbary lions are royal lions who have shaggy manes and strong, muscular bodies. From afar, these powerful beasts are big, fierce, and golden creatures.\nHow do they communicate?\nThe Atlas lion communicates through its stealthy body movements as well as its loud, powerful, and deep roar. Each roar implies a different meaning. The lioness and lion also lick, purr and gnaw at each other.\nHow big is a Barbary lion?\nThe average Barbary lion size is huge. The head-to-tail length of an Atlas lion is 7.9-8.5 ft (2.4-2.5 m) and they can reach a height of 3.2-3.9 ft (1-1.2 m). The manes of these lions alone have a length range of 3.1-8.7 in (8-22 cm). They are three times the size of an average dog.\nHow fast can a Barbary lion run?\nThe Barbary lion of Northern Africa has a top speed of 49.7 mph (79.9 kph).\nHow much does a Barbary lion weigh?\nThe Barbary lion weight range is between 551-661 lb (250-300 kg).\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nMales are known as Barbary lions whereas the females are known as Barbary lionesses.\nWhat would you call a baby Barbary lion?\nBabies of the Barbary lion are called cubs.\nWhat do they eat?\nTheir techniques of hunting were never adequately studied, although they are known to have strangulated their prey to kill it. This lion subspecies used to feed on large mammals such as deer, stags, wild boar, and gazelles in the Atlas mountains. Cheetas and hyenas were the lion's natural enemies and they were often found fighting with each other for food.\nAre they dangerous?\nThis lion subspecies is quite dangerous and aggressive. They are fierce and powerful cats that are quick on their toes and they can prey upon humans if provoked.\nWould they make a good pet?\nNo, these are wild cats and would definitely not make good pets.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nThe Romans used Barbery lions in the Colosseum for entertainment!\nBarbary lions that were kept in captivity in the Tower of London, were presented to the royal families of Morocco and Ethiopia as presents! When the royal family went into exile, they divided the royal lions among zoos.\nBarbary lions were housed in circuses and hotels in the 19th century.\nBarbary lion vs. lion\nWide dark manes are one of the main characteristics of Barbary lions that makes them stand out from other lions. Their skull-to-body ratio is also significantly higher than that of other lion populations, indicating that they have wider heads.\nBarbary lion vs African lion\nBarbary lions weigh between 551-661 lb (250-300 kg), whereas an African lion weighs on average 400 lb (181 kg), with the female weighing on average 275 lb (125 kg). The arms of Barbary lions are also shorter and their torsos are more sturdy and powerful\nBarbary lion vs. Siberian tiger\nThe Barbary lion measures between 551-661 lb (250-300 kg), while the Siberian tiger is the largest of the tiger subspecies, weighing roughly 847 lb (384 kg). As well as being heavier, the Siberian tiger is also physically superior to the lion as it is much more powerful and quicker, tougher, and wiser. This species also possesses the biggest canines in the cat family. Whilst a Barbary lion could kill some tigers, in a fight against these Siberian tigers, these royal lions would probably lose.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

They\u2019re sea lions, an amphibious species of marine mammals. Sea lions can survive in disparate climates and have well-developed social structures that often mimic that of humans. In some locations, like New Zealand, sea lions make the list of largest regional animals.\nFour Amazing Sea Lion Facts\nSix Subspecies: Currently, there are six subspecies of sea lions: Australia sea lions, California sea lions, Galapagos sea lions, New Zealand sea lions, South American sea lions, and Steller sea lions.\nSmart Sea Lions: Sea lions are smart. They understand rudimentary sign language, and some even serve in the United States Navy to help with counterespionage missions!\nSubspecies Extinction: In the not too distant past, seven subspecies of sea lions glided through the world\u2019s waters. Unfortunately, the Japanese sea lion went extinct in the 1950s due to overhunting and commercial fishing.\nBig and Small Cousins: Sea lions are marine mammals and close cousins with walruses and seals.\nSea Lion Taxonomy: Scientific Names and Meanings\nCommon-Use Language Roots\nThere are six subspecies of sea lions, all with different scientific names. As you\u2019ve probably guessed, their common-use name means \u201clion of the sea,\u201d but what do they have in common with their land-dwelling namesakes? In short, both lions and sea lions sport manes and roar loudly.\nThe word \u201clion\u201d comes to the Modern English language through several linguistic streams, including Old French and Latin. Its Greek linguistic roots are connected to a Spartan king named Leonidas.\nScientific Name for Sea Lions\nAll sea lions belong to the taxonomic family of Otariidae, which means \u201clittle ear.\u201d Currently, 13 Otariidae species are roaming the planet, including sea lions.\nBelow are the scientific names for the six subspecies of sea lions.\nAustralian Sea Lions \u2013 The Scientific name for Australian sea lions is Neophoca cinerea. Sometimes, the name is styled \u201cAustralian sealion\u201d and \u201cAustralian sea-lion.\u201d\nCalifornia Sea Lions \u2013 The scientific name for California sea lions is Zalophus californianus. Zalophus comes to us from Greek and translates to \u201cintensive crest.\u201d Californianus reflects the region of the world in which most of the species live. Ren\u00e9 Primev\u00e8re Lesson first described the species in 1828.\nGalapagos Sea Lions \u2013 The scientific name for Galapagos sea lions is Zalophus wollebaeki. Zalophus is derived from Greek and translates to \u201cintensive crest.\u201d E. Sivertsen first described the subspecies in 1953.\nNew Zealand Sea Lions \u2013 The Scientific name for New Zealand sea lions is Phocarctos hookeri. They\u2019re also known as \u201cwhakahao\u201d and \u201ckautakoa\u201d in the indigenous M\u0101ori language. Hookeri is in honor of several notable naturalists, including Joseph Dalton Hooker or William Jackson Hooker.\nSteller Sea Lions \u2013 The scientific name for Steller sea lions is Eumetopias jubatus. Eumetopias translates to \u201cbroad forehead,\u201d and jubatus means \u201cmane.\u201d Indigenous language speakers in Australia call sea lions either \u201cmawak\u201d or \u201ctl\u2019ixin.\u201d Steller comes from Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist who first described the animal in 1741. Occasionally, they\u2019re referred to as \u201cnorthern sea lions.\u201d\nSouth American Sea Lions \u2013 The scientific name for South American sea lions is Otaria flavescens. Otaria derives from Otariidae, which means \u201clittle ear,\u201d and flavescens is Latin for \u201cbecoming yellow.\u201d They are also known as \u201cPatagonian sea lions\u201d and \u201csouthern sea lions.\u201d In Spanish, South American sea lions go by \u201clobo marino\u201d and \u201cleon marino.\u201d\nSea Lion: Appearance and Behavior\nSea lions look a lot like seals. However, unlike seals, they have ear flaps.\nThough all sea lions are equipped with similar skeletal structures and four flippers, which double as feet when on land, their sizes and colors vary among subspecies. All sea lions have coarse, short fur, and the males of each subspecies have manes of varying lengths. Additionally, they\u2019re equipped with five claws on each front flipper that they use for hunting and gripping when on land.\nSea lions have between 34 and 38 teeth, depending on the subspecies and sex. Incisors, canines, premolars, and molars make up sea lions teeth structures. Baby sea lions develop milk teeth in the womb but shed them before they\u2019re born.\nSea lions are the second largest species of otariids, and some subspecies can reach 10 feet long, which is about as long as one-and-a-half king-sized beds. Walruses are the only other otariids that best sea lions in size.\nAustralian Sea Lions \u2013 Female Australian sea lions are either silver- or fawn-colored with a cream underbelly. Males are dark brown with yellow manes. Males grow to about 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) and weigh about 300 kilograms (661 pounds). Females are a bit smaller, usually weighing in at about 105 kilograms (231 pounds) with a length of approximately 1.8 meters (5.9 feet).\nCalifornia Sea Lions- Male California sea lions coloring ranges from light brown to black. Females\u2019 fur is usually a tawny brown. Baby California sea lions are dark brown at birth. In terms of size, males, on average, are 2.4 meters (7.9 feet) long, and females are 1.8 meters (5.9 feet). Males weigh about 350 kilograms (770 pounds) and females 100 kilograms (220 pounds).\nMale California sea lions have barely visible manes and high-domed foreheads.\nGalapagos Sea Lions \u2013 Galapagos sea lions range in length from 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet), and males are typically larger than females. Weight-wise, they tip the scales between 50 and 250 kilograms (110 and 550 pounds). Galapagos sea lions are distinguishable by their pointy, whiskered noses and long, narrow muzzles. Galapagos sea lions are the smallest subspecies of the animal.\nNew Zealand Sea Lions \u2013 New Zealand sea lions are on the larger side of the species. Males typically weigh between 320 and 450 kilograms (710 and 990 pounds) and are between 240 and 350 centimeters (7.9 and 11.5 feet) long. Females are a tad tinier, with 180 to 200 centimeters (5.9 to 6.6 feet) of length.\nBabies are born with brown fur. Adult females sport creamy gray coats while males are black or brown with black manes.\nSteller Sea Lions \u2013 Steller sea lions have different coloring than the other subspecies and sport a lighter tawny or reddish fur. Babies, however, are born with very dark hair, which grows lighter after a few months. Female Steller sea lions are between 2.3 and 2.9 meters (7.5 and 9.5 feet) long. Males, on the other hand, are between 2.8 and 3.3 meters (9.3 and 10.7 feet). Females weigh between 240 and 350 kilograms; males are 450 to 1,120 kilograms (990 to 2,470 pounds). The males\u2019 manes are very thick.\nSteller sea lions are the largest subspecies of the animal.\nSouth American Sea Lions \u2013 Male South American sea lions grow up to 2.7 meters (9 feet) in length and weigh an average of 350 kilograms (770 pounds). Females are a bit smaller and usually grow to about 1.8 to 2 meters (6 to 7 feet) in length. They weigh about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) on average. Both males and females can be either orange or brown, and babies are born a greyish color. Males of the species have huge heads and large manes.\nSea lions are very smart, bursting with personality, and frolic with each other for hours \u2014 just like human children! California sea lions are the smartest subspecies, and you can often find them at aquatic centers and zoos doing tricks on command. Sea lions are so intelligent that the United States Navy trains and uses them in missions.\nThey typically live in groups, but the names for their groups depend on what they\u2019re doing. When sea lions are hanging out on land, they\u2019re called a \u201ccolony.\u201d When they\u2019re in the water, the proper term is \u201craft.\u201d During mating season, sea lions are called a \u201crookery.\u201d Since sea lions are polygynous, during mating season, the females in a given rook are referred to as a \u201charem.\u201d Sea lions feed and migrate in water, but breed and rest on land. In the non-mating season, male and female rafts generally go their separate ways, but all the pups stay with the female colonies and rafts.\nWhen sea lions transfer from water to land, it\u2019s called \u201chauling-out.\u201d And when they haul-out, they get loud and communicate through rhythmic barking, growling, and even belching! Amazingly, mothers and their babies can recognize each others\u2019 vocalizations, even in a pack of 30 or more howling sea lions.\nSea lions are also great divers and can stay underwater for up to nine minutes at a time. Even more impressively, they can dive to great depths. The deepest recorded seal dive was 274 meters (900 ft)!\nSea lions are generally docile and playful, except during mating season. And though aggression with humans is exceptionally rare, it does happen.\nSea Lion Habitat\nSea lions live in a variety of climates in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The Atlantic Ocean is the only major ocean without sea lions. Being amphibious \u2014 meaning they live part-time on land and part-time in water \u2014 sea lions stick to coastal regions. Plus, coastal areas usually have better food sources.\nAustralian Sea Lions \u2013 Australian sea lions can be found on the south and west coasts of Australian, especially around the Houtman Abrolhos Islands in Western Australian and the Pages islands in southern Australia.\nCalifornia Sea Lions \u2013 California sea lions make their homes in the Pacific Ocean, from Alaska down to Mexico. Comfortable with humans, California sea lions will haul-out on human-made marinas and piers.\nGalapagos Sea Lions \u2013 As their name suggests, Galapagos sea lions call the Galapagos Islands home, and they only breed in that region, including Isla de la Plata, another area landmass. Galapagos sea lions are graceful and playful and dazzle tourists who visit the famed lands. They\u2019re so gregarious that locals consider them the islands\u2019 official \u201cwelcoming party.\u201d\nNew Zealand Sea Lions \u2013 New Zealand sea lions congregate the sub-antarctic islands, including Auckland and Campbell Islands, in addition to the South and Stewart Islands.\nSteller Sea Lions \u2013 Steller sea lions inhabit the North Pacific Ocean and can be found off coasts in Russia, Alaska, and central California. A more solitary subspecies, Steller sea lions seem to prefer isolated locales.\nSouth American Sea Lions \u2013 Southern sea lions stick to the west coast of South America off the shores of Ecuador, Peru, Chile, the Falkland Islands, Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil.\nSea Lion Diet\nSea lions are primarily carnivores, meaning they eat mostly meat. However, they occasionally dine on marine plant life and seaweed. Some species of sea lions are so smart that they coordinate with dolphins, porpoises, and seabirds for large-pack hunts.\nBelow is a chart outlining the different species of fish and other fowl on which each sea lion subspecies feeds.\nSea Lion SubspeciesDietAustralian sea lionsteleast, squid, cuttlefish, octopus, sharks, rock lobster, penguins, crustaceansCalifornia sea lionssalmon, hake, Pacific whiting, anchovies, herring, rockfish, lamprey, dogfish, squid, clamsGalapagos sea lionssardines, yellowfin tunaNew Zealand sea lionsAntarctic horsefish, Patagonian toothfish, squid, octopus, seabirds, crustaceans, fur sealsSteller Sea Lionswalleye, pollock, Atka mackerel, halibut, herring, capelin, flatfish, Pacific cod, rockfish, sculpins, salmon, squid, octopusSouth American sea lionshake, anchovies, squid, octopus, penguins, pelicans, baby American fur seals\nSea Lion Predators and Threats\nIn the past, humans hunted sea lions for meat, hides, and blubber. In the 1800s, you could buy Steller sea lion whiskers for a penny each, and people used them as pipe cleaners. Today, some native communities are still allowed to hunt sea lions for sustenance purposes.\nDisease and human encroachment threaten sea lion populations, in addition to food stress and natural predators. Fishing nets prove especially fatal to sea lions, as they get tangled in their webs and thrash about in an attempt to get loose. However, since the nets stay submerged underwater for long periods, the sea lions often can\u2019t escape in time and drown. Fishing hooks present another danger to the marine mammals.\nCurrently, teams of specialists are studying ways to develop human communities along coasts that nourish the surrounding biodiversity, including sea lions.\nGreat white sharks and killer whales are natural predators of sea lions. The Galapagos subspecies must also worry about stray dog packs.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, a cyclical warming of the Pacific Ocean, has also proved devastating for sea lions, as it greatly diminishes their food supplies and increases diseases.\nSea Lion Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nBreeding season for sea lions is subspecies dependent, but all have a gestation period of about 12 months. Below is a chart outlining the mating seasons, breeding habitats, and average lifespans for each type.\nNote that all sea lions live longer in captivity. The age ranges listed below apply to wild animals. Additionally, all sea lions are polygynous, meaning one male will mate with many females, but females typically only mate with one male.\nArguably like humans, males make an effort to secure the best rookery \u2014 or mating spot \u2014 to attract females. The best breeding habitats have safe access to nearby water and a pupping area, where the young ones \u2014 or pups \u2014 can be safeguarded from predators. Males left empty-handed retreat to a \u201cbachelor colony\u201d where they beef up in the hopes of better luck in the future.\nDepending on the subspecies, sea lions breed on either rocky coasts or sandy beaches. Females of the species, or cows, typically have one child, or pup, at a time. Very rarely, a cow will birth twins. In most instances, the ladies perform their deliveries on land, but some have been known to do it in water. Mothers produce milk and, depending on the subspecies, will nurse their offspring for 6 to 12 months. Swimming and hunting lessons start at around 2 to 3 months old.\nSubspecies Mating Season Breeding and Nurturing Habitats Average Lifespans Australian sea lions Mating season for Australian sea lion isn\u2019t fixed and can last up to nine months. Cows raise and nurture their pups for about three years. Females also take turns babysitting each others\u2019 pups while they go foraging for food. Also, females adopt the babies of cows who die. 25 years California sea lions May \u2013 August Females freely hop from territory to territory to find the one they like best and typically steer clear of overly aggressive males. They breed on both sand and rocky shores. 15 to 20 years Galapagos sea lions May \u2013 January Males must work to keep females in their rooks. Female Galapagos sea lions are very community-oriented and establish playgroups and babysitting schedules. 15 to 24 years New Zealand sea lions December \u2013 February New Zealand sea lions are territorial and work to keep cows in their rooks. 23 years Steller sea lions May \u2013 August Like California sea lions, females choose their mates and move freely between rookeries. 15 to 20 years South American sea lions August \u2013 December Males establish breeding territories and aggressively herd females. Males will even go so far as to kidnap pups to lure females into their harems. 20 years\nSea Lion Population\nSome species of sea lions are stable; others are not. California sea lions are the most populous subspecies, and New Zealand sea lions are endangered. Below is a table detailing the populations of each subspecies.\nSubspecies Estimated Population International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Status Other Population Classifications Australian sea lions 14,730 Endangered The Wildlife Conservation Act of Australia lists Stellers as \u201cin need of special protection.\u201d California sea lions 357,000 Least Concern The species is protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which outlaws hunting, capture and harassment. Galapagos sea lions 20,000 \u2013 50,000 Endangered Their habitat is part of the protected Ecuadorian National Park.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "lion - Reproduction and life cycle | Britannica", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/animal/lion/Reproduction-and-life-cycle", "text": "Reproduction and life cycle\nBoth sexes are polygamous and breed throughout the year, but females are usually restricted to the one or two adult males of their pride. In captivity lions often breed every year, but in the wild they usually breed no more than once in two years. Females are receptive to mating for three or four days within a widely variable reproductive cycle. During this time a pair generally mates every 20\u201330 minutes, with up to 50 copulations per 24 hours. Such extended copulation not only stimulates ovulation in the female but also secures paternity for the male by excluding other males. The gestation period is about 108 days, and the litter size varies from one to six cubs, two to four being usual.\nNewborn cubs are helpless and blind and have a thick coat with dark spots that usually disappear with maturity. Cubs are able to follow their mothers at about three months of age and are weaned by six or seven months. They begin participating in kills by 11 months but probably cannot survive on their own until they are two years old. Although lionesses will nurse cubs other than their own, they are surprisingly inattentive mothers and often leave their cubs alone for up to 24 hours. There is a corresponding high mortality rate (e.g., 86 percent in the Serengeti), but survival rates improve after the age of two. In the wild, sexual maturity is reached at three or four years of age. Some female cubs remain within the pride when they attain sexual maturity, but others are forced out and join other prides or wander as nomads. Male cubs are expelled from the pride at about three years of age and become nomads until they are old enough to try to take over another pride (after age five). Many adult males remain nomads for life. Mating opportunities for nomad males are rare, and competition between male lions to defend a pride\u2019s territory and mate with the pride females is fierce. Cooperating partnerships of two to four males are more successful at maintaining tenure with a pride than individuals, and larger coalitions father more surviving offspring per male. Small coalitions typically comprise related males, whereas larger groups often include unrelated individuals. If a new cohort of males is able to take over a pride, they will seek to kill young cubs sired by their predecessors. This has the effect of shortening the time before the cubs\u2019 mothers are ready to mate again. Females attempt to prevent this infanticide by hiding or directly defending their cubs; lionesses are generally more successful at protecting older cubs, as they would be leaving the pride sooner. In the wild lions seldom live more than 8 to 10 years, chiefly because of attacks by humans or other lions or the effects of kicks and gorings from intended prey animals. In captivity they may live 25 years or more."}

In each pride, there are almost one or two males and a large number of females, however, larger pride have around 40 members. The logic is very simple, life is quite easy in groups and it increases the chances of a successful hunt and can effectively provide protection of cubs. Let me list down some of the Interesting Lion Facts,\nInteresting Lion Facts\nLions are carnivorous animals and love to hunt on antelopes, zebras and wildebeests. Lioness is responsible for hunting though lions are strong and larger in size.\nThere are multiple scenarios where lions are acting like scavengers and they can even attack hyenas and steal their prey.\nLions can eat 40 pounds of meat and later snooze for more than 20 hours.\nLions back teeth is known as carnassials and they act like a pair of scissors that will chop meat and help them in swallowing without chewing.\nLions can be easily identified by their manes, the more dark and larger these \u201cmanes\u201d are will show the strength of lions and other lions often avoid him.

These lions are now found only in the Gir National Park, Gujrat, India.\nWhat class of animal does an Asiatic lion belong to?\nAsiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) are mammals that sit at the top of the food chain in forests. Due to reasons like hunting and forest fire, these Asian lions are now found in wild only in the Gir Forest of India.\nHow many Asiatic lions are there in the world?\nAsiatic lions are now only to be found in the Gir Forest which is a prominent National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary of Gujarat. There are appx 600 Asiatic lions left in the world and efforts for conservation of these wild lions are being conducted.\nWhere does an Asiatic lion live?\nAsiatic lions live in the Gir Forest which is the only wildlife sanctuary in the world where Asian lions can be found in the wild.\nWhat is an Asiatic lion's habitat?\nAsiatic lions are commonly found in the grassy scrublands of Gir Forest that spans across the South-western part of Saurashtra, Gujarat, or dry deserts of Madhya Pradesh. The environment where they dwell is relatively friendly so that they can hunt their prey and be exposed to water to drink and survive.\nWho do Asiatic lions live with?\nAsiatic lions live in Gir Forest by forming social groups called pride. In pride, there is one superior male, several lionesses, and other young lions. As per IUCN Red List, only a few hundred Asiatic lions live in the wild and that too only in the Gir Forest in Gujarat, India.\nHow long does an Asiatic lion live?\nThe average life span of an Asiatic lion is 16-18 years in the wild. These big cats live in small social units called prides which comprise of two adult females as compared to around four to six females in their African cousins.\nHow do they reproduce?\nAsian lions live in pride where usually there is one superior male, several lionesses, and other young lions, the superior male mates with her lioness. Lions can mate with more than one partner. After mating, the gestation period of about 110 days, a lioness gives birth to baby lions known as cubs. A lioness can give birth to one to four cubs at once.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nAs per the IUCN Red List, the conservation status of Asian lions is endangered. There are only 600 lions left in the world, primarily focused in India. Earlier the Asian lions were found across a wide geographical region including the middle-east but due to uncontrolled hunting, now only a small population of Asian lions is remaining in Gir Forest. Efforts for Asiatic lion conservation are being taken-up on the global level.\nAsiatic Lion Fun Facts\nWhat do Asiatic Lions look like?\nAsian lions are basically large wild cats, the most distinct feature of these lions is the longitudinal fold of their skin which runs along their belly. The ears of Asiatic lions are visible as they have a short, sparse, and dark mane while a male Asiatic lion will have a comparatively short, sparse and darker mane.\nHow cute are they?\nThe appearance of lions is actually cute, but because of their dangerous predatory skills, they are never looked at as cute creatures.\nHow do they communicate?\nIn order to communicate, lions roar, grunt, moans, growl, purr, puff, and woof, and they use their body language as well. Each gesture and sound made can have different meanings.\nHow big is an Asiatic lion?\nAn Asiatic lion is 2.92 m long, including its tail. The standing height of an Asiatic lion is around 1.7m . Although Asiatic lions are pretty big, they are still slightly smaller than African lions.\nHow fast can an Asiatic lion move?\nAsiatic lions are very fast runners. They can run at a speed of 50 mph. This high speed allows them to catch their prey with ease and can run for a long time. Their stamina is also impressive as they don\u2019t get tired soon.\nHow much does an Asiatic lion weigh?\nAn Asiatic lion weighs around 350-418 lb. Their huge body mass allows them to overpower their prey and can win any battle with other animals.\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nThe male lion is known as a lion, and the female lion is known as a lioness.\nWhat would you call a baby Asiatic lion?\nA baby Asiatic lion is called a cub. A cub stays with its mother until it grows up and is taken full care of its mother. These cubs are adorable to look at, but they grow to become dangerous animals in the wild.\nWhat do they eat?\nAsiatic lions are carnivores, and they prey on Gir Forest animals such as blue antelope, spotted deer, sambhar, cattle and buffaloes. Their power and might allow them to easily tackle any animal they want to feast upon.\nAre they dangerous?\nYes, Asiatic lions are strong and powerful enough to kill a human with no weapons. Asiatic lions are well known for their predatory skills. They can easily capture and kill their prey. But now Asiatic lions are themselves in danger of extinction because Asiatic lions were hunted by humans and this resulted in a heavy decline in their population which is now concentrated in the Gir Forest region of India.\nWould they make a good pet?\nA properly trained lion can be friendly with humans, but we can not neglect the fact that they are still carnivores and they might behave aggressively. So, if a lion is kept as a pet then the owner needs to be careful with the animal as their aggressive behavior can be fatal.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nAre Asiatic lions found in India only?\nYes, the Asiatic lions are now found in the Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary of Gujarat only.\nIs the Asiatic lion endangered?\nYes, the Asiatic lion is now an endangered species. The Asiatic lion population became endangered because lions were heavily hunted by humans. Many times humans hunted lions for fun and fame. Other reasons were forest fires, epidemics, and other unpredictable events that may happen in the wild.\nAsiatic lion VS. African lion\nAsiatic lions are slightly smaller than African lions. With a less developed mane, the ears of Asiatic lions are visible, while on the other hand, African lion has a larger and well-developed mane, and that's why their ears are not always visible.\nThe tail tuft of an Asiatic is larger than the African lion. A longitudinal fold of skin runs along the belly of Asiatic lions, while the African lions do not have such skinfold.\nAfrican lions live in larger pride, while Asiatic lions have smaller pride. Asiatic lions have bifurcated infraorbital foramina present in their skill, and this allows the blood and nerves to pass through the eyes. In contrast, the African lions have a single infraorbital foramen present.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

{"animal": "lion", "title": "8 Different Species Of Lions With Pictures - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/different-species-of-lions-with-pictures", "text": "Belonging to the Panthera genus and Felidae family, lions are majestic animals. The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) recognizes two sub-species of lions \u2013 the African and the Asiatic lions. This AnimalSake article has enlisted 8 different species of lions with pictures.\nDid You Know?\nThe roar of an adult male lion can be heard up to five miles away.\nThe genus Panthera includes lions, tigers, jaguars, leopards, and snow leopards. Basically, the members of this genus are the only felines that have the ability to roar. Rightly called \u2018the king of the jungle\u2019, a lion is certainly unparalleled when it comes to roaring. Unlike the robust roar of males that can be heard when the male defends his territory, females roar gently while calling their cubs. Primarily nocturnal in nature, lions hunt at night, and sleep during the day. They are the only cats that display sexual dimorphism, which means that the males differ from the females in terms of appearance. Also, they are the only cats that live in social groups called prides.\nWhile one of the male African lions leads a pride, which consists of 2-3 males, and 10-12 females. The females are related to each other, and never leave the pride. On the other hand, Asiatic lions are solitary. Their interaction with females is confined to mating. The African lion is the tallest animal among the members of Felidae family, and they are also second largest in the Felidae family.\nCurrently, wild lions exist only in the sub-Saharan Africa, and a very small number of Asiatic lions (a sub-species of African lions) is found in the Gir Forest Reserve in Gujarat, India. The population of Asiatic lions had declined to a mere 18 animals in 1893. But thanks to the conservation efforts, the population is now around 400. The African lions were classified as Vulnerable in 2004, but their numbers are declining, with their population estimated to be between 23,000 and 39,000. With the population down to less than 1,500, they are meeting the criteria for regionally Endangered in the West Africa.\nThough the modern lions have been classified into 24 sub-species on the basis of morphological differences (size, thickness of the coat, color of the coat, mane size, etc.) in different geographical regions, mitochondrial DNA sequence variation analysis suggests that sub-Saharan lions (Panthera leo) should be considered as a single sub-species.\nInformation About Lions\nClassification\nKingdom: Animalia\nPhylum: Chordata\nClass: Mammalia\nOrder: Carnivora\nFamily: Felidae\nGenus: Panthera\nSpecies: Panthera leo\nThough there is only one species, lions are classified into different subspecies.\nTypes of Lions\nAbout 10,000 years ago, lions were also found in Eurasia as well as America. With time, some species became extinct. Eight subspecies of lions are recognized. These include:\nP. l. persica (Asiatic lion)\nPopularly known as the Indian lion or the Persian lion, this species is widely found in the Gir Forest National Park in the state of Gujarat, India. It is slightly smaller than the African lion and has a less developed mane. The male species weighs between 160 to 190 kg, while the female weighs between 110 to 120 kg. Compared to the African lion, it has a lesser genetic variation.\nP. l. leo (Barbary lion)\nIt is believed to be native to the Atlas Mountain of North Africa, which is why it is also called the Atlas lion. Once, it was considered to be one of the biggest lion species. According to records and stuffed museum specimens, its length (head to tail) varied between 7 feet 9 inches to 9 feet 2 inches. It is typically considered extinct now, since records depict that some of the last lions of these species were killed somewhere between the 1950s and 1960s.\nP. l. senegalensis (West African lion)\nIt is also called the Senegal lion, and is native to West Africa, which is why it is called the West African lion. Its size is somewhat similar to the lions native to Central Africa, but is smaller than the ones from Southern Africa. The total population of this species is believed to be less than 1000 overall, and is considered to be among the most endangered species.\nP. l. azandica (Northeast Congo Lion)\nThis subspecies is native to the lands of Uganda and D R Congo; it is also called the \u2018Uganda lion\u2019. It is found in the Kidepo Valley in Uganda, and also in parts of Central Africa, in the Murchison Falls National Parks. It was abundantly found in the Congo River Basin, but, after the surveys conducted in 2008, no lions have been found there. This species is also classified as severely endangered.\nP. l. nubica (East African or Masai lion)\nThis East African species is described as being from \u2018Nubia\u2019, and has longer legs and less curvier backs than other species. They are generally between 8 to 10 feet tall, and have a variety of mane styles. That is to say, they have great tufts of manes, or their manes look like they have been combed backwards. Fortunately, this species hasn\u2019t been classified as endangered yet, and is found in parts of Uganda and Kenya and the Tanga Region.\nP. l. bleyenberghi (Southwest African or Katanga lion)\nThis species is native to southwestern Africa. It is found in Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, Zaire, Angola, etc. It is among the largest lion subspecies. The name \u2018Katanga\u2019 signifies a place called \u2018Katanga\u2019, in Zaire, from where the species seems to have originated. Katanga lions have lighter manes than their counterparts.\nP. l. krugeri (Southeast African or Transvaal lion)\nIt is native to southeast Africa, and is called \u2018Transvaal lion\u2019 after the \u2018Transvaal\u2019 region of South Africa. It has a well-developed, full mane, and is black-maned as well. The males weigh between 150 to 250 kg, while the females weigh between 110 to 180 kg. It is also found in the Kruger National Park and the Kalahari region.\nP. l. melanochaita (Cape lion)\nThis subspecies of the lion family is completely extinct. It was considered to be the heaviest of all lions\u2015apparently, it weighed close to 500 pounds and was around 10 feet in length. It had a thick black mane, sometimes, a black fringe, and black-colored ear tips. Research studies suggest that it preyed on wild zebras, donkeys, buffaloes, and even cattle. The man-eating ones were reported to be old and weak.\nSome Other Types\nWhite lion\nWhite lions belong to the same species as the P. l. krugeri (Southeast African or Transvaal lion). They are white-colored due to a color mutation, a recessive trait. They are extremely rare and are found only in zoos, sanctuaries, and wildlife reserves. They are said to be native to the Timbavati region of South Africa. Their color may range from blond to off-white to white. They are found in the Lory Park Zoo in South Africa, the Belgrade Zoo in Serbia, the Karachi Zoo in Pakistan, the Kingdom of Zion in New Zealand, etc.\nKalahari Lion\nAs the name suggests, these lions are native to the Kalahari region of Africa. They are black-maned and have adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Kalahari. They have a lower body weight as compared to their counterparts, and this helps them hunt faster, making their bodies swift and agile. They are known to hunt at night due to the cooler temperatures and availability of prey. Their bodies are naturally adaptable to higher endurance.\nIt is indeed unfortunate that these strong and handsome cats are becoming an endangered species, thanks to the extensive poaching and hunting activities undertaken by the human race. In a bid to protect these majestic creatures from further harm and extinction, many organizations are taking efforts to pass legislation and enforcing prohibition of lion hunting."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lions - Big Cat Facts, Information & Habitat - Animal Corner", "url": "https://animalcorner.org/animals/lion/", "text": "The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera and belongs to the family Felidae, along with tigers, leopards and jaguars. It is native to Africa and India and is the second largest cat in the world, following the tiger.\nWhile once found throughout much of Africa, Asia and Europe, lions are presently encountered in the wild only in Africa and in the Gir Forest of India (where it is found only in the Sasan-Gir National Park). A lions main habitats are open woodlands, savannas, scrub country and grassy plains.\nLions are known for their huge bodies and manes, and their social groups known as prides. One of the strongest felines in the world, they are apex predators and keystone predators, meaning they are extremely important in the food chain and have a large effect on the environment around them.\nThese big cats have become one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Unfortunately, because of this, they are now a vulnerable animal, with their population decreasing.\nAs the world\u2019s most social felines, there is lots to know about these amazing animals. Keep reading on to find out more and learn some cool lion facts.\nHistory\nThe word \u2018lion\u2019 is derived from Latin: leo and Ancient Greek: \u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd (leon). There are two types of lion subspecies. One is named Panthera leo melanochaita and lives across South and East Africa. The second lion subspecies has the scientific name Panther leo leo and lives in West Africa, Central Africa, and Asia. Up until 2017 there were two recognized subspecies, the African lions and Asiatic lions, but scientists reclassified lions that year.\nIt is thought the lion evolved in eastern and southern Africa about 124,000 years ago. They were found in many areas of the world, including Europe, North and Central America, as well as in Africa and the Middle East and India.\nLions disappeared from North America about 10,000 years ago, from the Balkans about 2,000 years ago, and from Palestine during the Crusades. Now they only live in Africa and in India.\nCharacteristics\nLions are very large animals that can weigh between 120 kg\u2014249 kg (264 lbs\u2014550 lbs) with a length between 1.4m\u20142.5m (4.7ft\u20148.2ft). Lions have sexual dimorphism, meaning that females (lionesses) typically have a different appearance and a smaller size than males, which is a special characteristic that is not present in other cat species. The biggest lion ever recorded and documented was around 375 kg (827 lbs) in weight.\nLions are tawny, brown, gold or blonde in color and have a short coat with a long tail that has a tuft of longer fur at the end. The functions of the tuft is unknown, and it is absent at birth and develops at around 5 1\u20442 months of age. The markings on their coat are much fainter than other big cats, which helps them to go unseen when they stalk their prey. Lions of young age have light spots on their coats that disappear as they grow.\nLions jaws are very strong and contain 30 teeth, including four fang-like canines and four carnassial teeth. Their bodies are muscular and slender, and they have flexible forelimbs and retractable claws. Their heels do not touch the ground when they walk, which is because they have big toes and pads on the bottom of their feet, which allow them to move quietly.\nThey have a deep chest with a short, rounded head, and a reduced neck. Their ears are disk shaped and their have excellent vision. In fact, the eyes of the lion are six times more sensitive to light than the eyes of a human. This means their night vision is far better than that of some of their prey.\nMale lions have manes and this is thought to be connected with testosterone levels. They can range in color from blonde, to red, brown and black and covers the head, neck and chest of the male. The color and length of a lion\u2019s mane not only reveal his age but also his behavior. Manes get darker as the lion ages so the darker mane of a lion in a pride denotes the oldest of the group.\nManes that are darker and longer often belong to lions that attract more females, and male lions are more likely to attack other lions blonder, and shorter manes, as this may show they are not as strong or able to fight as well.\nThere are big cats out there with color mutations, such as the white tiger or black panther. Likewise, there is an uncommon color mutation of lions that leaves their coat extremely pale, and these are known as the white lion.\nTheir white coat is caused by recessive traits. Because they are so unique, they had to be captured and moved into captivity in the second half of the 20th century to protect them. However, they\u2019re now being reintroduced back into environments in South Africa and are successfully breeding and hunting in their native environments.\nLifespan\nLions usually live for 10 to 14 years in the wild, and for 20 to 25 years in captivity.\nDiet\nLions are generalist carnivores, meaning they are able to thrive in a wide variety of environmental conditions and can make use of a variety of different resources. They are also called hyper-carnivores because meat makes more than 70% part of their diet. An adult male lion requires an average amount of 7 kg of meat per day to survive, although they could eat up to 43 kg! Females could eat up to 25 kg a day.\nTheir prey usually consists of mammals weighing between 190\u2013550 kg (420\u20131,210 lbs) such as zebras, wildebeest and antelopes. They\u2019ll also eat giraffe, buffalo, gazelle and warthog, and young elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus. In times of shortage, they also catch and eat a variety of smaller animals, like rodents and reptiles. Lions also steal kills from hyenas, leopards and other predators.\nLions are both apex predators and keystone predators. As an apex predator, lions reside at the top of the food chain and no other creatures prey on them. As a keystone predator, they are very important in regulating the population of other animals in their environment. Without them in the ecosystem, the populations of the species that they prey upon would explode uncontrollably, which can cause detrimental impacts to the ecological community.\nThe majority of the hunting in a pride of lions is done by the females. They work together as a group to trap and capture prey they would otherwise not be able to get while hunting on their own. When lions hunt, they rely heavily on their teeth to grab prey, suffocating the animal or collapsing its trachea. Because of this constant use, about 40 percent of African lions have dental injuries.\nLions do not have great stamina, and they only run fast in short bursts. This means that they need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. Generally, they have a relatively low hunting success rate.\nThat being said, they are determined animals. While they don\u2019t enjoy water, they are great swimmers and will chase their prey into and across water if they have to.\nOnce the prey has been caught, the females will allow the male lion to eat first before eating themselves. The cubs are at the bottom of the pile and have to be content with what remains once the adults have finished.\nContrary to popular belief, lions do not hunt humans! Lions can actually form bonds with humans under certain circumstances.\nBehavior\nGenerally, big cats are solitary animals. However, lions are the exception to this. Lions live in groups known as \u201cprides\u201d, which can contain as many as 40 lions. However, some lions of both sexes become nomads and prefer to live alone.\nWhile not quite as rapid as the cheetah which can reach speeds of 70 mph, a lion can achieve a land speed of 50 mph for short distances. They have an amazing jump, and have been recorded springing as far as 36 feet. They can also climb extremely well, and are capable of climbing vertical tree trunks with ease.\nDespite being very strong and often active, lions spend much of the day sleeping! In fact, the average amount of time they spend moving is two hours a day, and they can sleep for up to 20 hours a day! This is because they do not have many sweat glands so in order to conserve energy, they will lie about and rest. They are more active at night when it is cooler, although they do most of their hunting during the day.\nPrides\nOn average, a lion pride contains around 10 to 15 lions, mainly compromised of related females; adults, sub-adults (between the ages of 2 and 4) and cubs, plus one or more resident males. The maximum number of adult male lions in a pride is 4.\nFemale cubs will stay with the pride as they grow older. When they reach sexual maturity, at about 2 years old, they will be hunters for the pride. Young male lions get kicked out of the pride by older males at the same age. These young males then live and roam in small groups (often with brothers and cousins), until they find another pride that they could take over and breed with females. This will often lead to fights with existing males in the pride.\nWhen a male lion takes over a pride, it can kill all the lion cubs to bring the pride\u2019s females into heat again, allowing them to breed and raise their own cubs. However, male lions become a member of the pride because the females accept them as the pride male. They will usually only be able to remain the pride male 3 to 5 years in the wild, as lionesses can turn on and kill older previously dominant males in a pride.\nThe job of a male in a pride is not only reproduction, but also protection. They guard their territory and keep out other pride and predators that might affect the food supply of their pride. Male lions patrol a territory of around 100m\u00b2, marking trees and rocks with urine and roaring to warn off intruders.\nThe abundance of prey availability plays a significant role in the size of a lion pride. While females usually stay in their mother\u2019s pride for life, food scarcity can force them out.\nAsiatic lion prides differ from the African lion prides, and Asiatic lions actually divide themselves into two prides. Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to only three other males to form a loose pride. Females associate with up to 12 females to form a stronger pride together with their cubs. Female and male Asiatic lions usually associate only for a few days during the mating season, and very rarely travel or feed together.\nReproduction and Cubs\nBoth male and female lions become sexually mature between the ages of two and three, and by the age of four, most females have reproduced. They usually give birth to 2 to 3 cubs at a time and can give birth to a litter every two years. The the gestation period is quite short, around four months or 110 days.\nLionesses are polyestrous, meaning they can go into heat several times per year. The females in a group of lions typically give birth at about the same time. This allows for the young lions to play and grow up together with support from the entire pride.\nWhen a cub is born, the process is kept secret. The pregnant lioness will give birth to a cub away from the rest of the pride and will proceed to hide the young from everyone else for the following six weeks. It is thought they do this to protect the cubs from intruding male lions and other predators.\nAs a newborn, a lion cub only weighs between 2.6 and 4.6 pounds (1.2 to 2.1 kg). Lion cubs are born blind and their eyes open around seven days after birth. They are yellowish-red in color and can look like a domestic cat. They\u2019re also usually covered in darker spots that help to camouflage them in their den to protect them whilst the adults have gone out to hunt.\nAs lions are mammals, the females nurse their cubs for about 6 to 7 months. The cubs are totally dependent on their mothers for the initial 3 months of their lives, and after 3 months they start eating meat. A mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old, and, while they are in this period, she will move her cubs to a new den site several times a month to avoid predators, carrying each lion cub, one by one, by the nape of their neck.\nYoung cubs begin to participate in pride kills at 11 months. Unfortunately, less than half of cubs make it to be a year old and four out of five have died by the time they are two, generally either from animal attacks or starvation.\nThat being said, lionesses are not only caring towards their own young, but if a cub is neglected in any way, a lioness will allow it to suckle in an effort to help the cub survive.\nLion\u2019s Roar\nLions can roar very loudly! Their roar can measure up to about 114 decibels in volume, which is louder than any other big cat and can even breach the pain threshold of human hearing. It can be heard as far as 5 miles away (8 km).\nLions usually roar this loudly when they are trying to defend their territories or ward off other males. A roar also allows members of a pride to find one another as its sound can travel such long distances.\nLocation and Habitat \u2013 Where Do Lions Live?\nLions are exclusively found in Africa, scattered across Sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is one species of lion \u2014 the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo leo) \u2014 that only lives in Gujarat, India. There are around 650 wild individuals of this species.\nDespite dubbed the \u201cking of the jungle\u201d, the lion very rarely enters a closed forest, and they are totally absent from the rainforest. They prefer grassy plains and savannahs, open woodlands with bushes and scrub bordering rivers. The home area of a lion pride range from 13 to 100 square miles.\nLions can live high up, too. On Mount Elgon, an extinct shield volcano on the border of Uganda and Kenya, lions have been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to the snow line on Mount Kenya.\nHistorically, lions spanned most of the central rainforest zone and the Sahara desert. They also lived in southern Europe and Asia.\nConservation Status\nLions are listed as \u201cVulnerable\u201d on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is a step above being declared \u201cEndangered\u201d. The lion population is at risk and under threat from habitat loss and hunting.\nBetween 1993 and 2014, the population of lions decreased by 42%. The IUCN\u2019s last assessment places the adult population between 23,000 to 39,000 individuals. The population is even more in jeopardy, because the remaining populations are often geographically isolated from each other, which causes inbreeding.\nThreats\nLions do not have any natural predators as they are apex predators and up at the top of the food chain.\nThe biggest threat to lions are humans, particularly hunters. Poachers hunt lions for their bones, which are used in traditional medicines as well as in expensive wines. They are also hunted by trophy hunters and big game hunters. Loss of habitat and lack of food is another common threat to lions.\nExtinct Lions\nIt is thought that around 10,000 years ago lions were the most widespread mammal outside of humans. Unfortunately, there are species of lion that are now extinct. Let\u2019s take a look at these lions below.\nCape Lion\nThe Cape lion was last seen in South Africa, where it lived, in 1858. It had a much darker main than other species of lion. The Cape lion is now recognized as a subpopulation rather than a different species or subspecies.\nBarbary Lion\nThe Barbary lion was thought to go extinct in the 19th century, with the last documented sighting being in Algeria\u2019s Atlas Mountains in 1942. It used to live across the North Coast of Africa and even stretched as far as Egypt and Morocco.\nCave Lion (Panthera leo spelaea)\nThe Cave lion disappeared around 12,000 years ago. It was found across Eurasia and into Alaska and went extinct with the collapse of the mammoth steppe. It was larger than today\u2019s surviving lions.\nAmerican Lion (Panthera leo atrox)\nThe American lion also disappeared around 12,000 years ago. It was found across most of the modern day United States and Mexico and was the largest lion species to date.\nLion FAQs\nWhen are lions most active?\nLions are primarily nocturnal (active at night) or crepuscular (becoming active at twilight or before sunset). Lions spend much of their time resting, often up to 20 hours per day. Lions rest for lots of different reasons, including energy conservation, lack of prey and to avoid the heat of the day.\nWhat is a lions habitat?\nLions are mostly found in Africa, with one species, the Asiatic lion, found in India. In these locations they inhabit a wide range of habitats from grassy plains and savannahs to open woodlands with bushes. Despite the lyrics of a popular song, the one place you are almost certain never to see a lion sleeping is in the Jungle.\nWhy do lions have tails?\nA Lion\u2019s tail comes in handy in a variety of ways, and it is no surprise that they have evolved to maintain their tales because of how much they use them. Physically, a Lion\u2019s tail helps it to balance. But it will also use the tail to signal both in parental situations and hunting.\nWhere do lions sleep?\nGenerally a Lion will sleep wherever it can keep cool. They don\u2019t have many sweat glands and need to conserve energy. Hot environments can make that difficult, so you are likely to find Lions sleeping in thickets and brush, under trees or area with a good through breeze.\nLion Fun Fact!"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "16 Interesting Facts About White Lions We Never Knew", "url": "https://yocover.com/facts-about-white-lions/", "text": "Have you ever heard about the existence of the white lion? If not, then you are in for a big surprise. White lions do exist. White Lions are the lions that have a true white color. There are many facts about White lions we will discover.\nThe white lions are not albinos, as the white coloration is due to some color mutations, a rare gene mutation. Similar to the white peacocks as they are the result of sex-linked mutation.\nWhite Lion\nThe white lion is not subspecies of lion. White lion belongs to this particular subspecies of lion, Panthera leo Kruger, known as the Southeast African Lion. So these animals are also referred to as African white lions.\nPanthera leo is the scientific name for a white lion. White lions are just as much of an apex predator as wild tawny lions in their natural habitat.\nThe white lion results from a genetic rarity, a recessive gene responsible for white coloration in furs. White lions are believed to be natives of the Timbavati region of South Africa.\nWhite lions were first reported in 1938. However, they first came to public attention in the 1970s. White lions are not pure white, so they are also referred to as blond lions.\nWhite lions have also been hunted to extinction in the wild, but they have been reintroduced to their natural habitat by Global White Lion Protection Trust (GWLPT). The main reason why most of the white lions are settled in zoos/captivity.\nWhite Lions Facts\nSome tribes in Southern Africa revered White Lion as sacred beings because of their majestic coloration. They can hunt and have other features, same as purebred. However, the brink of extinction is roaming around these African species.\nLet us find out some interesting facts about White Lions.\n1. Appearance\nNormally lions have hazel or golden-brown fur, but the white lions have entirely white or an extremely pale version of the usual fur. The color of fur in White lions ranges from blonde to near-white\nWhite lions have blue or golden color eyes, black noses, and dark-spotted color patches at the rear of the ear.\nThe White male lions have yellowish blonde or white color mane and the same color at the tip of their tail. The female does not have a mane.\n2. Size\nMale white lion weights up to 530 pounds and female up to 400 pounds. Their average lifespan is about 18 years. The male white lion is up to 10 feet long and 4 feet high and 6 feet long, and 3.6 feet for females.\n3. Habitat of White lions\nWhite lions are native to southern Africa. They are indigenous to the Timbavati region in southern Africa. Savannas, woodlands, and desert areas are the natural habitat of a white lion.\nDue to excessive hunting, they went extinct once but are currently protected at the Central Kruger Park in South Africa. The Global White Lion Protection Trust (GWLT) initiated a world-first re-establishment of white lions within their natural habitat in 2004.\nThe first white lion cub was born in 2006 using a selective reintroduction technique. The white lion has been successfully introduced into certain areas of the wild.\n4. Diet\nWhite lions are carnivorous. They prey on zebra, buffalo, gazelles, tortoises, reptiles, small birds, and hoofed mammals. The presence of sharp teeth and claws makes them great hunters.\n5. Skilled hunters\nLions typically kill their prey by strangulation, and the pack consumes the carcass at the site of the kill. The pack patiently stalk the prey and attack at the right moment. The study suggests that white lions are equally apex predators as tawny lions.\n6. White lions are not albinos\nAlbinism is a disorder characterized by an absence of pigmentation in the skin, eyes, and hair. The white lion varies in color from blonde to near-white and even red.\nA white lion possesses a genetic condition known as leucistic. Because of the leucism, pigmentation is lost in fur but is present in the eyes.\nWhite lions have normal-colored eyes, lips, and paw pads, unlike albinos. Some of them also have blue eyes. The white color is the result of the recessive gene.\nThis proves that white lions are not albinos. Some scientists also claim that this condition is in the lions living in the Timbavati area.\n7. Reproduction\nA white lion reaches sexual maturity between ages three and four. As of now, most of the white lions are in captivity, so they are bred there.\nA lioness usually gives birth to 2-4 cubs. They mate once every two years in the wild, but they are made to mate once a year in captivity. Lion\u2019s cubs are born blind and dependent on the mother for the first two years.\nA cub is born white only if both of its parents carry the recessive \u2018white\u2019 gene. So these lions may have a coat color that ranges from pale blond to almost pure white.\n8. Whitecoat does not offer camouflage\nIt is also said that white lions are not fit for wildlife due to their white coat, which does not provide camouflage in the wild. Poachers and hunters easily spot them in the wild.\nHowever, this does not turn out to be true as it lacks any scientific basis. Nevertheless, the white coat color could be a disadvantage, as far as hunting is concerned.\n9. Family-oriented\nUnlike, Siberian Tigers White male lions live with their family consisting of few lionesses and cubs. As they are extinct in the wild, the Kruger National Park has artificially created the environment for these lions.\nThey have an instinct to protect their family and cubs from danger. Furthermore, inform them to hunt in a pack if they see prey around. Being the \u201cKing\u201d of the jungle, caring nature is one of the amazing facts about White lions.\nAs they are kept in their original habitat in the Timbavati region, successful breeding is crucial in saving these critically endangered species.\n10. Communication\nWhite lions communicate with the vocalization pattern. They a groundbreaking roar to warn potential threats or keep away predators from their family.\nWhite lions are soft and caring, and they use chuffing sounds while interacting with the member of the pack or with their offspring. The way they communicate and alert their pack is also one of the amazing facts about White lions.\n11. Speed\nAs they belong to the same family of South African lions, the speed of these lions would be similar. The speed of South African lions is up to 50 mph, so does the White lions.\nThe exact data was impossible to retrieve as they were kept in captivity for conservation reasons; they were extinct in the late 1990s.\n12. Cultural Importance\nWhite lions have significant cultural importance to the local Sepedi and Tsonga of the Greater Timbavati/Kruger park region. White lions are considered sacred in these communities.\nWhite lions are symbols of leadership, pride, and royalty and are viewed as national assets in countries like Kenya and Botswana. These facts about White lions show their cultural value and importance.\n13. White lions are leucistic\nLeucistic is a genetic condition that causes white lions to have less melanin or other pigments than other non-leucistic animals. Melanin is a group of dark pigments found in skin, hair, fur, and eyes.\nA very rare gene known as the recessive gene is responsible for leucism that causes the lion to lack dark pigmentation in some areas but retains pigmentation in the eyes, paws, and nose. Leucistic animals are different from albinos.\n14. Health issues\nWhite lions result from two parents having the recessive gene, and this cannot be considered the healthy bred than the pure ones. There will be some problems related to health that can be identified late, or in some cases, can be seen at birth.\nTo conserve these species, the inbreeding process is still in progress. Most researchers explain that it is good for preserving this majestic and beautiful creature.\nAt the same time, they want to be aware of some consequences. White lions are already carrying the recessive gene from their parents, and the inbreeding with another White lion will give two copies of the rare deleterious mutations.\n15. Population of the White lion\nA white lion is not separate subspecies; rather, it belongs to one of the subspecies known as the African White Lion. The coat color of a white lion is due to some rare mutation.\nBecause of this reason, the number of white lions is very less. Most of them are kept in captivity or zoo, and few are in the Timbavati region, their ancestral homeland.\nThere are around 100 white lions kept in captivity and 13 in the wild. The reason behind keeping them in captivity is to promote inbreeding, and they are not quite safe in the wild.\nGlobal White Lion Protection Trust is an organization that is responsible for reintroducing these lions to their native habitat and is protecting white lions from extinction.\n16. It is an Endangered Species\nSince their discovery in 1938, white lions have been hunted and forcefully removed from their natural habitat. Few adult white lions remain in the natural wild habitat as their existence is highly at stake.\nGlobal White Lion Protection Trust (GWLT) initiated a world-first re-establishment of white lions within their natural habitat in 2004. Since then, many white lion cubs have been born in the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve and the Nwanetsi Area of Kruger National Park.\nThis proves that the recessive gene is still present in the wild population and the white lion is a natural occurrence. The biggest threat to white lions is the uncontrolled trading and hunting of lions.\nWhite lions rose back from the brink of extinction. They are not albinos and are as dangerous and furious as other lions. These facts about White lions explain their status in the wild, and the measures of protection taken by the authorities are commendable.\n(Last Updated On: June 1, 2022)"}

There are two recognised subspecies, the African lion P. l. leo and the Asiatic lion P. l. persica.\nSome taxonomists have proposed a different split of the subspecies - with P. l. leo covering lions in Asian and west, central and north Africa, and P. l. melanochaita for lions in south and east Africa.\nWhy do lions have manes?\nMale lions boast impressive manes, conveying a range of information about their owners status among the pack. Long dark manes indicate that the lion is in peak condition. The darker the mane, the more attractive to females. However, long dark manes can also lead to lower sperm counts in males when temperatures rise.\nMale lion in the Masai Mara, Kenya. \u00a9 WL Davies/Getty\nWhy do lions roar?\nLions have very complex communication behaviours, producing a variety of calls, but are known for being the king of the roar. A lions roar can be heard from 8km away, being brought on by a number of reasons. From territorial displays to locating other members of the pride, allowing females to differentiate between outsiders and males of the pack, helping them protect their cubs from lions that could potentially attack their young in aims to overthrow the pack.\nScarface: the legacy of a lion As the sun sets on the reign of the most famous lion ever to walk the Maasai Mara, we look back at the life of a legend \u2013 and the winds of change blowing through this iconic grassland.

The Kuno Palpur Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh has been \u2018prepared\u2019 and is awaiting translocation of a number of Asiatic lions, which survive only in the greater Gir landscape in Gujarat, western India. In the meantime, tigers are moving into Kuno from the famous Ranthambhore Reserve, crossing rivers and ravines along the way.\nThis Q&A originally appeared in BBC Wildlife Magazine, and was answered by Prenrna Bindra.\nWhat do lions eat?\nLions will kill anything, from mice and lizards to wildebeest and other large animals to feed the pack. If an opportunity arises, lions will steal kills from wild dogs or hyenas.\nMost hunting takes place at dusk until dawn with the cooler temperatures being essential for the long hours spent in search of food. On days where food is highly accessible, an average male lion can consume 15 percent of their body weight.\nPlease note that external videos may contain ads:\nWhat is a baby lion called?\nYoung lions are called cubs. When they are born with blue eyes, changing to an amber hue at the age of three months. At eleven months cubs will start to hunt, and will remain with their mother for around two years. Females often stay on to become members of the pride, whereas male cubs will go off attempting to establish their own. Females tend to have two to three cubs per litter.\nTwo young lion cubs. \u00a9 Jochen Van de Perre/Getty\nHow many lions live in a pride?\nLions are the most sociable members of the cat family living in prides with up to 25 others. This is down to the availability of prey in the area. The females are all related, often making up the majority of the pride, consisting of only 1-4 males.\nShowing item 1 of 8 previous item next item Page 1\nPage 2\nPage 3\nPage 4\nPage 5\nPage 6\nPage 7\nPage 8\nDo lions often climb trees?\nLioness sleeping in tree, Panthera leo. Ndutu Conservation Area, Tanzania\nNot really, says Sarah Huebner from the Lion Research Centre. Though individuals from most prides exhibit tree-climbing behaviour, they don't do it very often - in less than five per cent of observations.\nThe primary motivation for heading up into the branches it to avoid something unpleasant on the ground, such as an attack by elephants or buffalo. These skirmishes often occur after a failed predation event, when the prey animals have sufficent numcers to retaliate. Elephants and buffalo are quite capable of killing a cornered lion due to their size and strength.\nLions may also climb trees to get better vantage points for identifying potential targets, or to avoid biting insects.\nWhy is the African lion endangered?\nOverall, lions are listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, although the different subpopulations have different classifications. The Asiatic subspecies is listed as Endangered.\nLions face a number of threats, including habitat loss, a decline in their prey species, trade in bones and other body parts for traditional medicine, and killing in retribution and defence of human life and livestock.\nHow can lions survive? Words: James Fairfield Words: James Fairfield What do you think will save lions from going the way of sabre-toothed cats? More severe penalties for persecution? Greater restrictions on where people can live? Or a model that offers those Africans who live with lions some recompense for doing so? Lions are in trouble. Populations are declining across Africa, mainly because of increasing conflict with herders of cattle and other livestock. In short, people kill lions to stop them from taking their cows, sheep and goats. Lions in some countries are fairing better than others. In South Africa, for example, the population increased by 7 per cent over two decades, largely thanks to the use of fencing that separates the predators from the people. In Zimbabwe, numbers have grown by more than 1,000 per cent (but from a very, very low base of about 50), mainly on the back of trophy hunting. But in all of West Africa and even popular wildlife tourism destinations such as Botswana, Tanzania and Zambia, they're disappearing at a rate of knots. Now new research has found that lions are doing better in the Masai Mara ecosystem, in Kenya (where in fact the overall country trend is down) thanks to the creation of community conservancies. Households with conservancy membership receive a share of the money that comes from wildlife tourism. Where there are lions and other carnivores, you get more tourists and local people are financially better off. The paper, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, shows that the average lion population density within the Mara\u2019s conservancies \u2013 almost 12 lions per 100km2 \u2013 between 2008 and 2013 was 2.6 times higher than previously reported in 2003. Not only that, but those livestock settlements that were not members of a conservancy and were within the home range of a lion pride had a large negative effect on lioness survival rates. \u201cThis suggests that lions can survive outside of fenced areas within pastoral regions if communities gain benefits from wildlife,\u201d say the authors, led by Sara Blackburn and Dr Grant Hopcraft of the University of Glasgow. Dr Laurence Frank, director of the Living With Lions project, added: \u201cOnly local people can reverse the downward spiral [in wildlife numbers], and this study shows that profits from tourism can motivate rural people to tolerate rather than eliminate wild animals.\u201d Find out about Living With Lions\nHow to survive a lion attack\nWords: John Coppinger\nMost lions flee, even from people on foot, but an attack is a possibility and knowing how to react could save your life. Walking safaris are a relatively new concept, and lions still perceive humans on foot as a threat.\nConversely, as the biggest tourist attraction in many African wildlife reserves, lions have become fairly habituated to vehicles and can be approached to within a few feet. Indeed, they often appear totally oblivious to them, despite the excited chattering of their occupants and the clicking of cameras.\nLion in front of a safari jeep. \u00a9 Marlon du Toit/Getty\nLion behaviour varies from region to region. When I first went to Zambia\u2019s North Luangwa National Park, it was virtually devoid of tourists, so the lions weren\u2019t habituated.\nMany of our early encounters with lions there (while we were building a camp) developed into mock charges, which was disconcerting to say the least.\nWhat to do if you are attacked by a lion\nBeing charged by a lion when you are on foot is extremely frightening. It is difficult to stop yourself from bolting, but that is likely to prompt an attack. A lion charge is usually accompanied by a deep growling sound that reverberates through your very core.\nBeing charged by a lion is just about the scariest thing you'll ever see. \u00a9 Jami Tarris/Getty\nIt is vital to stand your ground, perhaps retreating very slowly, but to continue facing the lion while clapping your hands, shouting and waving your arms around to make yourself look bigger. Most charges are mock charges, so you will usually be fine.\nAnd remember: hold your ground! Never run or turn your back.\nHow to avoid been attacked by a lion\nDo not approach too closely, especially in the case of mating lions or lionesses with cubs. Different circumstances trigger different behaviour. During courtship, male lions are often extremely aggressive and should not be approached, even in a vehicle.\nA lioness with cubs is naturally protective and should be given lots of space. And being predominantly nocturnal, lions lose their inherent fear of humans at night and become much more dangerous and prone to attack.\nAdvertisement\nBe more cautious at night. Avoid camping in areas of high lion density \u2013 maintain a watch throughout the night if worried."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Asiatic lion - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_lion", "text": "Lion population in India\nThe Asiatic lion is a Panthera leo leo population surviving today only in India. Since the turn of the 20th century, its range has been restricted to Gir National Park and the surrounding areas in the Indian state of Gujarat. Historically, it inhabited much of the Middle East to northern India.\nThe first scientific description of the Asiatic lion was published in 1826 by the Austrian zoologist Johann N. Meyer, who named it Felis leo persicus. On the IUCN Red List, it is listed under its former scientific name Panthera leo persica as Endangered because of its small population size and area of occupancy. Until the 19th century, it occurred in Saudi Arabia, eastern Turkey, Iran, Mesopotamia, Pakistan, and from east of the Indus River to Bengal and the Narmada River in Central India.\nThe population has steadily increased since 2010. In May 2015, the 14th Asiatic Lion Census was conducted over an area of about 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi); the lion population was estimated at 523 individuals, comprising 109 adult males, 201 adult females and 213 cubs. In August 2017, surveyors counted 650 wild lions. In June 2020, an estimation exercise counted 674 Asiatic lions in the Gir forest region, an increase of 29% over the 2015 census figure.\nThe lion is one of five pantherine cats native to India, along with the Bengal tiger (P. tigris tigris), Indian leopard (P. pardus fusca), snow leopard (P. uncia) and clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa). It was also known as the Indian lion and the Persian lion.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nFelis leo persicus was the scientific name proposed by Johann N. Meyer in 1826 who described an Asiatic lion skin from Persia. In the 19th century, several zoologists described lion zoological specimen from other parts of Asia that used to be considered synonyms of P. l. persica:\nIn 2017, the Asiatic lion was subsumed to P. l. leo due to close morphological and molecular genetic similarities with Barbary lion specimens. However, several scientists continue using P. l. persica for the Asiatic lion.\nEvolution [ edit ]\nFossil remains of Panthera spelaea excavated in the Cromer Stage indicate that it represented a genetically isolated and highly distinct lineage, not closely related to Asiatic lions. Fossil lion remains were found in Pleistocene deposits in West Bengal. A fossil carnassial excavated in the Batadomba Cave indicates that the Sri Lanka lion (P. l. sinhaleyus) inhabited Sri Lanka during the late Pleistocene, and is thought to have become extinct around 39,000 years ago. Deraniyagala described this lion in 1939.\nPhylogeography [ edit ]\nResults of a phylogeographic analysis based on mtDNA sequences of lions from across the global range, including now extinct populations like Barbary lions, indicates that Sub-Saharan African lions are phylogenetically basal to all modern lions. These findings support an African origin of modern lion evolution with a probable centre in East and Southern Africa. It is likely that lions migrated from there to West Africa, eastern North Africa and via the periphery of the Arabian Peninsula into Turkey, southern Europe and northern India during the last 20,000 years. The Sahara, Congolian rainforests and the Great Rift Valley are natural barriers to lion dispersal.\nGenetic markers of 357 samples from captive and wild lions from Africa and India were examined. Results indicate four lineages of lion populations: one in Central and North Africa to Asia, one in Kenya, one in Southern Africa, and one in Southern and East Africa; the first wave of lion expansion probably occurred about 118,000 years ago from East Africa into West Asia, and the second wave in the late Pleistocene or early Holocene periods from Southern Africa towards East Africa. The Asiatic lion is genetically closer to North and West African lions than to the group comprising East and Southern African lions. The two groups probably diverged about 186,000\u2013128,000 years ago. It is thought that the Asiatic lion remained connected to North and Central African lions until gene flow was interrupted due to extinction of lions in Western Eurasia and the Middle East during the Holocene.\nAsiatic lions are less genetically diverse than African lions, which may be the result of a founder effect in the recent history of the remnant population in the Gir Forest.\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\nAsiatic lion cub An Asiatic lioness\nThe Asiatic lion's fur ranges in colour from ruddy-tawny, heavily speckled with black, to sandy or buffish grey, sometimes with a silvery sheen in certain lighting. Males have only moderate mane growth at the top of the head, so that their ears are always visible. The mane is scanty on the cheeks and throat, where it is only 10 cm (4 in) long. About half of Asiatic lions' skulls from the Gir forest have divided infraorbital foramina, whereas African lions have only one foramen on either side. The sagittal crest is more strongly developed, and the post-orbital area is shorter than in African lions. Skull length in adult males ranges from 330\u2013340 mm (13\u201313+1\u20442 in), and in females, from 292\u2013302 mm (11+1\u20442\u201311+7\u20448 in). It differs from the African lion by a larger tail tuft and less inflated auditory bullae. The most striking morphological character of the Asiatic lion is a longitudinal fold of skin running along its belly.\nMales have a shoulder height of up to 107\u2013120 cm (42\u201347 in), and females of 80\u2013107 cm (31+1\u20442\u201342 in). Two lions in Gir Forest measured 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) from head to body with a 0.79\u20130.89 m (31\u201335 in) long tail of and total lengths of 2.82\u20132.87 m (9 ft 3 in \u2013 9 ft 5 in). The Gir lion is similar in size to the Central African lion, and smaller than large African lions. An Adult male Asiatic lion weighs 160.1 kg (353 lb) on average with the limit being 190 kg (420 lb); a wild female weighs 100 to 130 kg (220 to 285 lb).\nManes [ edit ]\nAsiatic (above) and southern African (below) lions. Note the larger tail tuft, sparser mane on the head and prominent fold of skin on the abdomen of the former.\nColour and development of manes in male lions varies between regions, among populations and with age of lions. In general, the Asiatic lion differs from the African lion by a less developed mane. The manes of most lions in ancient Greece and Asia Minor were also less developed and did not extend to below the belly, sides or ulnas. Lions with such smaller manes were also known in the Syrian region, Arabian peninsula and Egypt.\nExceptionally sized lions [ edit ]\nThe confirmed record total length of a male Asiatic lion is 2.92 m (9 ft 7 in), including the tail. Emperor Jahangir allegedly speared a lion in the 1620s that measured 3.10 m (10 ft 2 in) and weighed 306 kg (675 lb). In 1841, English traveller Austen Henry Layard accompanied hunters in Khuzestan, Iran, and sighted a lion which \"had done much damage in the plain of Ram Hormuz,\" before one of his companions killed it. He described it as being \"unusually large and of very dark brown colour\", with some parts of its body being almost black. In 1935, a British admiral claimed to have sighted a maneless lion near Quetta in Pakistan. He wrote \"It was a large lion, very stocky, light tawny in colour, and I may say that no one of us three had the slightest doubt of what we had seen until, on our arrival at Quetta, many officers expressed doubts as to its identity, or to the possibility of there being a lion in the district.\"\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\nHabitat in Gir Forest\nIn Saurashtra's Gir Forest, an area of 1,412.1 km2 (545.2 sq mi) was declared as a sanctuary for Asiatic lion conservation in 1965. This sanctuary and the surrounding areas are the only habitats supporting the Asiatic lion. After 1965, a national park was established covering an area of 258.71 km2 (99.89 sq mi) where human activity is not allowed. In the surrounding sanctuary only Maldharis have the right to take their livestock for grazing.\nLions inhabit remnant forest habitats in the two hill systems of Gir and Girnar that comprise Gujarat's largest tracts of tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, thorny forest and savanna, and provide valuable habitat for a diverse flora and fauna. Five protected areas currently exist to protect the Asiatic lion: Gir Sanctuary, Gir National Park, Pania Sanctuary, Mitiyala Sanctuary, and Girnar Sanctuary. The first three protected areas form the Gir Conservation Area, a 1,452 km2 (561 sq mi) large forest block that represents the core habitat of the lion population. The other two sanctuaries Mitiyala and Girnar protect satellite areas within dispersal distance of the Gir Conservation Area. An additional sanctuary is being established in the nearby Barda Wildlife Sanctuary to serve as an alternative home for lions. The drier eastern part is vegetated with acacia thorn savanna and receives about 650 mm (26 in) annual rainfall; rainfall in the west is higher at about 1,000 mm (39 in) per year.\nThe lion population recovered from the brink of extinction to 411 individuals by 2010. In that year, approximately 105 lions lived outside the Gir forest, representing a quarter of the entire lion population. Dispersing sub-adults established new territories outside their natal prides, and as a result the satellite lion population has been increasing since 1995. By 2015, the total population had grown to an estimated 523 individuals, inhabiting an area of 7,000 km2 (2,700 sq mi) in the Saurashtra region. The Asiatic Lion Census conducted in 2017 revealed about 650 individuals.\nBy 2020, at least six satellite populations had spread to eight districts in Gujarat and live in human-dominated areas outside the protected area network.\nFormer range [ edit ]\nThe Asiatic lion used to occur in Arabia, Palestine, Mesopotamia and Baluchistan. In South Caucasia (present day Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan), it was known since the Holocene, and became extinct in the 10th century. Until the middle of the 19th century, it survived in regions adjoining Mesopotamia and Syria, and was still sighted in the upper reaches of the Euphrates River in the early 1870s. By the late 19th century, the Asiatic lion had become extinct in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The last known lion in Iraq was killed on the lower Tigris in 1918.\nHistorical records in Iran indicate that it ranged from the Khuzestan Plain to Fars Province at elevations below 2,000 m (6,600 ft) in steppe vegetation and pistachio-almond woodlands. It was widespread in the country, but in the 1870s, it was sighted only on the western slopes of the Zagros Mountains, and in the forest regions south of Shiraz. It served as the national emblem and appeared on the country's flag. Some of the country's last lions were sighted in 1941 between Shiraz and Jahrom in Fars Province, and in 1942, a lion was spotted about 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Dezful. In 1944, the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the Karun River in Iran's Khuzestan Province.\nIn India, the Asiatic lion occurred in Sind, Bahawalpur, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Bihar and eastward as far as Palamau and Rewa, Madhya Pradesh in the early 19th century. It once ranged to Bangladesh in the east and up to Narmada River in the south. Because of the lion's restricted distribution in India, Reginald Innes Pocock assumed that it arrived from Europe, southwestern Asia through Balochistan only recently, before humans started limiting its dispersal in the country. The advent and increasing availability of firearms led to its local extirpation over large areas. Heavy hunting by British colonial officers and Indian rulers caused a steady and marked decline of lion numbers in the country. Lions were exterminated in Palamau by 1814, in Baroda, Hariana and Ahmedabad district in the 1830s, in Kot Diji and Damoh in the 1840s. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a British officer shot 300 lions. The last lions of Gwalior and Rewah were shot in the 1860s. One lion was killed near Allahabad in 1866. The last lion of Mount Abu in Rajasthan was spotted in 1872. By the late 1870s, lions were extinct in Rajasthan. By 1880, no lion survived in Guna, Deesa and Palanpur districts, and only about a dozen lions were left in Junagadh district. By the turn of the century, the Gir Forest held the only Asiatic lion population in India, which was protected by the Nawab of Junagarh in his private hunting grounds.\nEcology and behaviour [ edit ]\nA male lion scent marking his territory in Gir Forest Female and male lion Young male\nMale Asiatic lions are solitary, or associate with up to three males, forming a loose pride. Pairs of males rest, hunt and feed together, and display marking behaviour at the same sites. Females associate with up to 12 females, forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. They share large carcasses among each other, but seldom with males. Female and male lions usually associate only for a few days when mating, but rarely live and feed together.\nResults of a radio telemetry study indicate that annual home ranges of male lions vary from 144 to 230 km2 (56 to 89 sq mi) in dry and wet seasons. Home ranges of females are smaller, varying between 67 and 85 km2 (26 and 33 sq mi). During hot and dry seasons, they favour densely vegetated and shady riverine habitats, where prey species also congregate.\nCoalitions of males defend home ranges containing one or more female prides. Together, they hold a territory for a longer time than single lions. Males in coalitions of three to four individuals exhibit a pronounced hierarchy with one male dominating the others.\nThe lions in Gir National Park are active at twilight and by night, showing a high temporal overlap with sambar (Rusa unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus).\nFeeding ecology [ edit ]\nIn general, lions prefer large prey species within a weight range of 190 to 550 kg (420 to 1,210 lb), irrespective of their availability. Domestic cattle have historically been a major component of the Asiatic lions' diet in the Gir Forest. Inside Gir Forest National Park, lions predominantly kill chital (Axis axis), sambar deer, nilgai, cattle (Bos taurus), domestic water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), and less frequently wild boar. They most commonly kill chital, which weighs only around 50 kg (110 lb). They prey on sambar deer when the latter descend from the hills during summer. Outside the protected area where wild prey species do not occur, lions prey on water buffalo and cattle, and rarely on dromedary (Camelus dromedarius). They generally kill most prey less than 100 m (330 ft) away from water bodies, charge prey from close range and drag carcasses into dense cover. They regularly visit specific sites within the protected area to scavenge on dead livestock dumped by Maldhari livestock herders. During dry, hot months, they also prey on mugger crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) on the banks of Kamleshwar Dam.: 148\nIn 1974, the Forest Department estimated the wild ungulate population at 9,650 individuals. In the following decades, the wild ungulate population has grown consistently to 31,490 in 1990 and 64,850 in 2010, including 52,490 chital, 4,440 wild boar, 4,000 sambar, 2,890 nilgai, 740 chinkara (Gazella bennetti), and 290 four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis). In contrast, populations of domestic buffalo and cattle declined following resettlement, largely due to direct removal of resident livestock from the Gir Conservation Area. The population of 24,250 domestic livestock in the 1970s declined to 12,500 by the mid-1980s, but increased to 23,440 animals in 2010. Following changes in both predator and prey communities, Asiatic lions shifted their predation patterns. Today, very few livestock kills occur within the sanctuary, and instead most occur in peripheral villages. Depredation records indicate that in and around the Gir Forest, lions killed on average 2,023 livestock annually between 2005 and 2009, and an additional 696 individuals in satellite areas.\nDominant males consume about 47% more from kills than their coalition partners. Aggression between partners increases when coalitions are large, but kills are small.\nReproduction [ edit ]\nLions mating in Gir Forest A pride of adult lions and their cubs\nAsiatic lions mating\nAsiatic lions mate foremost between October and November. Mating lasts three to six days. During these days, they usually do not hunt, but only drink water. Gestation lasts about 110 days. Litters comprise one to four cubs. The average interval between births is 24 months, unless cubs die due to infanticide by adult males or because of diseases and injuries. Cubs become independent at the age of about two years. Subadult males leave their natal pride latest at the age of three years and become nomads until they establish their own territory. Dominant males mate more frequently than their coalition partners. During a study carried out between December 2012 and December 2016, three females were observed switching mating partners in favour of the dominant male. Monitoring of more than 70 mating events showed that females mated with males of several rivaling prides that shared their home ranges, and that these males were tolerant toward the same cubs. Only new males that entered the female territories killed unfamiliar cubs. Young females mated foremost with males within their home ranges. Older females selected males at the periphery of their home ranges.\nThreats [ edit ]\nThe Asiatic lion currently exists as a single subpopulation, and is thus vulnerable to extinction from unpredictable events, such as an epidemic or large forest fire. There are indications of poaching incidents in recent years, as well as reports that organized poacher gangs have switched attention from local Bengal tigers to the Gujarat lions. There have also been a number of drowning incidents, after lions fell into wells.\nPrior to the resettlement of Maldharis, the Gir forest was heavily degraded and used by livestock, which competed with and restricted the population sizes of native ungulates. Various studies reveal tremendous habitat recovery and increases in wild ungulate populations following the resettlement of Maldharis since the 1970s.\nNearly 25 lions in the vicinity of Gir Forest were found dead in October 2018. Four of them had died because of canine distemper virus, the same virus that had also killed several lions in the Serengeti.\nConflicts with humans [ edit ]\nSince the mid 1990s, the Asiatic lion population has increased to an extent that by 2015, about a third resided outside the protected area. Hence, conflict between local residents and wildlife also increased. Local people protect their crops from nilgai, wild boar, and other herbivores by using electrical fences that are powered with high voltage. Some consider the presence of predators a benefit, as they keep the herbivore population in check. But some also fear the lions, and killed several in retaliation for attacks on livestock.\nIn July 2012, a lion dragged a man from the veranda of his house and killed him about 50\u201360 km (31\u201337 mi) from Gir Forest National Park. This was the second attack by a lion in this area, six months after a 25-year-old man was attacked and killed in Dhodadar.\nConservation [ edit ]\nPanthera leo persica was included on CITES Appendix I, and is fully protected in India.\nReintroduction [ edit ]\nProposed reintroduction sites in India. Pink spots indicate former populations, blue spots indicate proposed sites.\nIndia [ edit ]\nIn the 1950s, biologists advised the Indian government to re-establish at least one wild population in the Asiatic lion's former range to ensure the population's reproductive health and to prevent it from being affected by an outbreak of an epidemic. In 1956, the Indian Board for Wildlife accepted a proposal by the Government of Uttar Pradesh to establish a new sanctuary for the envisaged reintroduction, Chandra Prabha Wildlife Sanctuary, covering 96 km2 (37 sq mi) in eastern Uttar Pradesh, where climate, terrain and vegetation is similar to the conditions in the Gir Forest. In 1957, one male and two female wild-caught Asiatic lions were set free in the sanctuary. This population comprised 11 animals in 1965, which all disappeared thereafter.\nThe Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project to find an alternative habitat for reintroducing Asiatic lions was pursued in the early 1990s. Biologists from the Wildlife Institute of India assessed several potential translocation sites for their suitability regarding existing prey population and habitat conditions. The Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Madhya Pradesh was ranked as the most promising location, followed by Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary and Darrah National Park. Until 2000, 1,100 families from 16 villages had been resettled from the Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, and another 500 families from eight villages were expected to be resettled. With this resettlement scheme the protected area was expanded by 345 km2 (133 sq mi).\nGujarat state officials resisted the relocation, since it would make the Gir Sanctuary lose its status as the world's only home of the Asiatic lion. Gujarat raised a number of objections to the proposal, and thus the matter went before the Indian Supreme Court. In April 2013, the Indian Supreme Court ordered the Gujarat state to send some of their Gir lions to Madhya Pradesh to establish a second population there. The court had given wildlife authorities six months to complete the transfer. The number of lions and which ones to be transported will be decided at a later date. As of now, the plan to shift lions to Kuno is in jeopardy, with Madhya Pradesh having apparently given up on acquiring lions from Gujarat.\nIran [ edit ]\nIn 1977, Iran attempted to restore its lion population by transporting Gir lions to Arzhan National Park, but the project met resistance from the local population, and thus it was not implemented. However, this did not stop Iran from seeking to bring back the lion. In February 2019, Tehran Zoological Garden obtained a male Asiatic lion from Bristol Zoo in the United Kingdom, followed in June by a female from Dublin Zoo. There are hopes for them to successfully reproduce.\nIn captivity [ edit ]\nUntil the late 1990s, captive Asiatic lions in Indian zoos were haphazardly interbred with African lions confiscated from circuses, leading to genetic pollution in the captive Asiatic lion stock. Once discovered, this led to the complete shutdown of the European and American endangered species breeding programs for Asiatic lions, as its founder animals were captive-bred Asiatic lions originally imported from India and were ascertained to be intraspecific hybrids of African and Asian lions. In North American zoos, several Indian-African lion crosses were inadvertently bred, and researchers noted that \"the fecundity, reproductive success, and spermatozoal development improved dramatically.\"\nDNA fingerprinting studies of Asiatic lions have helped in identifying individuals with high genetic variability, which can be used for conservation breeding programs.\nIn 2006, the Central Zoo Authority of India stopped breeding Indian-African cross lions stating that \"hybrid lions have no conservation value and it is not worth to spend resources on them\". Now only pure native Asiatic lions are bred in India.\nIn 1972 the Sakkarbaug Zoo sold a pair of young pure-stock lions to the Fauna Preservation Society; which decided they would be accommodated at the Jersey Wildlife Trust where it was hoped to begin a captive breeding programme.\nThe Asiatic lion International Studbook was initiated in 1977, followed in 1983 by the North American Species Survival Plan (SSP). The North American population of captive Asiatic lions was composed of descendants of five founder lions, three of which were pure Asian and two were African or African-Asian hybrids. The lions kept in the framework of the SSP consisted of animals with high inbreeding coefficients.\nIn the early 1990s, three European zoos imported pure Asiatic lions from India: London Zoo obtained two pairs; the Z\u00fcrich Zoologischer Garten one pair; and the Korkeasaari Zoo in Helsinki one male and two females. In 1994, the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for Asiatic lions was initiated. The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) published the first European Studbook in 1999. By 2005, there were 80 Asiatic lions kept in the EEP \u2014 the only captive population outside of India. As of 2009, more than 100 Asiatic lions were kept within the EEP. The SSP had not resumed; pure-bred Asiatic lions are needed to form a new founder population for breeding in American zoos.\nIn culture [ edit ]\nSouth and East Asia [ edit ]\nNeolithic cave paintings of lions were found in Bhimbetka rock shelters in central India, which are at least 30,000 years old.\nThe Sanskrit word for 'lion' is '\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939' si\u1e43ha\u1e25, which is also a name of Shiva and signifies the Leo of the Zodiac. The Sanskrit name of Sri Lanka is Sinhala meaning 'Abode of Lions'. Singapore derives its name from the Malay words singa 'lion' and pura 'city', which in turn is from the Sanskrit '\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939' si\u1e43ha\u1e25 and \u092a\u0941\u0930 pur, latter also meaning 'fortified town'.\nIn Hindu mythology, the half man half lion avatar Narasimha is the fourth incarnation of Vishnu. Simhamukha is a lion-faced protector and dakini in Tibetan Buddhism.\nIn the 18th book of the Mahabharata, Bharata deprives lions of their prowess. The lion plays a prominent role in The Fables of Pilpay that were translated into Persian, Greek and Hebrew languages between the 8th and 12th centuries. The lion is the symbol of Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara in Jainism.\nWest Asia and Europe [ edit ]\nLions are depicted on vases dating to about 2600 before present that were excavated near Lake Urmia in Iran. The lion was an important symbol in Ancient Iraq and is depicted in a stone relief at Nineveh in the Mesopotamian Plain.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]"}

It can reach 6 to 10 inches in length and between 17 and 24 pounds in weight. Golden lion tamarin has 12 to 15 inches long tail.\nGolden lion tamarin is covered with orange (golden) fur. Its tail and forepaws are brown in color.\nGolden lion tamarins are not close relatives of lions. They are named that way because they have manes.\nThumbs of golden lion tamarins are not fully opposable and their big toes are positioned backward. These features are not seen in other monkeys.\nGolden lion tamarin spends its life in the trees (arboreal animal). Unlike other monkeys, it doesn't have prehensile tail (it moves without using the tail).\nGolden lion tamarin is diurnal animal (active during the day).\nGolden lion tamarin sleeps in the holes in trees during the night.\nGolden lion tamarin is an omnivore (animal that consumes plants and other animals). It eats fruit, flowers, nectar, eggs, insects, amphibians, reptiles and birds. Long digits and sharp claws facilitate extraction of invertebrates hidden in holes in the trees.\nMain predators of golden lion tamarins are wild cats, birds of prey and snakes.\nGolden lion tamarin lives in a family group composed of dominant male, female and their offspring. Group usually consists of 2 to 8 members.\nGolden lion tamarins use various sounds for communication. Social bonds are maintained via grooming and sharing of food. Older members of the group will give their food to the younger members.\nGolden lion tamarins occupy territory of 100 acres. They use scent marks and songs to advertise their presence on a certain territory. They will defend it fiercely against all intruders.\nMating season takes place from September to March. During fruitful seasons, females can have two offspring in a single year.\nPregnancy in females lasts 4.5 months and ends with 2 babies. All members of the group take care of the babies. Father plays the most important role and carries the babies on his back between the feedings. Only 50% of babies survive their first year of life."}

Named because its orange and gold bell and tentacles remind people of the color and texture of a lion\u2019s mane, this animal can have a bell as much as 7 feet across and tentacles 100 feet long. Yet, it is made up almost entirely of water and has a little lifespan. Read on for more facts about the lion\u2019s mane jellyfish.\nFive Incredible Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Facts!\nHere are five fascinating facts about the sea blubber:\nLion\u2019s mane jellyfish found in the south are considerably smaller than those found in the far north.\nIt can have as many as 1200 tentacles.\nThough its tentacles are full of stinging cells, many types of marine life hitch a ride on the lion\u2019s mane jelly to be protected from predators and to share the jellyfish\u2019s food.\nIt makes up much of the diet of the leatherback sea turtle, which seems immune to its sting.\nTentacles can sting even when they\u2019re at a location far from the jellyfish, so beware.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Classification and Scientific name\nThis jellyfish\u2019s scientific name is Cyanea capillata. Cyanea comes from kuan\u00f3s, the Greek word for \u201cblue-green.\u201d Others claim it is Latin for a pair of rocky islands. Capillata is Latin for \u201clong hair,\u201d which describes the jellyfish\u2019s very long tentacles. It is the only species in its genus.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Appearance\nThe lion\u2019s mane jelly\u2019s appearance is unmistakable. It can have a bell that\u2019s nearly 7 feet around and trail tentacles that are over 100 feet long. Bearing eight lobes, the bell resembles a pattypan squash. Each lobe bears from 70 to 150 tentacles that are arranged in rows, and there\u2019s a balance organ in the spaces in between them. This is called the rhopalium and lets the jellyfish tell up from down and right from left. There are also organs for odors and light perception. The location of the mouth is in the center of the lobes and contains the animal\u2019s oral arms. These are frilled and full of nematodes, or stinging cells the jellyfish uses to stun its prey.\nThe bell and the orange arms are an orange or reddish color, much like the mane of a lion. They can also be shades of purple, pink, or violet. Despite all of this, the animal is at least 94 percent water.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish vs Human: Just How Big Are We Talking?\nThough there are photos that show a human being as a mere speck beside a grown lion\u2019s mane jellyfish, the size difference isn\u2019t that drastic. Most jellies have a bell that\u2019s about 0.98 to 2.62 feet in diameter with 6 to 8 foot long tentacles.\nA Lion\u2019s mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) swims next to a kelp forest off the coast of Monterey, California. This giant stinging jelly can grow huge with tentacles reaching over 100 ft long. Ethan Daniels/Shutterstock.com\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Distribution, Population and Habitat\nThe jellyfish are found in the colder parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Other locations are in the Baltic and the North Sea. Some are found off the coast of Australia. They are rarely found in water deeper than 66 feet.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Predators and Prey\nGrown lion\u2019s mane jellyfish are too big and venomous for predators to tackle, but the much smaller juveniles are just the thing for sea birds, sea anemones, larger jellyfish, sea turtles, and big fish such as molas. As for their prey, the adult jellyfish eats a great variety of marine animals. These include the nearly microscopic animals that make up the zooplankton, shrimp and other small crustaceans, small fish, and moon jellyfish.\nThe jellyfish hunts by lowering itself upon its prey then paralyzing it with the stinging cells in its tentacles. How the jellyfish eats after it\u2019s caught its prey is complicated and requires the motion of the tentacles transferring the prey to the jelly\u2019s oral arm which then passes it to the manbrium, which is like an esophagus, then to the stomach. If the prey is too large for the stomach, the jellyfish uses its oral arms to start digesting it.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Reproduction and Lifespan\nAs with all jellyfish, this jellyfish\u2019s reproductive strategy is even more complicated than its digestive strategy. Though some biologists believe the animal is asexual, there are indeed male and female lion\u2019s mane jellyfish as one produces sperm and the other eggs. But its reproduction is both sexual and asexual.\nFirst, the jellyfish ejects sperm and eggs from the mouth. When they are fertilized, they are incubated in the oral tentacles of the female for about a day. This is how long it takes for them to hatch into planula larvae. The female then removes them to a firm surface where they develop further into tiny plantlike creatures called polyps. These polyps reproduce asexually through producing columns of disks called ephyrae. These ephyrae then break out of the columns and grow into medusae, which are basically tiny jellyfish. These medusae grow until they too are ready to reproduce sexually. Though the rule of thumb is that the larger an animal is the longer it lives, the lifespan of this huge jellyfish is about a year or even less.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish in Fishing and Cooking\nThough sea turtles love lion\u2019s mane jellyfish, their stinging nematodes make handling the cnidarian too hazardous for humans.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Population\nThough biologists don\u2019t have precise numbers of this jellyfish, its population is robust enough to sustain the population of the leatherback turtle. Lion\u2019s mane jellies are just about all the turtle eats. The IUCN hasn\u2019t evaluated the jellyfish, but it is not in danger of extinction.\nView all 55 animals that start with L"}

Much of this random knowledge gets lost in the ether, leaving us to speculate about things like dinosaur divorce rates or amphibian dance moves. But we still catch an awful lot, providing us with plenty of interesting\u2014if not always actionable\u2014facts about our fellow fauna.\nThe list below is a tribute to such trivia. From extinct penguins to newly identified wasps, these tidbits reflect the depth of our own species' curiosity about nature\u2014and our skill in shedding new light on it. As you peruse these facts, imagine all that went into discovering each one. We embrace their randomness here, but most hail from a robust body of knowledge about the animal in question.\nSo without further ado, here are 36 random animal facts that may interest you.\nAnatomy\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n1. Octopuses have three hearts. One pumps blood around the body, while the other two pump it to the gills. Oh, and that blood is blue, thanks to high copper levels!\n2. Owls don't have eyeballs. They have eye tubes.\n3. Polar bears have black skin. This helps it to absorb heat from the sun to stay warm in an Arctic climate, and it likely protects the bear from harmful UV rays.\n4. A human brain operates on about 15 watts.\nAbilities\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n5. Butterflies can taste with their feet, using something called chemoreceptors that help them to identify plants. Females select the correct leaf on which to lay eggs by \"drumming\" it with her feet to release juices.\n6. Animals with smaller bodies and faster metabolism see in slow motion.\n7. Dogs' sense of smell is about 100,000 times stronger than humans', but they have just one-sixth our number of taste buds.\n8. Reindeer eyeballs turn blue in winter to help them see at lower light levels. (They're golden-colored in summer.) No other mammals are known to have this ability.\n9. A single strand of spider silk is thinner than a human hair, but also five times stronger than steel of the same width. A rope just 2 inches thick could reportedly stop a Boeing 747.\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n10. The claws of a mantis shrimp can accelerate as quickly as a .22-caliber bullet. Scientists must keep them in thick plastic tanks because their punches can break glass.\n11. A sea lion is the first nonhuman mammal with a proven ability to keep a beat. A female sea lion named Ronan was trained to do it by scientists, who then showed she could transfer that skill to a song with a different beat that she had not heard before.\n12. Squirrels can't burp or vomit. Nor can any other rodent. This happens to be why rat poison is so effective; other mammals tend to expel any toxic substance they ingest.\n13. The extinct colossus penguin stood as tall as LeBron James.\n14. Honeybees can flap their wings 200 times every second.\nSurvival and Adaptation\n15. A type of \"immortal\" jellyfish is capable of cheating death indefinitely.\n16. Cats and horses are highly susceptible to black widow venom, but dogs are relatively resistant. Sheep and rabbits are apparently immune.\n17. Sharks kill fewer than 10 people per year. Humans kill about 100 million sharks per year. They should be much more scared of us than we are of them.\n18. Tardigrades are extremely durable microscopic animals that exist all over Earth. They can survive any of the following: 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 Celsius), -458 degrees F (-272 C), the vacuum of space, pressure six times stronger than the ocean floor and more than a decade without food.\nBehavior\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n19. Wild dolphins call each other by name. They let out a unique whistle to identify each other and will respond if they hear their own call played back.\n20. Young goats pick up accents from each other. This means they join humans, bats, and whales as mammals known to adjust their vocal sound to fit into a new social group.\n21. Humpback whale songs spread like \"cultural ripples from one population to another.\"\n22. Elephants have a specific alarm call that means \"human.\"\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n23. There's a place on Earth where seagulls prey on right whales. They dive-bomb the calves that are coming up to breathe air and take bites of blubber out of their backs. The calves' skin is thinner than adults' and they have to come up for air more frequently, making them more exposed and vulnerable to attack.\n24. Horses use facial expressions to communicate with each other. Researchers have identified 17 discrete facial movements in horses.\n25. Azara's owl monkeys are more monogamous than humans. They live together as families, with two parents and offspring, for up to nine years or when one of them dies. Fathers are highly involved in caring for their young.\n26. Male gentoo and Adelie penguins \"propose\" to females by giving them a pebble. These are precious because the penguins use them to build their nests, and they can be hard to find along the barren Antarctic shoreline. If the female accepts the pebble, the pair bonds and mates for life.\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n27. Barn owls are normally monogamous, but about 25% of mated pairs \"divorce.\" They do so if breeding is unsuccessful.\n28. African buffalo herds display voting behavior, in which individuals register their travel preference by standing up, looking in one direction and then lying back down. Only adult females can vote.\n29. If a honeybee keeps waggle-dancing in favor of an unpopular nesting site, other workers headbutt her to help the colony reach a consensus.\n30. The bone-house wasp stuffs the walls of its nest with dead ants.\nBonus Weird Animal Facts\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n31. Less time separates the existence of humans and the Tyrannosaurus rex than the T-rex and the stegosaurus.\n32. Animals have some unusual group names. For instance, a group of parrots is known as a pandemonium. Buffalo form an \"obstinacy\" and rhinoceroses a \"crash.\" You may have heard of a \"murder\" of crows, but what about an \"exaltation\" of larks?\n33. Warmer weather causes more turtles to be born female than male.\n34. A supercolony of invasive Argentine ants, known as the \"California large,\" covers 560 miles of the U.S. west coast. It's currently engaged in a turf war with a nearby supercolony in Mexico.\n35. By eating pest insects, bats save the U.S. agriculture industry an estimated $3.7 to $53 billion per year.\n36. Fourteen new species of dancing frogs were discovered in 2014, raising the global number of known dancing-frog species to 24."}

Alligators and lion have high power and abilities that can give a tough fight to their predators. Animals fight is always exciting to watch. Similarly, a lion vs. Alligator fight will be interesting to watch. But before that, let us compare the behavior and various facts about lion and alligator.\nWhat Does an Alligator Look Like?\nAlligators are often confused with crocodiles as both look much similar and belongs to the same order Crocodilia. However, they can be distinguished by its rounded snout, and by the fact that when their jaws are closed, none of their lower teeth are visible. Their body consists of thick scales, long and powerful tail, webbed feet with robust limbs. The eyes are situated on the top of their head, enabling them to breathe underwater while watching their prey.\nWhere Do Alligators Live?\nAlligators are endemic to the United States, and china and the habitat of these reptiles depend on their species. The American alligator can be seen in the southeast United States, including Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. They are usually inherited in freshwater, slow-moving rivers and can be seen in marshes, lakes, and swamps. Chinese alligators are found only in the Yangtze River valley and some parts of adjacent provinces.\nHow Many Species of Alligators are There?\nThere are two species of the alligators-the American alligator and the Chinese alligator.\nAlso read about donkey and mule.\nWhat is the Size of the Alligator?\nBetween the two species, American and Chinese, the American is the bigger one. An adult American alligator measures 13.1 feet and weighs around 790 pounds. However, sometimes they can even grow to 14 feet and weigh more than 990 pounds. The Chinese alligator being the smallest one measures 5 feet and weighs around 80 pounds. However, some larger males are known to reach 7 feet and weigh more than 100 pounds.\nWhat Do Alligators Eat?\nAlligators are opportunistic hunters and eat almost anything they catch. When the alligators are young, they feed fish, insects, snails, worms, and crustaceans. When they grew up, their diet includes large fish, deer, and other reptiles.\nAlligator\u2019s Reproduction:\nThe mating season in alligators is in late spring, usually in April and May. In summers, the female built nest of vegetation where the decomposition provides the heat needed to incubate the eggs. The gender of offspring is determined by the temperature in the nest and fixed from seven to 21 days of incubation\u2019s start. If the incubation temperature is 30 degrees C or lower produce a clutch of females while that temperature of 34 degrees C or more provides males. The female protects the newborns from predators, including raccoons, bobcats, birds, and even other alligators.\nFacts About Alligators:\nThe name alligator is derived from the Spanish term for the lizard.\nThe Chinese alligator differs from the American alligators. Chinese alligators have smaller heads, which is robust, and its snout is slightly upside-down.\nAmerican alligators lack bony belly plates; also, the eyelids of Chinese alligators have a thin plate required in American alligators.\nChinese alligators have 72 to 76 teeth, whereas American alligators have 74 to 80 teeth.\nBoth the reptiles have strong jaw muscles, which enable them to bite and grip their prey.\nThe large alligators have eyes that will glow red while it glows green in smaller alligators.\nThe American alligator species is the giant reptiles in the western hemisphere.\nThe American alligator is also the official reptile of three states- Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\nHow Long Do Alligators Live?\nIn the wild, the average lifespan of alligators is up to 50 years.\nAre Alligators Endangered?\nUnder the IUCN, the Chinese alligators are listed as endangered species, while the American alligators are least concerned. The primary threat to these reptiles is humans as they raise alligators for commercial use for their meat and skin, which is used in producing bags and shoes. Also, their meat is consumed by humans.\nWhat Does a Lion Look Like?\nThe African lion is a big wild cat with short beige-colored fur and white underparts. Their long tail ends with a black tuft. The male lions have a mane that ranges in color from black to blond. Their manes make them look larger than they are and also helps them threaten their predators. However, young lions have a grayish coat that is covered with brown markings and gets disappeared by the age of 3 months.\nWhere Does a Lion Live?\nLions can be found in various habitats, including grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of Sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the Asian lions are widely distributed in the Wildlife Sanctuary of western Gujarat.\nHow Many Species of Lions are There?\nThere are no species of lion, but there are different types of lions, they are-\nAsiatic lion\nBarbary lion\nWestern African lion\nNortheast Congo lion\nMasai lion\nKatanga lion\nTransvaal lion\nCape lion\nWhite lion\nWhat is The Size of a Lion?\nThe body length of a male lion is 72 to 82 inches, and females reach from 63 to 72 inches. However, a male lion weighs around 400 pounds, and the female weighs approximately 290 pounds. Although the heaviest lion recorded was about 826 pounds.\nWhat Do Lions Eat?\nLions are carnivorous and hunt for large animals such as zebras, antelopes, gazelles, deer, buffaloes, warthogs, wildebeests, and young elephants, and sometimes they might hunt small hares and birds. These large cats can also consume the meat of dead animals.\nAlso read about turtle and tortoise.\nLion\u2019s Reproduction:\nA male lion can mate with several females and can breed throughout the year. The gestation period in female lions lasts for 110 to 119 days, delivering 3 to 6 cubs. The mother hides the cubs in a solitary nursery. All the females of the pride nurse, protect, and care for the cubs. The cubs stay close to their mother for two years.\nFacts About Lion:\nLions are social creatures that live in a group known as pride, the pride consist of few females with their offspring and one or two males.\nWhile resting, the members of the pride display social behavior by spending their time together and strengthening their bonds.\nWithout their manes, lions and tigers look similar, and it will be hard to differentiate between the two as their body structure is also identical.\nThe male lion is the only having a mane, which gives it the title of \u2018king of the beasts.\u2019\nLions are the second-largest species of feline behind tigers.\nWhen these animals walk, their heels do not touch the ground because of their legs.\nHow Long Do Lions Live?\nIn the wild, lions can survive for 10 to 14 years, whereas in captivity, they can live for 20 to 25 years.\nAre Lions Endangered?\nUnder the IUCN red list, the Asian lions are listed as endangered species, while the African lions are classified as vulnerable.\nLion Versus Alligator: Fight comparison\nAs both alligators and crocodiles are healthy animals and are capable enough to use their intelligence. It would be hard to conclude that who would win an alligator or a lion. In most situations, the lion easily wins over an alligator, but sometimes alligators can drag the lion in the water where alligators have more chances of winning.\nAlso read honey badger vs lion comparison."}

While lions are inactive up to 21 hours a day, in the darkest, coolest hours of early morning the \"queens of beasts\" hunt as a team to catch a communal meal. Pride lionesses frequently enter breeding season together and later give birth at the same time which allows them to share nursing and other maternal duties. Although only one out of four hunting events is successful, dominant males always eat first, lionesses next, and cubs scramble for scraps and leftovers.\nEcology and Conservation\nLions are the largest African carnivores and a hungry lion pride feeds on many animals that pass through or share its home range. As specialized communal predators, a pride's role includes keeping herbivore populations in balance with the resources available in their area of the plains.\nBibliography\nBenyus, Janine M.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion", "text": "The lion (Panthera leo) is a large mammal of the Felidae (cat) family. Some large males weigh over 250 kg (550 lb). Today, wild lions live in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia. Lions are adapted for life in grasslands and mixed areas with trees and grass. The relatively small females are fast runners over short distances, and coordinate their hunting of herd animals.\nLions have disappeared from North Africa and southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is now a vulnerable species. There was a decline in its African range of 30\u201350% over two decades in the second half of the 20th century. Habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.\nLions are often called the \"king of the beasts\". They are used as symbols representing courage. They appear in heraldry more often than any other animal. They are an icon of courage and royalty.\nLions live for 10 to 14 years when they are in the wild. When they are captured, they can live longer than 20 years. In the wild, males do not usually live longer than 10 years. This is because wounds from fighting with other males make their lives shorter. They usually live in savanna and grassland. These areas do have bushes and trees, but lions are mainly adapted to catch prey on grasslands. Compared to other cats, lions are social. A group of lions is called a pride. In a pride of lions, there are related females, their young, and one or two adult males. Groups of female lions often hunt together.\nLions are carnivores and scavengers. Lions are apex predators. Lions feed on antelope, buffalo, zebras, warthogs, wildebeest, birds, hares, turtles, fish, giraffes, and young elephants. Lions scavenge animals either dead from natural causes (disease) or killed by other predators. They keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, because this means there is a dead or injured animal close by.\nThey have an archetypal roar which is used to communicate with other group members and warn different intruders of territorial boundaries.\nThey have long, retractable claws which help the lion to grab and hold prey. They also have a rough tongue that helps them peel the skin of prey animals away from flesh and flesh away from bone. Across their belly, they have loose skin which allows the species to be kicked by prey with little chance of an injury.\nThere are about 30,000 lions left in the wild in Africa. Only 350 lions (of the Asiatic lion subspecies) are left in Asia. They live in the Gir Forest in the state of Gujarat, India.\nLions hunt many animals, such as gnus and antelopes. Male lions usually weigh between 150 and 250 kilograms (330 and 550 pounds). Large lions have reached 250 to 270 kg (550 to 600 lb). Females (lionesses) are usually 120 to 182 kg (265 to 401 lb). Mature male lions are the only cats with a mane. The lion has a long body, short legs, large claws, big head, and a yellowish-brown coat.\nLions live in groups that are called prides. 10 to 40 lions may live in a pride. Each pride has a home area that is called its territory. Lions do not allow other carnivores (meat-eating animals) to hunt in their territory. A territory can be as large as 260 square kilometres (100 square miles).\nThe lions' roar is distinct to each individual. It is used for territorial marking and warning off other lions in separate prides (or lone individuals). This however, is usually carried out by competing males. Other male lions will challenge the alpha of the pride to a fight in order to take their spot of dominance if they win. Lions actually have prides in order to strengthen their species throughout the generations (Boothalingam 2018).\nLions are not as built for extreme speed as cheetahs are, but hunt in packs. This is unusual in cats. The females usually do the hunting for the pride. However the males can sometimes help if needed, to take down large animals. After lions have brought down a prey, they suffocate it by biting the front of its face to prevent it breathing. Lions prey are zebra and deer. Lions also have long retractable claws which act like grappling hooks, to keep hold of the prey.\nEven though a lion is good at killing prey for food, they are not among the most dangerous animals for humans.\nA lioness is ready to have young when she is 2\u20133 years old. Young lions are called cubs. Cubs are born after 3 1/2 months. The cubs are born blind; their eyes do not open until they are about a week old, and cannot see well until they are about two weeks old. Lions do not have a den (home) where they would live for a long time. The lioness conceals the cubs in thick bush, gullies, or rocky outcrops. If the hiding place has been seen by other predators, then the lioness will move the cubs to a new hiding place. The cubs will be introduced to the pride at about 6 weeks old. The cubs are very vulnerable when the lioness goes out to hunt and needs to leave the cubs behind. Also, when a new male takes over a pride from another male, he usually kills all of the cubs. The cubs' mothers will then mate with the new pride male, which means that the first batch of new cubs will be his offspring. A litter of 2-6 cubs are born. Usually, only 1-2 cubs survive until introduced to the pride, at which point they are protected by the whole pride.\nIn zoos, lions have been known to breed with tigers. If the parents are a male lion and a female tiger, the offspring is called a liger. If the parents are a male tiger and a female lion, the offspring is called a tigon.\nLions in heraldry [ change | change source ]\nLions appear in heraldry more often than any other animal. They traditionally symbolise courage, valour and royalty.\nOther websites [ change | change source ]\nMedia related to Lion at Wikimedia Commons"}

Males are much larger at 53 to 72kg (116 to 158 pounds). From the head to the base of the tail cougars measure 2.8 to 5 feet (86 to 155cm) long. The tail adds 2-3 (60-97cm) to this length. At the shoulder they stand 60-90cm tall (24-35in)\nThe coat of the mountain lion is tawny. Around the muzzle the coat is white. The nose is a light pink in colour. Above the yellow eye is a black stripe and under is a white patch. Down the sides of the muzzle are some medium sized whiskers. On the underside of these animals the fur is lighter in colour.\nDiet\nThe cougar is a carnivore. They feed mostly on a diet of rabbits, hares, deer, elk, coyotes, porcupines, racoons and large birds. They are opportunistic feeders though and will take any prey animals which they can find.\nAfter a cougar has pounced on its prey they will kill it quickly with a bite to the neck. Once they are finished with the hunt they take the prey item to a bush eat what they want at that time and then bury this rest. This means instead of hunting a few days later they can go eat the rest of the carcass."}

They are native to Africa and India but can also be seen at zoos across the country. Lions are one of the most distinctive animals in the world with their large manes and loud roar. Learn more about these ferocious animals with these Lion Facts for Kids!\nLion\nClick here for more animal facts\nWhat is a Lion?\nThe lion is known as the \u201cKing of Beasts\u201d or \u201cKing of the Jungle.\u201d There are also phrases such as \u201cbrave as a lion\u201d or \u201cstrong as a lion.\u201d Lions` have been the symbol of strength and bravery for thousands of years.\nThe scientific name for a lion is panthera leo. They are part of the big cats family. Other big cat species include tigers, cheetahs, cougars, jaguars, leopards, and snow leopards.\nLions are the second-largest cat species in the entire world (tigers are number one).\nThere are one species of lion and two sub-species African Lion P and Asiatic Lion. one. African lions are native to African and Asiatic lions are a small population native to India. African lions are bigger than Asiatic lions.\nLions are predatory carnivores. This means that they hunt and kill animals to survive. Some of the animals they eat include zebras, giraffes, rhinos, Hippos, Deer, and other herd animals.\nA male is called a lion. A female is called a lioness and a baby is called a cub.\nWhere Do Lions Live?\nLion\u2019s are known as the king of the jungle, but they really don\u2019t live in jungles.\nA lion\u2019s habitat is in the savanna. A savanna is a flat grassy area with a small number of trees. Their habitats also include the open woodlands and grasslands when plenty of water can be found. African lions used to be found all over Africa, today. they are mostly found in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nAround 4,000 lions live in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania Serengeti National Park is a large wildlife preserve that is home to thousands of species, including lions, cheetahs, elephants, zebra, giraffe, hippos, hyenas, white rhino, black rhinos, elephants, and many species of birds.\nA small population of lions also lives in the Gir Forest National Park in Western India.\nAfrican Savanna\nWhat Do Lions Look Like?\nLions are really large. A full-grown male lion can weigh up to 560 pounds. A female is smaller weighing in at 300-350 pounds.\nMale lions on average are 10 feet long including their tail and stand about 4ft tall. Females are slightly smaller at 9 feet long.\nLions have strong powerful legs that help them run up to 36 mph. Lions can even make it up to 50 mph for short distances.\nOne of the easiest ways to tell female and male lions apart is from their mane. Males have manes and females do not.\nA mane is the long, thick hair around the lion\u2019s head. A lion\u2019s mane helps protect his head during fights. Large manes can intimidate other lions.\nA male lion\u2019s mane will start to grow at 18 months and will continue to grow as the lion grows.\nManes will often darken in color as the lion gets older.\nManes will help to protect the lion\u2019s neck when they are in fights.\nLion\u2019s coat is a golden brown color. Their manes can be a variety of colors including brown, reddish-brown, light brown, or even blonde or black.\nSocial Animals\nLions are social animals. As cubs, they will wrestle and play. As adults lions continue to be social.\nLions communicate in many different ways. Members of a pride will greet each other by rubbing their heads together.\nLions will mark their territory with their scent and urine. They do this so other lions outside their pride know that this area is taken.\nMale lions will also use their manes to communicate. A lion\u2019s mane is large, this is to stay \u201cI\u2019m strong, I\u2019m tough.\u201d to make sure everyone else around them knows this, a lion will sometimes strut back and forth holding its head up high.\nA lion will also communicate with its roar.\nLions playing together\nA Lion\u2019s Roar\nLions have the loudest roar of any cat in the entire world. Their roar is so loud that it can be heard up to 5 miles away! Lions roar for many different reasons.\nThey roar to declare a territory or show strength and to warn animals to stay away. Sometimes they will roar to call other lions. Sometimes a group of lions will roar together,\nLion Pride\nPride\nUnlike other cats, lions are social animals. Lions live in groups called prides. A pride consists of about 15-25 lions, but they sometimes have up to 40 lions. Usually 1-2 adult male lions, 12-15 lionesses, and cubs. The more males a pride has the better the chance for survival. The males\u2019 main duty is to protect the pride and their territory. The lionesses are usually the ones that hunt and provide food for the pride.\nWhen a male cub grows up, he will leave the pride, usually with his brothers. Adult male lions will roam the land for a while, then find a territory or pride to claim as their own. When female cubs grow up, they stay in the pride.\nHunters\nBoth male and female lions will hunt. In the pride, the lioness will hunt and the male lion\u2019s job is to protect the pride. Lions are predators and must hunt other animals to survive.\nLionesses will often hunt in groups. This is so they have a better chance of catching fast prey such as zebra.\nA Lion will hunt at night. Lions have an excellent sense of sight, smell, and hearing. They use these senses to track down their prey.\nLions will sneak up on their prey then attack. They will catch prey by grabbing them and pulling them down with their razor-sharp teeth.\nLion\u2019s teeth were made for tearing into the skin of their prey and not so much for chewing. A lion will often swallow big chunks of meat. They have thick, coarse tongues that help take the hair off the meat.\nIf there is a lot of food all members of the pride will eat together. Often times there isn\u2019t enough food when food is scarce the adult male lions will eat first, then the females, and lastly the cubs. Some cubs have died from starving to death.\nA lion will eat as much and he/she can in one meal. Sometimes eating up to 75 pounds at once. This is because lions do not eat every day. It may be several days before he/she will eat again.\nSleepy Lion\nLions sleep a lot. They can rest for up to 20 hours a day. Because lions live in such a hot climate they must try not to overheat. As humans, we sweat to cool off our bodies. Lions do not sweat like humans, this is why they spend so much of their day resting. Running around, playing, jumping can cause a lion\u2019s body to overheat, which is not good for a lion.\nA lion will find a nice play to rest under a tree, in the shadow of another lion, behind a rock, or anywhere they can find shade. A lion will often lay on its sides to cool off as its heat escapes its body well by the belly.\nThis is one of the reasons that lions hunt at night. They will hunt at night when the temperatures drop and the hot sun goes in.\nCubs\nLion Cub\nWhen a mother lioness is ready to have her cubs, she will leave the pride to find a safe place to give birth and care for her cubs for a couple of weeks of their life. A mother lioness will give birth to a litter of 1-4 lion cubs every two years.\nWhen a lion cub is born it is blind, can barely crawl, and have light spots on their fur. A new mother will only leave her cubs to get them food. When she leaves her cub, she makes sure that she leaves them hidden. Cubs can be prey for hyenas, jackals, snakes, and leopards.\nAfter about 12 weeks, lion cubs are now able to get around. The mother lioness will lead her cubs back to her pride. This is risky for the lioness because If the male members of the pride feel that they don\u2019t belong, they will kill them. If the members of the pride accept them, they will greet the new cubs.\nLion and cub\nCubs will continue to follow their mother and learn new things. They will learn hunting skills such as how to sneak up on and capture prey.\nCubs will also play with other cubs in the pride. They will play-fight and pounce on one another. Cubs have fun playing around.\nWhen cubs are about one year old they lose their baby teeth. Their adult sharp teeth will grow in their place. When their adult teeth come in, cubs will start to go out hunting with their mothers.\nAfter cubs have had practice hunting and are strong enough to hunt alone, their mothers will stop bringing them food. From this point on, cubs will have to go out and hunt on their own.\nLion Facts for Kids\nWhen a lion walks, its heels do not touch the ground.\nWe know that cats don\u2019t like water, is this true for lions? Unlike other cats, lions actually like water and are great swimmers.\nA lion has a long jump! In a single leap that can travel as far as 35 ft.\nWe all know Simba from Disney\u2019s Lion King. In Swahili (a language spoken in Africa), Simba means lion.\nLions live 12-15 years in the wild and 20-25 years in captivity. When animals are living in captivity it means they are living in a zoo, farm, or nature preserve.\nAfrican lions are considered vulnerable on the endangered species list.\nClick here to download the single lion coloring page.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "White Lion - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Lion", "text": "Danish/American glam metal band\nThis article is about the band. For other uses, see White Lion (disambiguation)\nWhite Lion was an American glam metal band that was formed in New York City in 1983 by Danish vocalist/guitarist Mike Tramp and American guitarist Vito Bratta. Mainly active in the 1980s and early 1990s, they released their debut album Fight to Survive in 1985. The band achieved success with their No. 8 hit \"Wait\" and No. 3 hit \"When the Children Cry\" from their second album, the double platinum selling Pride. The band continued their success with their third album, Big Game which achieved Gold status and their fourth album Mane Attraction which included a supporting tour. White Lion disbanded in 1992 and not long after their first compilation album, The Best of White Lion was released.\nMike Tramp reformed White Lion with all new musicians in 1999 and again in 2004, following a failed attempt to reform the original line up. The new White Lion released a live album in 2005 and a brand new studio album Return of the Pride in 2008.\nBiography [ edit ]\nFight to Survive [ edit ]\nAfter moving from Denmark to Spain and then New York City, vocalist Mike Tramp (formerly of the bands Mabel, Studs, and Danish Lions) met Staten Island guitarist Vito Bratta (formerly of Dreamer) in 1983. They decided to put together a new band and recruited drummer Nicki Capozzi and bassist Felix Robinson (formerly of Angel) and named the group White Lion.\nWhite Lion was signed by Elektra Records in 1984 and recorded their debut album Fight to Survive. Elektra was unhappy with the final recording, and after refusing to release the album, terminated the band's contract.\nThe album Fight to Survive was eventually released by Victor Company of Japan, Ltd, (JVC Records) in Japan in 1985. Philadelphia-based Grand Slamm Records bought the album from Elektra and released it in America the following year, under licensed by Elektra/Asylum Records. A few months later, Grand Slamm Records went bankrupt.\nFight to Survive charted at number 151 on Billboard 200 and featured the band's debut single and music video, \"Broken Heart\".\nIn 1985, Felix Robinson departed after they were dropped by Elektra and was replaced by bassist Dave Spitz (brother of Anthrax guitarist Dan Spitz). With the Tramp, Bratta, Capozzi, Spitz line-up, the band recorded a round of demos and continued to play shows in New York while shopping around for a new record deal. This incarnation of White Lion was hired to play a fictional band in the Tom Hanks/Shelley Long movie The Money Pit, which was released a year later. The soundtrack features the song \"Web of Desire\" (credited to \"White Lion and Robey (portrayed by Louise Robey), which was demoed that year. The film soundtrack was never officially released although the song plays in the movie during both of their scenes.\nDave Spitz left at the end of 1985 to join Black Sabbath, and was replaced by James LoMenzo. Nicki Capozzi was subsequently fired and replaced by former Anthrax drummer Greg D'Angelo.\nPride [ edit ]\nEarly in 1987, the band was signed by Atlantic Records. The recording of the album took six weeks and on June 21, 1987 their album Pride was released. The first single, \"Wait\", was released on June 1, 1987, but did not reach the charts for nearly seven months.\nThe Pride tour started in July 1987 as White Lion opened for Frehley's Comet. The next year and a half was filled with constant touring, opening for such bands as Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne, Stryper and Kiss. In January 1988 White Lion landed the opening slot for AC/DC on their Blow Up Your Video American tour.\nWhile touring with AC/DC, the Pride album and \"Wait\" single finally charted, due in no small part to MTV airing the \"Wait\" music video in regular rotation\u2014nearly seven months after the single's release. \"Wait\" hit No. 8 on the singles chart, while Pride hit No. 11 on the album charts. Pride would remain on the Top 200 Billboard album charts for a full year, selling two million copies in the US alone and achieving double platinum status.\nIn August 1988, the album's second single, \"Tell Me\", reached No. 58. Around the time this single was released, White Lion played at the Ritz club in New York City. The show was filmed and later aired on MTV.\nThe Pride album's third single, a power ballad titled \"When the Children Cry\", made it to No. 3 on the charts with heavy MTV airplay.\nThe success of \"When the Children Cry\" would eventually push sales of Pride over the two million mark. In addition, Vito Bratta was recognized for his instrumental talents by racking up Best New Guitarist awards with both Guitar World magazine and Guitar for the Practicing Musician magazine. \"All You Need Is Rock 'n' Roll\" was the final single released from the album.\nIn the spring of 1989, the Pride tour finally ended, and the band released their first video albums titled \"Live at the Ritz\" and \"One Night in Tokyo\" both of which featuring full concerts on VHS.\nThe band then immediately began work on their next album.\nBig Game & Mane Attraction [ edit ]\nIn August 1989, White Lion released their third album, Big Game, a musically eclectic follow-up to Pride that featured the single \"Little Fighter\" (which peaked at No. 52), in Memory of The Rainbow Warrior, a Greenpeace boat which was destroyed by the French. A cover of Golden Earring's \"Radar Love\" (which peaked at No. 59) was released as the second single and \"Cry for Freedom\", a political song about apartheid in South Africa was released as the third single. \"Going Home Tonight\" was released as the album's final single. The album quickly went gold, with a peak of No. 19 on the album charts. The band's success continued with more constant touring.\nAfter two years of writing and recording, White Lion released their fourth album Mane Attraction in the spring of 1991. The album featured the singles \"Love Don't Come Easy\" which peaked at number 24 on The Mainstream Rock Charts, \"Lights and Thunder\" which is a eight-minute heavy rock epic with a complex structure inspired by Led Zeppelin\u2019s Achilles Last Stand. and a re-recorded version of the band's debut single \"Broken Heart\", all of which featured music videos. \"Out with the Boys\" and \"You're All I Need\" were released as promo singles and \"Farewell to You\" featured a music video montage. The album also contained White Lion's only instrumental song, \"Blue Monday\", a tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan, who had died while the band was writing the album. The album's two ballads \"You're All I Need\" and \"Till Death Do Us Part\" gained popular airplay in Indonesia and the Philippines.\nGreg D'Angelo and James LoMenzo left the band soon after the album's release, citing \"musical differences,\" but White Lion carried on with bassist Tommy T-Bone Caradonna and drummer Jimmy DeGrasso (Megadeth, Alice Cooper, Suicidal Tendencies, Y&T, Fiona).\nAfter briefly touring in support of Mane Attraction, Tramp and Bratta decided to fold the group, their last show being held in Boston at the Channel in September 1991. Exactly one year later, in September 1992, the band's first compilation album was released, titled The Best of White Lion. A Video/DVD album featuring concert footage, behind the scenes interviews and all of the band's music videos was also released, titled Escape from Brooklyn.\nWhen asked what the album would be like if he and Vito Bratta had released another album after Mane Attraction, Tramp said it would have hinted at their growth and evolution, and taken them further away from the '80s sound. He commented:\n\"I was kind of shocked cause to me it sounded like Vito and I weren't done working together and I was surprised that he never put up a fight when I said 'No more White Lion.' It was that he just lay down and gave up. I am not saying that White Lion would have continued if he and I had put up a fight. But I am sure that if we had sat down and talked and really looked at the picture and sorted out what had gone wrong and how much was our fault and how much was Kurt Cobain's, then there could possibly be a mature and musically serious band existing today, called White Lion.\"\nAfter White Lion [ edit ]\nJames LoMenzo and Greg D'Angelo joined Zakk Wylde's band, Lynyrd Skynhead, in the mid 1990s which became the band Pride & Glory when Greg D'Angelo was replaced by Brian Tichy. Pride & Glory released one album, then James LoMenzo left the band. James went on to record and tour with ex-Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth, Zakk Wylde's band Black Label Society, thrash metal pioneers Megadeth, and in 2013, joined John Fogerty's solo band.\nVito Bratta stayed briefly with Atlantic Records to help produce an album for CPR, and later tried to form a new music group that never panned out. Despite a dedicated worldwide following of guitar aficionados, Vito disappeared from public view from 1994 until his interview by Eddie Trunk live on February 16, 2007. Vito is the sole owner of the White Lion music catalog, retaining the legal and distributive rights to all four original albums. The material was licensed entirely to Bratta's Vavoom Music, Inc, when Tramp sold off his share in the mid 1990s.\nFreak of Nature [ edit ]\nMike Tramp went on to form the hard rock / heavy metal band Freak of Nature, The follow up was significantly heavier and darker than White Lion, featuring two guitar players and more visceral songs with a strong rhythmic foundation. The band released three albums between 1992 and 1998, Freak of Nature, Gathering of Freaks, and Outcasts. The band shared stages with Helloween and Dio in Europe in 1993. Freak of Nature eventually disbanded in 1996. Tramp has often called Freak of Nature the best band he has been a part of and also said that he wanted to stray from the 80s sound and adopt a more 70s approach.\nMike Tramp solo career [ edit ]\nFollowing Freak of Nature, Tramp began a solo career, releasing his debut album as a solo artist in 1998 titled Capricorn. The album featured former Freak of Nature bandmates, guitarist Kenny Korade and bass player Jerry Best. Former White Lion bass guitarist James LoMenzo performed backing vocals on the album. The song \"Better Off\" was released as Tramp's debut solo single and features his first solo music video. The album also features the singles \"Already Gone\", \"If I Live Tomorrow\" and \"Take a Little Time\".\nIt would be five years before Tramp returned to the studio to record his follow-up album, Recovering the Wasted Years, during which time he would move to Australia, with the aim of raising his son away from the rigors of big city life and to plan his next career move. Recovering the Wasted Years was released in 2002 and featured the singles \"Living a Lie\"  and \"Endless Highway\" both featuring live music videos.\nIn 2003, Tramp followed-up with his third album, More to Life Than This, which Tramp once again produced himself but relied on producer/engineer Flemming Rasmussen (Metallica) to engineer and mix the sessions in his very own Sweet Silence Studios. The album's title track, \"More to Life Than This\", and \"Don't Want to Say Good Night\" were both released as singles. A music video made in Australia was released for the song \"Lay Down My Life For You\". Also in 2003, Tramp released the double disc live album Rock 'N' Roll Alive, which features Tramp performing live versions of songs from White Lion, Freak of Nature, and his solo albums.\nIn 2004, Tramp released the solo album Songs I Left Behind.\nThe new White Lion and legal issues [ edit ]\nIn 1999 after commencing his solo career, Mike Tramp, with all new musicians, also released Remembering White Lion, which featured new versions of some of White Lion's classic songs and started what would be a long battle to reform White Lion.\nIn 2000, momentum for a new White Lion continued with the release of a second best of album titled White Lion Hits followed by an updated White Lion compilation titled The Essential White Lion.\nIn October 2003, Tramp announced a White Lion reunion with the original members. This statement was quickly denied by the other former members. Later Tramp said that Vito Bratta wanted nothing to do with a reunion. With summer festivals in Europe already booked, Tramp attempted to put together a \"new White Lion\" featuring former members James LoMenzo and Jimmy DeGrasso, along with Warren DeMartini of Ratt. Vito Bratta filed suit claiming partial ownership of the name, and the tour was scrapped. Tramp later commented that despite his willingness, \"There will never be an original White Lion reunion\".\nIn 2004 due to legal issues, the album Remembering White Lion was re-released under the new title Last Roar featuring the band name Tramp's White Lion.\nIn late 2004, Mike Tramp organized another group of unknown musicians and continued with a new White Lion under the act Tramp's White Lion, this however did not stop the persistent legal issues with former members. Despite all the issues, 'TWL' (a.k.a. White Lion 2) played and re-recorded White Lion songs, touring and releasing a box set titled The Bootleg Series in 2004 and a double-live CD entitled Rocking the USA in 2005.\nThe band had several concerts cancelled in late 2005 as promoters backed away due to the threat of possible legal action and by the end of the year Tramp had almost completely given up on White Lion, but six months later was inspired to continue with the booking of a European tour for November and December 2006. Tramp's White Lion played several dates in Europe including Sweden, Norway, Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.\nIn 2005, a Concert Anthology DVD was released followed by the album Anthology in 2006 featuring never before released songs and demo versions of White Lion classic songs from previous albums.\nOn February 16, 2007, Vito Bratta appeared on the Eddie Trunk radio show in New York, stating that despite what Mike Tramp said, he had never refused a White Lion reunion, stating that the only reason he was unable to participate was due to the illness of his father. He added that he would still be open to the idea and has not closed the door to returning to the music industry again. Trunk made it clear that Bratta's involvement in the show was something that he had wanted to happen since White Lion first broke up in 1991. Bratta took calls and answered questions from fans for almost three hours. On April 6 and 7, 2007, at the L'Amours Reunion Shows in New York, Bratta made his first public musical appearances in over 15 years.\nThree weeks later Mike Tramp called the same show from Australia, speaking about Bratta and the band's new album, including the tour dates that Tramp's White Lion had recently confirmed. Tramp said that he was thankful that Bratta had finally answered fans' questions, the same questions he himself had been asked many times over the past 15 years. He also stated that he felt uncomfortable answering on Vito's behalf, and that he was upset that Vito had withdrawn himself from the music industry.[citation needed]\nMike Tramp in June 2008\nReturn of the Pride [ edit ]\nA White Lion compilation The Definitive Rock Collection was released in 2007 and the band was set for a summer tour with Poison and Ratt only to be dropped by the tour promoter after ex-White Lion guitarist Vito Bratta threatened to take legal action over the band name.\nIn response to the rumors surrounding the White Lion and Poison/Ratt summer tour, Tramp issued a statement explaining that tour promoters Live Nation's decision was not based on any controversy over whether Mike Tramp has the legal right to perform as White Lion. Live Nation's decision was based upon the threatened lawsuit by Vito Bratta. Even though Live Nation believed Bratta's lawsuit to be frivolous and had confirmed that Mike Tramp has the legal right to perform as White Lion, they did not want to spend 'one dollar' on litigation. Faced with the cancellation of a tour that was to begin within weeks, the band's attorneys negotiated a deal with Vito Bratta to drop his threatened lawsuit. However, even with the threat of litigation eliminated, Live Nation did not reinstate White Lion onto the tour. Extremely upset with the decision, Tramp acknowledged the many fans across the United States who were also disappointed by Live Nation's decision.\nDespite the threatened legal action and the band's removal from the Poison/Ratt tour, White Lion continued touring and fulfilled their many headline shows in the U.S. that were scheduled between the Poison shows, including the Rocklahoma festival with Poison, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Slaughter, Y&T, Gypsy Pistoleros, Dirty Penny, Greg Leon Invasion and Zendozer. Tramp also confirmed to MelodicRock.com that the band had just finished recording its new studio album and the CD would be mixed by Dennis Ward and titled Return of the Pride.\nThe new studio album entitled Return of the Pride was released on March 14, 2008 and the band was now once again simply known as White Lion.

The modern animal is well adapted to an aquatic environment, with its streamlined body and powerful flippers. (The rear flippers rotate forward to allow a California sea lion to move surprisingly well on land.) California sea lions also boast thick layers of blubber to insulate their bodies from the chill of marine waters.\nWhen diving deep, California sea lions slow their heart rates to allow them to remain underwater for nearly ten minutes before surfacing to breathe.

Lions are imposing cats that exhibit unrivaled teamwork among felines. These magnificent predators are world renowned, and for good reason! Read on to learn about the African lion.\nDescription of the African Lion\nAfrican lions are large, muscular, barrel-chested cats. They have a rounded head, round ears, short fur, and a long tail with a tuft of hair at the end. Male lions grow a luxurious collar of long hair, called a \u201cmane,\u201d around their necks.\nInteresting Facts About the African Lion\nLions are competent predators that work together to bring down prey. They have a number of distinctive behaviors and adaptations that help them survive in the harsh African savannah.\nMy Mane Man! \u2013 African lions\u2019 famous mane begins to grow when the male lion reaches one year of age.

Family Matters \u2013 A group of lions is known as a \u201cpride.\u201d Lion prides consist of a few male lions, approximately a dozen lionesses, and their cubs. All the female lions in a pride are related. The females will stay with the pride their entire lives, while the males search for a pride of their own when they reach sexual maturity.\n\u2013 A group of lions is known as a \u201cpride.\u201d Lion prides consist of a few male lions, approximately a dozen lionesses, and their cubs. All the female lions in a pride are related. The females will stay with the pride their entire lives, while the males search for a pride of their own when they reach sexual maturity. Teamwork Will Get You Dinner \u2013 Lions hunt in groups, and these groups are almost exclusively composed of lionesses, rather than male lions. Male lions can hunt, but do not typically participate in group hunts. Because the lionesses work together, they can capture prey that is much larger and faster than a single lioness could catch on her own.\nHabitat of the African Lion\nLions prefer grassland and savannah habitats in close proximity to water sources, such as rivers. They also prefer hunting in open areas, rather than densely packed forest. Lions are absent from all rainforest habitats in their range.\nDistribution of the African Lion\nAfrican lions have a number of subspecies separated by large, lion-less expanses. Historically, lions could be found across the vast majority of Africa, but their current range has been restricted to a smattering of locations in Central and Southern Africa.\nOutside of Africa, lions used to be found from Greece all the way to India. Humans slowly decimated these populations over the centuries. Currently, only a small population of the Asiatic lion subspecies can be found in the Gir Forest National Park in Western India.\nDiet of the African Lion\nLions are considered a hypercarnivore, which means that the vast majority (70%) of their diet comes from meat. They seem to prefer prey that weighs between 400 \u2013 1,200 lbs. but will occasionally eat outside of that range. Some of their most common prey includes wildebeest, zebra, gemsbok, giraffe, buffalo, Thomson\u2019s gazelle, and warthog. Each lion is thought to eat between 10 and 20 lbs. of food per day.\nThe Protection of Family\nWhile female lions bring home dinner, male lions survey their territory and chase away rival males. Groups of male lions at the head of a pride have more success maintaining dominance than a single male does. Adult male lions are larger and heavier than females, making them the obvious choice in primary pride protection. Male lions will mark their territory by scent marking and roaring.\nRoaming bachelor males will attempt to de-throne the current male(s) of the pride. These battles can be vicious, and for good reason. The male lion is not only defending his harem of females, but also his genetic progeny. When a new male takes over a pride, he kills all the young cubs in the pride. It is believed this occurs because the lionesses will not go into heat until her cubs mature or die.\nAfrican Lion and Human Interaction\nHumans and lions interact in a number of different ways, most of them negative for either the lion or the human. Lion hunting has been a recorded human hobby since 1380 B.C. Inscriptions from ancient Egyptian Pharaohs detail the hunting of lions and the number of kills. In some African cultures the killing of a lion is even seen as a right of passage.\nLion hunting occurs now in the form of trophy hunts, as well as the illegal killing of \u201cpest\u201d lions. Livestock \u2013 being easy prey, especially when other prey is scarce \u2013 can become the target of lion hunts. When lions or other predators kill human livestock, the interaction usually results in the hunting and killing of all predators in the area.\nDomestication\nLions have not been domesticated, but they have been successfully bred in zoos for a number of years.\nDoes the African Lion Make a Good Pet\nNo! Dangerous cats do not belong in the average person\u2019s possession. Lions require extensive knowledge and understanding of animal behavior, lots of time and money, and large fenced areas for habitats.\nAfrican Lion Care\nLions are social animals and must be kept in groups. A pride of lions requires a large amount of space, enclosed by a fence tall enough to prevent climbing or jumping. They must be provided with fresh meat and water, as well as enrichment in the form of training, toys, and other enrichment devices. Enrichment must be given, as the lions are not performing their natural hunting behaviors when in human care.\nBehavior of the African Lion\nLions spend lots of their time resting. They sleep, drowse, take catnaps, and lounge in the sun for a total of twenty hours out of the day! Lions are active during the day, but they tend to hunt more frequently at night. As the sun begins to set, the lions socialize, groom one another, and take care of their bathroom business. They will then spend most of the night alternating between lounging and hunting. Most hunts occur in the hours before sunrise.\nReproduction of the African Lion\nFemale lions will mate with whoever the most dominant male in her group is. She will also mate with any other males in the pride, but the most dominant will reproduce at a higher rate. Like most felines, male lions have a barbed penis that scrapes the female after mating. This frequently results in aggressive behavior from the female. It is believed that the barbed penis can stimulate ovulation when the female is in heat.\nAfter 110 days, the female lion gives birth to 1 \u2013 4 cubs. She will leave the immediate vicinity of the pride, and hide the cubs in tall grasses, caves, or bushes to keep them safe. Most females will not rejoin the pride until the cubs are between 6 and 8 weeks of age. The cubs are weaned at 6 \u2013 7 months old, and the male cubs leave the pride between 2 and 3 years of age.\nBeliefs, Superstitions, and Phobias About the African Lion\nLions are extremely common in folklore, tales, and cultural symbolism. Lions can be commonly seen in biblical references, ancient totems and paintings, god/goddess portrayals, and other art forms. In present times, lions continue to maintain their popularity in books, movies, and television shows."}

Lions are one of the most popular animals among zoologists, and there is no lack of information about their behavior and biology.\nThis article provides interesting facts about lions that may not be common knowledge to many people, so read on!\n1) Male lions are the only cats that grow a mane.\nThey have no other cat in their family to compare it to, so they don\u2019t know that what they have is unusual.\nFor one thing, the mane is a sexually selected characteristic. It\u2019s not randomly chosen as the color of a lion\u2019s fur. Females prefer to mate with males who have a big, impressive mane.\nMales use their manes for two things: intimidation and attraction.\nThe mane makes their heads look more significant and impressive when they roar. What\u2019s interesting is that lions use different roars for different reasons.\n2) A lion\u2019s roar can be heard up to five miles away.\nA lion\u2019s roar can be heard up to five miles away. It is the most powerful sound in nature. Even if they were an athlete or professional singer, the average person would not have the lung capacity to produce such a loud noise.\nThis means that lions are unique animals who possess some superpower we humans don\u2019t know about yet, or maybe it\u2019s just because they\u2019ve got huge lungs!\nLions also have particular muscles in their throat and mouth to help them roar really loud.\n3) Lions are the only cats that live in groups, called pride.\nLions are the only cats that live in groups called pride. A pride usually consists of about fifteen lions but can range in size from two to more than thirty lions.\nA pack is usually led by a single male lion who is the head of the group. He is usually the most significant and most robust lion in the pride. The other lions in the group are either his sons or brothers.\nA Pride provides a sense of security for their members and helps them hunt more efficiently. They can also keep their cubs safe from larger predators, such as tigers and hyenas, that would otherwise prey upon the young lions.\n4) Male lions usually only hunt if there is no food available from the lionesses.\nMale lions usually only hunt if there is no food available from the lionesses.\nHowever, a recent study by University of Copenhagen researchers found that when two male lions are in a group with three or more females, one male will start hunting for prey even when fed by the other males. This means that female lions might actually be the ones who determine how often males need to hunt.\nThe findings also show that these lion groups likely exist because of human interference and not natural selection.\nMale lions were previously thought to form groups based on age and size rather than sex ratios; however, this new study shows otherwise. The number of females present in these groups was shown to affect whether or not males hunted.\n5) Lions can run up to 50 miles per hour.\nLions \u200bcan run up to 50 miles per hour in the wild, meaning they can easily outpace prey (and people).\nThey\u2019re also powerful, capable of taking down animals much more significant than themselves. As apex predators, lions have few enemies in the wild \u2013 a fact that has helped them remain one of the most iconic animals on the planet.\n6) A lion\u2019s tail is used for balance when running.\nLike many other animals, Lions have a tail used for balance when running. It\u2019s not just the long-legged animals that need this extra bit of stability while moving at high speeds. Their backsides are also used for signaling to other members of the pride, including mating.\nLions are the only cats with a tail they use for balance when running. Their tails are also used to signal other pride members, including mating.\nWhen two lions want to show affection towards one another, they will stand side by side, hold their tails up, and intertwine them.\n7) A lion\u2019s diet consists of mostly wildebeest, zebra, and antelope.\nA lion\u2019s diet consists of mostly wildebeest, zebra, and antelope. However, a new study shows that also eat other animals from time to time.\n8) A lion can eat up to 90 pounds of meat at one time.\nThat means that a full-grown lion could devour an entire zebra in one sitting! Lions are known for their powerful jaws and sharp teeth, which allow them to tear through meat with ease.\nLions need to eat so much food because they cannot digest all of the meat, fur, and bones that they eat. As a result, many lions will regurgitate their meals. They also spend about 20 percent of their day eating!\n9) A lioness usually gives birth to a litter of three cubs but litters range from one to six in number.\nThe gestation period of a lioness is about 110 days. Cubs are born blind and helpless and weigh about two pounds. They nurse for about six months but begin to eat meat at three months old. Lionesses usually stay with their cubs until they are about eighteen months old when the young lions start to hunt and fend for themselves.\nLionesses are fiercely protective of their young and remain with them until they are 18 months old.\nHowever, cubs learn to hunt and fend for themselves early. Female lions typically give birth to two or three cubs at a time, but sometimes as many as six.\n10) Male lions are not involved in raising cubs.\nMale lions do not typically participate in the raising of young cubs. However, they will protect their territory and the females and cubs that live there.\nMale lions are not typically involved in the raising of young cubs. They will protect their territory and the females and cubs that live there, but otherwise, they go about their solitary lives.\nMale lions stay in the same territory all of their lives, while females move on to new environments when they get older or more mature.\n11) Lions spend 14 hours a day resting!\nLions spend 14 hours a day resting. This leaves them only six hours for hunting and taking care of their young.\nLions spend most of the day in dense underbrush or hanging out in the hot sun, waiting for the perfect opportunity to pounce on prey.\nWhen it comes down to it, lions are just big, lazy cats \u2026 when they\u2019re not hunting for their next meal, that is! They spend most of the day sleeping in dense underbrush or hanging out in the hot sun.\nLions are nocturnal animals and will usually begin to stir at nightfall. They prefer to hunt after dark because their prey tends to be less alert. Lions can see very well during the night and can even spot their prey from a distance.\n12) Lions have large paws with soft pads on the bottom, which help them to stalk silently while hunting.\nThey can also \u201clock\u201d their claws to keep them from retracting unexpectedly if they accidentally step on something sharp.\nLions have soft pads on the bottom of their paws, which helps them creep up on their prey and large claws that they can lock into place to prevent accidental injury from something sharp.\nTheir paws also have a false heel, giving them more leverage when pulling down on their prey.\n13) There are only seven \u201cbig cat\u201d species globally.\nThere are only seven \u201cbig cat\u201d species in the world: lions, tigers, jaguars, leopards, snow leopards, clouded leopards, and cheetahs.\nCheetahs often get confused with leopards, but they are not related.\n14) Lions do not climb trees well and are not good swimmers.\nLions do not climb trees well and are not very good swimmers. Their large size makes it difficult for them to move through the branches of trees, and they can only swim for short distances.\nLions are much more comfortable on the ground, using their large size to their advantage. However, lions will often seek refuge in a tree when threatened or attacked by other animals in the wild.\n15) Lions can live for 10 to 15 years in the wild and 30 years in captivity.\nLions can live for 10 to 15 years in the wild and 30 years in captivity.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion | San Diego Zoo Animals & Plants", "url": "https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/lion", "text": "Being smaller and lighter than males, lionesses are more agile and faster.\nLions have captured our imagination for centuries. Stars of movies and characters in books, lions are at the top of the food chain. The Swahili word for lion, simba, also means \"king,\" \"strong,\" and \"aggressive.\" The word lion has similar meaning in our vocabulary. If you call someone lionhearted, you\u2019re describing a courageous and brave person. If you lionize someone, you treat that person with great interest or importance.\nPrime habitat for lions is open woodlands, thick grassland, and brush habitat, where there is enough cover for hunting and denning. These areas of grassland habitat also provide food for the herbivores that lions prey upon.\nLions differ from the other members of the large cat genus, Panthera\u2014tigers, leopards, and jaguars. Adult male lions are much larger than females and usually have an impressive mane of hair around the neck. The color, size, and abundance of the mane all vary among individuals and with age. The mane\u2019s function is to make the male look more impressive to females and more intimidating to rival males. The lion\u2019s thick mane also protects his neck against raking claws during fights with other males over territory disputes or breeding rights.\nLions are also the only cats that live in large, social groups called \u201cprides.\u201d A pride can have 3 to 30 lions and is made up of lionesses (mothers, sisters, and cousins), and their cubs, along with a few unrelated adult males. The pride has a close bond and is not likely to accept a stranger. The unrelated males stay a few months or a few years, but the older lionesses stay together for life. In dry areas with less food, prides are smaller, with two lionesses in charge. In habitats with more food and water, prides can have four to six adult lionesses. Both males and females scent mark to define their territory.\nLiving in a pride makes life easier. Hunting as a group means there is a better chance that the lions have food when they need it, and it is less likely that they will get injured while hunting. Lion researchers have noticed that some activities are \u201ccontagious\u201d within a pride. If one lion yawns, grooms itself, or roars, it sets off a wave of yawning, grooming, or roaring!\nLions and lionesses play different roles in the life of the pride. The lionesses work together to hunt and help rear the cubs. This allows them to get the most from their hard work, keeping them healthier and safer. Being smaller and lighter than males, lionesses are more agile and faster. During hunting, smaller females chase the prey toward the center of the hunting group. The larger and heavier lionesses ambush or capture the prey. Lionesses are versatile and can switch hunting jobs depending on which females are hunting that day and what kind of prey it is.\nWhile it may look like the lionesses do all the work in the pride, the males play an important role. While they do eat more than the lionesses and bring in far less food (they hunt less than 10 percent of the time), males patrol, mark, and guard the pride\u2019s territory. Males also guard the cubs while the lionesses are hunting, and they make sure the cubs get enough food. When a new male tries to join a pride, he has to fight the males already there. The new male is either driven off or succeeds in pushing out the existing males.\nA lion\u2019s life is filled with sleeping, napping, and resting. Over the course of 24 hours, lions have short bursts of intense activity, followed by long bouts of lying around that total up to 21 hours! Lions are good climbers and often rest in trees, perhaps to catch a cool breeze or to get away from flies. Lions sometimes lie around in crazy poses, such as on their backs with their feet in the air, or legs spread wide apart!\nLions are famous for their sonorous roar. Males are able to roar when they are about one year old, and females can roar a few months later. Lions use their roar as one form of communication. It identifies individuals, strengthens the pride\u2019s bond, and lets other lions know of the pride\u2019s domain. Other sounds lions produce include growls, snarls, hisses, meows, grunts, and puffs, which sound like a stifled sneeze and is used in friendly situations.\nLions have other forms of communication as well, mostly used to mark territory. They spread their scent by rubbing their muzzle on tufts of grass or shrubs, and they rake the earth with their hind paws, as the paws have scent glands, too. Adult males also spray urine\u2014stand back!\nSaveSave"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "African Lion Facts: Habitat, Diet, Behavior - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/african-lion-facts-4173971", "text": "Throughout history, the African lion (Panthera leo) has represented courage and strength. The cat is easily recognized both by its roar and the male's mane. Lions, which live in groups called prides, are the most social cats. The size of a pride depends on food availability, but a typical group includes three males, a dozen females, and their cubs.\nFast Facts: African Lion Scientific Name: Panthera leo\nCommon Name: Lion\nBasic Animal Group: Mammal\nSize: 4.5-6.5 feet body; 26-40 inch tail\nWeight: 265-420 pounds\nLifespan: 10-14 years\nDiet: Carnivore\nHabitat: Sub-Saharan Africa\nPopulation: 20,000\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nDescription\nThe lion is the only cat exhibiting sexual dimorphism, which means that male and females lions look different from each other. Males are larger than females (lionesses). A lion's body ranges in length from 4.5 to 6.5 feet, with a 26 to 40 inch tail. Weight runs between 265 to 420 pounds.\nLion cubs have dark spots on their coat when they are born, which fade until only faint belly spots remain in adulthood. Adult lions range in color from buff to gray to various shades of brown. Both males and females are powerful, muscular cats with rounded heads and ears. Only adult male lions display a brown, rust, or black mane, which extends down the neck and chest. Only males have dark tail tufts, which conceal tail bone spurs in some specimens.\nWhite lions occur rarely in the wild. The white coat is caused by a double recessive allele. White lions are not albino animals. They have normal-colored skin and eyes.\nThe lion is the only cat with different appearances for males and females. claudialothering / Getty Images\nHabitat and Distribution\nThe lion may be called the \"king of the jungle,\" but it's actually absent from rainforests. Instead, this cat prefers the grassy plains, savannas, and scrubland of sub-Saharan Africa. The Asiatic lion lives in Gir Forest National Park in India, but its habitat only includes the savanna and scrub forest areas.\nDiet\nLions are hypercarnivores, which means their diet consists of more that 70% meat. African lions prefer to hunt large ungulates, including zebra, African buffalo, gemsbok, giraffe, and wildebeest. They avoid very large (elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus) and very small (hare, monkey, hyrax, dik-dik) prey, but will take domestic livestock. A single lion can take down prey twice its size. In prides, lionesses hunt cooperatively, stalking from more than one direction to capture fleeing animals. Lions kill either by strangling their prey or by enclosing its mouth and nostrils to suffocate it. Usually, prey is consumed at the hunting site. Lions often lose their kills to hyenas and sometimes to crocodiles.\nWhile the lion is an apex predator, it falls prey to humans. Cubs are often killed by hyenas, wild dogs, and leopards.\nBehavior\nLions sleep for 16 to 20 hours a day. They most often hunt at dawn or dusk, but can adapt to their prey to change their schedule. They communicate using vocalizations, head rubbing, licking, facial expressions, chemical marking, and visual marking. Lions are known for their fierce roar, but may also growl, meow, snarl, and purr.\nWhen lions and other cats rub heads, they exchange scent markers. Ver\u00f3nica Paradinas Duro / Getty Images\nReproduction and Offspring\nLions are sexually mature at about three years of age, although males tend to be four or five years old before winning a challenge and joining a pride. When a new male takes over a pride, he usually kills the youngest generation of cubs and evicts the adolescents. Lionesses are polyestrous, which means they can mate at any time of year. They go into heat either when their cubs are weaned or when they are all killed.\nAs with other cats, the male lion's penis has backward-pointing spines that stimulate the lioness to ovulate during mating. After a gestation period of about 110 days, the female gives birth to one to four cubs. In some prides, the female gives birth to her cubs in a secluded den and hunts alone until the cubs are six to eight weeks of age. In other prides, one lioness cares for all the cubs while the others go hunting. Females fiercely defend cubs within their pride. Males tolerate their cubs, but don't always defend them.\nAbout 80% of cubs die, but those that survive to adulthood may live to be 10 to 14 years of age. Most adult lions are killed by humans or other lions, although some succumb to injuries sustained while hunting.\nLion cubs are spotted. Image captured by Joanne Hedger / Getty Images\nConservation Status\nThe lion is listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List. The wild population decreased in numbers approximately 43% from 1993 to 2014. The 2014 census estimated about 7500 wild lions remained, but the numbers have continued to decline since that time.\nAlthough lions can tolerate a wide range of habitats, they are threatened because people continue to kill them and because of prey depletion. Humans kill lions to protect livestock, out of fear of human endangerment, and for illegal trade. Prey are threatened by increased commercialization of bushmeat and habitat loss. In some areas, trophy hunting has helped preserve lion populations, while it has contributed to the species' decline in other regions.\nAfrican Lion Versus Asiatic Lion\nMale Asiatic lions have smaller manes than African lions. World of nature / Getty Images\nRecent phylogenetic studies indicate that lions shouldn't really be categorized as \"African\" and \"Asian.\" However, cats living in the two regions do display different appearances and behaviors. From a genetic standpoint, the main difference is that African lions have one infraorbital foramen (hole in the skull for nerves and blood vessels to the eyes), while Asian lions have a bifurcated infraorbital foramen. African lions are larger cats, with thicker and longer manes and shorter tail tufts than Asian lions. An Asiatic lion has a longitudinal fold of skin along its belly that is lacking in African lions. Pride composition differs between the two types of lions, too. This most likely results from the fact that the lions are different sizes and hunt different types of prey.\nLion Hybrids\nLiger (Panthera leo Panthera tigris) in zoo, Siberia, Russia. Denis Ukhov / Getty Images\nLions are closely related to tigers, snow leopards, jaguars, and leopards. They can interbreed with other species to create hybrids cats:\nLiger : Cross between a male lion and a tigress. Ligers are larger than lions or tigers. Male ligers are sterile, but many female ligers are fertile.\n: Cross between a male lion and a tigress. Ligers are larger than lions or tigers. Male ligers are sterile, but many female ligers are fertile. Tigon or Tiglon : Cross between a lioness and a male tiger. Tigons are typically smaller than either parent.\nor : Cross between a lioness and a male tiger. Tigons are typically smaller than either parent. Leopon: Cross between a lioness and a male leopard. The head resembles a lion's, while the body is that of a leopard.\nBecause of the focus on conserving genes from lions, tigers, and leopards, hybridization is discouraged. Hybrids are primarily seen in private menageries.\nSources\nBarnett, R. et al. \"Revealing the maternal demographic history of Panthera leo using ancient DNA and a spatially explicit genealogical analysis\".

Their thundering roars fill us with images of circus performers and prides of feline hunters roaming the plains of Africa. Once endemic to many parts of Europe, India, the Caucasus, and Africa; lions are now limited to fragmented sanctuaries across Africa and one part of India. Because of habitat loss and poaching, they are listed as vulnerable to extinction, and are regionally extinct in many places.\nHere, we\u2019ll learn just what makes a lion\u2019s teeth unique, how many sets they get in a lifetime, and what they use them for. Then, we\u2019ll dive a little deeper into the special uses of each of their four tooth types, and learn just how hard a lion\u2019s bite really is. Finally, we\u2019ll explore why poachers might want to hunt lions for their teeth, and what you can do to help in the conservation of these awe inspiring cats.\nMilk teeth\nLion cubs start their lives drinking exclusively mother\u2019s milk. When they\u2019re about three months old, they start eating small bits of meat. By this time they have all of their deciduous (milk) teeth, and can effectively chew tender bits. At around three months old they begin getting their permanent teeth. By the time they\u2019re 15 months old, they have no baby teeth left, only the adult dentition they will carry for the rest of their lives.\nLions have a lifespan of up to 15 years in the wild. If they make it to this advanced age, their teeth are often so worn down that they must rely on other members of their pride for food. But, lions are social animals, and as long as there is enough food for the pride, old lions can still gum their meat and get by.\nAdult teeth\nLions have 30 teeth; 12 incisors, 4 canines, and 14 carnassials. Audrey Snider-Bell/Shutterstock.com\nLions are obligate, generalist carnivores who occupy both the apex and keystone predator niches of their environment. This means that they hunt and eat meat, a lot of it. Lions are the most diurnal (active in the daytime) of the big cats, and will also eat carrion if they come across it. Since they need their teeth both to hunt, and to eat, they have a few different kinds to do the job.\nLions have a total of 30 teeth; 12 incisors, four canines, ten premolars, and four molars.\nIncisors\nLions have 12 incisors; six on the top, and six on the bottom. In the upper jaw, the corner incisors closest to the canines are bigger than the central and lateral incisors, and there is a gap between them and the canines. Lions use these teeth to grab and pull food, and to scrape meat from bones. They also use them for grooming themselves and other members of their pride.\nCanines\nLions have four massive canine teeth. They use these teeth to grab and hold onto fleeing prey. The canines can grow up to seven centimeters long, and are conical and slightly recurved back towards the skull. They\u2019re not sharp like a house cat\u2019s canines; instead, they\u2019re blunted, and used to clamp onto the nose or windpipe of prey. Lions kill by strangulation or suffocation, and their canine teeth are instrumental in this process.\nCarnassials\nThe premolars and molars of the lion perform the same function; cutting meat. They are known as carnassials; they have high, sharp crowns that occlude against each other on the top and bottom like a pair of scissors. These shearing teeth, coupled with the lion\u2019s ability to open its hinged jaw nearly a foot wide, liken its mouth to a giant double pair of razor sharp scissors.\nWhat Do Lions Use Their Teeth For?\nLions have 30 teeth; 12 incisors, 4 canines, and 14 carnassials Eric Isselee/Shutterstock.com\nLions, like many felines, eat meat and nothing but meat. They don\u2019t eat the hard parts (bones, cartilage) of their prey, and they don\u2019t eat any fruits or vegetables. Because of this, their teeth are streamlined for two specific functions. First, for gripping prey, and second, for cutting up their food.\nHolding On To Prey\nLions use their incisors and canines to attack. Ideally, they bite the animal (zebra and wildebeest are favorite targets) on the throat or nose. Once they\u2019ve dragged the prey to the ground, lions use their formidable canines to close the windpipe, and suffocate the animal to death. Because prey struggle, sometimes kicking or even rolling atop the lion, canine breaks are not uncommon.\nSlicing Meat\nThe second purpose of a lion\u2019s teeth is for carving up meat. Lions don\u2019t really chew; they don\u2019t pulp or crush their food before swallowing. They don\u2019t need to; since they eat meat only, lions need only cut that meat into smaller sections to swallow. Their teeth are so specialized for cutting meat that they actually can\u2019t crush tougher parts like bone or cartilage. Lions are limited to eating the soft parts of the animal, like the flesh and organs.\nHow Hard Is A Lion\u2019s Bite?\nLions are obligate carnivores; they eat meat, and nothing else\nLion jaws are unique among carnivores. They\u2019re short, have few teeth, and can hinge open very wide. Lions also have very strong jaw muscles, coupled with extra large canines. All of this together means that lions have a powerful bite\u2013up to 1,000 PSI. They don\u2019t use all this force to crush bones though; they use it specifically to hold on to and strangle prey.\nPoaching and Teeth\nLions, once common throughout many parts of the world, are now threatened in their native habitats. Most populations are fragmented and relegated to national parks and wildlife refuges, but this doesn\u2019t stop people from poaching them. Lions are often killed in retaliation for dead livestock, or as trophies for wealthy hunters. Additionally, they are illegally killed for their skins, claws, and teeth. Lions are often poached only for these parts, with the poachers harvesting their teeth and claws for illegal trade.\nIt\u2019s important to remember; if you see lion teeth for sale, whether ground up as medicine, or strung as jewelry or art, it\u2019s likely that the teeth came from a poached lion. Avoid buying any parts that come from lions, even if they purport to be legally gained."}

Venturing further from shore, and deeper into the depths than the otters, the seals are the next evolutionary step in our return to the sea.\nThe eared seals, including sea lions and fur seals, have small external ear flaps, powerful forward angled shoulder blades, larger front flippers and more flexible, separated hind flippers than the \"true seals\".\nEared seals spend a great deal of time on land, breeding and sunning on the shores. With long, powerful front flippers, their natural position is upright with the chest raised off the ground.\nTheir rear legs are two separate, front-facing flippers that can be rotated under the body, and they can rise up and move around with a two beat gate. Also often referred to as the \"walking seals\", the eared seals can actually walk, and even run, quite rapidly when necessary.\nThe \"true seals\" have returned even farther back to the ocean. They have no external ear flaps, smaller front flippers and rearward facing hind limbs that are fused together into one scalloped flipper, like a mermaids tail.\nThey move across land by stretching their upper bodies out and arching their backs to pull themselves forward.\nTrue seals also swim differently from eared seals, getting most of their propulsion from their fused, tail-like rear flippers and undulating motions similar to a dolphin to propel themselves, while the eared seals use their strong front flippers as big, highly effective oars, appearing to fly through the water like birds.\nWalruses have skeletons designed more like the eared seals, but have no ears. They move like the true seals in the water, but like the eared seals on land, and so are somewhere in between these two groups, and are classified in a genus of their own. - Ocean Animals Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion Facts: Habitat | Lion Landscapes", "url": "https://www.lionlandscapes.org/lion-habitat", "text": "Lion habitat -from savannah to desert\nFrom savannah to desert\nLions can live almost anywhere, having been recorded in open grasslands, woodlands, thick bush, and thick, scrubby areas. Overall, lions have a relatively broad habitat tolerance, being historically absent only from tropical rainforests and very arid deserts (although some desert-adapted lions manage to persist in areas of Namibia, using the little water and prey available along waterways). Lions can even be found on beaches (especially in Saadani National Park, Tanzania, and on the Skeleton Coast in Namibia) and on mountain ridges, provided sufficient prey is available!\nHabitat requirement 1: Prey availability\nThe most important habitat requirement for lions is the availability of suitable prey. Lions can consume a great variety of prey species; however, their size and social habits are particularly well adapted to predation on larger herbivores, such as buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe, and zebra. Healthy populations of these species are ideal for lions to thrive, and reach their greatest numbers. Nevertheless, lions are highly adaptable in their hunting strategies, and can do well also in areas dominated by smaller prey, such as impala or warthog.\nHabitat requirement 2: Cover\nIn addition to prey, lions also need cover, in the form of long grass, bushes, or trees, to be able to stalk prey and capture it. In fact, studies have shown that lions often select for areas with higher prey \u2018catchability\u2019, rather than necessarily availability. Food is not much use, if you can\u2019t catch it! Lions therefore thrive in habitats which are sufficiently covered to allow for stalking, and open enough that they can then give chase effectively once they get close enough.\nHabitat requirement 3: Water\nLions also require water; while they do not need to drink every day, obtaining moisture they from prey, they do require water relatively regularly. This leads lion prides to often hang around the few remaining sources of water in their home range during the dry season - as prey also needs to come to these to drink, they can often access both food and water without having to move much at all! As areas around rivers also often provide good stalking cover, these are particularly frequently used by lions.\nHabitat requirement 4: Shade\nFinally, as most people who have seen lions in the wild will tell you - lions sleep a lot during the day! As a result, they will always seek shade in the hottest hours of the day, which can take the form of trees, bushes, or rocks - and even cars!\nLion Landscapes - where large carnivores and people can thrive"}

Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious sexual dimorphism, meaning that males and females look distinctly different.\nLeonine imagery is everywhere. For Pete's sake, we've got lions guarding the New York Public Library, heralding new MGM movies and adorning the helmets of Detroit's National Football League franchise. Since the days of Aesop, the beasts have symbolized power and might. But don't forget that real lions aren't storybook archetypes. They're living, breathing animals \u2014 and fairly strange ones, at that. Here are five things you probably didn't know about the much-mythologized felines.\nAdvertisement\n1. When They Attack Porcupines, Things Get Ugly\nIt's hard to make a meal out of something that's covered in 19.7-inch (50-centimeter) flesh-piercing spikes. African lions live side by side with porcupines in the Hystrix genus. At most, these rodents weigh just 66 pounds (30 kilograms ) or so \u2014 yet they're more than capable of holding their own against the so-called \"king of the beasts.\"\nPorcupines have soft bellies, but their backs and flanks are adorned with detachable quills and spines. Predators risk serious injury by attacking the well-armed critters. Still, when times are tough, carnivores may decide the risk is worth the reward.\nA 2019 review found about 50 documented instances of lions getting wounded or killed by porcupine spikes. It was also revealed that lions who live in arid places \u2014 where large herbivores are scarce \u2014 tend to hunt porcupines more often.\nAn unsuccessful attack can leave the cats with empty bellies and quill-riddled faces. Such injuries cause serious problems down the road. If a spike gets lodged in a lion's jaws, teeth or nose, its hunting skills might suffer. So lions who've gotten stabbed by porcupines become more likely to go after \"easy prey\" like domestic cattle \u2014 and human beings.\nAdvertisement\n2. Some Lions Hunt Giraffes \u2014 By Using Asphalt Roads\nThere's strength in numbers. Late in the dry season (i.e., August through November), the Savuti lions of Botswana have to contend with food shortages \u2014 because that's when various hoofed mammals migrate out of the area. In response, the cats gang up on full-grown elephants, frequently under the cover of darkness. Up to 30 lions join forces to isolate one of the gray juggernauts from the rest of its herd. With a flurry of bites to the back, legs and tail, the predators eventually wear their target down. Game over.\nOf course, elephants aren't the continent's only giants. Over at South Africa's Kruger National Park, lions have started driving giraffes onto asphalt-paved roadways. The smooth driving surfaces don't provide much traction, so giraffes are prone to slip while crossing them. And once an animal's down, it's easier to slaughter.\nAdvertisement\n3. Darker Manes Are More Attractive to Females\nLionesses like their mates dark and handsome. Many naturalists used to think male lions grew manes because they helped protect the neck area. Supposedly, all that extra hair could cushion blows during fights with rivals. But this idea fell by the wayside in 2002 after a series of experiments involving realistic lion dummies.\nA team led by biologist Peyton West exposed four phony lions to real-life males and females in Serengeti National Park. The lionesses made their preference clear. In 13 out of 14 trials, females responded more positively to dark-maned dummies than they did to the ones with light, dirty blonde manes. On the other hand, visiting males seemed intimidated by the dark-haired props.\nWhat accounts for this behavior? Dark hair does a better job of retaining heat. At first, you might think this would become a huge liability in hot places like the Serengeti. But according to West, darker manes send a useful message. Males who can grow those things are healthy enough to withstand the extra heat they entrap. Ergo, the dark manes advertise physical fitness. That both attracts females and makes other males think twice about picking a fight.\nAdvertisement\n4. Those Tufted Tails Are Communication Tools\nUniquely among the world's cats, lions have tassels of thick black hair on the ends of their tails. Cubs start developing these five and a half months after birth. And as they grow, the youngsters may entertain themselves by grabbing hold of an adult cat's tail tuft. (Visualize your pet kitty playing with a feather toy.) Mature lions use their tails \u2014 tassels and all \u2014 to express themselves. During fights, the tail is kept rigidly straight and it waves vertically when a threat is near. Females tend to flick their tail tufts around while cubs are present: This might help the infants keep track of their mothers in tall grasses.\nAdvertisement\n5. Wild Lions Are Not Limited To Africa\nThousands of years ago, lions stalked northern Africa, southwestern Asia, the Middle East and portions of Europe. (Reportedly, one pride harassed Persian invaders during a military campaign through Greece in the year 480 B.C.E.) Since then, their range has dwindled considerably. But today, we still have a living reminder of an age when these dreaded cats patrolled three continents.\nStep right up and meet the Asiatic lion. Found exclusively in northwestern India, this animal is essentially a holdover: While lions were dying out in Greece, Iran and elsewhere, a small population staved off extinction in the Indian state of Gujurat. Compared to their African brethren, Asiatic lions have bigger tail tufts and thinner manes which leave the ears exposed. In terms of overall body size, these Indian felines are roughly 10 to 20 percent smaller.\nConservationists have every right to be concerned about both varieties. Between 1994 and 2015, the number of wild lions in Africa dropped by 43 percent. Currently there are only around 20,000 of these cats left on the continent. Meanwhile, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the Asiatic lion as endangered \u2014 but there are some positive signs. A 2017 field survey counted about 650 individuals living in their natural habitat. That's a step up from an earlier 2015 census, which only documented 523 wild lions.\nNow That's Interesting With an estimated weight of over 771 pounds (350 kilograms), the prehistoric \"American lion\" (Panthera atrox) was one of the biggest cats that ever lived. However, despite its common name, paleontologists now think the creatures were more closely related to tigers and jaguars than actual lions."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "22 Interesting Facts about Mountain Lions - FactsKing.com", "url": "https://factsking.com/animal-facts/mountain-lion-facts/", "text": "Welcome to this article about the mountain lion! Also known as the cougar or puma, this animal is one of the largest wild cats in North America. These creatures are quite elusive and rarely seen in the environment. Join us as we take a look at some of the interesting facts behind the mountain lion!\nMountain Lion Scientific and Physical Characteristics\nThe scientific name for the mountain lion is Puma concolor. They are also known as puma, cougar, catamount or panther. It is considered the largest species of wild cat in North America and second heaviest after the Jaguar. Although they are of a larger size, they share a closer resemblance to the smaller felines in terms of physical features and are therefore not considered to be part of the big cat family. There are 32 subspecies of mountain lions including the North American cougar, Argentine cougar, and Southern South American cougar. A mountain lion has a round head with erect ears, powerful jaws, and retractable claws. They are the fourth largest wild cat species in the world, standing up to 90 cm tall and having a length of around 8 ft. Males tend to weigh around 180 lbs while females weigh around 110 pounds. Despite their size, they are incredibly agile and slender creatures. Compared to big cats, mountain lions do not usually \u2018roar\u2019. They have minimal communicative noises, usually resorting to hisses, growls, and purrs which give them more similarity to a house cat. They have a general tawny coat (similar to that of a lion, hence the name). The infants are normally spotted with rings on the tail, whereas the juveniles will also have dark spots on certain regions. Their front limbs tend to have large paws and long hind legs. This enables them to be excellent jumpers, often leaping up to heights of around 20 feet. The long legs allow them to sprint rapidly up to 50 mph.\nHabitat and Distribution of Mountain Lion\nThe mountain lion has one of the largest distributions of wild animals in the Americas. Their range spans from the Northernmost areas of Canada to the Southern tips of the Andes mountains. This distribution is due to its high versatility and adaptability towards any habitat type. It can be found from forests to deserts, although it shows a preference towards areas with lots of canyons, mountainous regions, and dense bushes. They can survive in areas with very little vegetation as well. Like most species of the cat family, the mountain lion is mostly solitary. Mothers will live with the kittens until they grow up while other adults will be met with on rare occasions. However, they can share their kills with other adults. Their home ranges can be large in size but vary for the most part. Territories are marked by scratch marks on trees, urine, and fecal marking. They can be territorial animals and males will often compete with each other for territory.\nFacts about Mountain Lion\u2019s Diet and Behavior\nA mountain lion is a general predator and a carnivore so it can eat any animal it catches, whether it is an insect or a large ungulate. They are capable of hunting large species of deer, elk, and moose. The body mass of the prey that is consumed by the mountain lion usually varies. In regions closer towards the equator, they will hunt and feed on prey that is of a lower mass. Mountain lions typically hunt their prey by ambushing them rather than sprinting or chasing after. With its strong limbs, it usually waits until the prey comes near before jumping on to it and killing it via a powerful neck bite. The jaws are incredibly powerful so they can easily crush the prey\u2019s windpipe or even snap the neck. A single adult can survive on one large prey for around two weeks. It can save the carcass by hiding it and coming to feed on it over a few days. Females usually have one litter every 2 years or so. The litter can be between one to six cubs. Only the mothers are involved with raising their young and the juveniles will remain with their mother for at least two years before surviving on their own. Mountain lions are abundant in terms of the population but encounter with humans very rarely. The mountain lion populations carry only a small threat and are not endangered as of yet. However, they have been hunted due to their interference with livestock and are also treated by deforestation, habitat loss and poaching.\nI hope that you learned from reading this article on mountain lion facts.

Lions sleep for as many as 20 hours a day, so don\u2019t be surprised if you find them resting!\nFascinating Facts\nHunting takes place mostly at night, and digesting large amounts of meat protein involves effort, so lions often spend as many as 20 hours a day resting.\nAt a kill, male lions eat first, then females, then the cubs eat last.\nLions are primarily terrestrial but will occasionally climb trees to rest, avoid other animals or even steal a kill from a leopard.\nPhysical Characteristics\nMale lions weigh between 330 and 550 pounds, while female lions weigh from 265 to 395 pounds. Their head to body length ranges from 4.6 to 6.3 feet with a tail length around 3 feet. A lion coat is light tawny yellow or buff with a white belly. The male has a mane that varies in color from light tawny to dark brown to black and acts as protection during a fight. Lions\u2019 coloration provides excellent camouflage in grassy plains and scrub country.\nLions have 9 distinct vocalizations. The roar can be heard at a distance of 5 miles and is usually heard at sundown, after a kill and after eating. The remaining sounds have not been interpreted, but appear to having meaning within the pride.\nHabitat/Diet\nAfrican lions currently range in east, south and central Africa in grassy plains, savannas, open woodlands and scrub country. Their historic range was much wider. A very small Asian population still exists in India\u2019s Gir Forest.\nIn the wild, lions eat wildebeests, zebras, buffalo, gazelles, wart hogs and other ungulates that may overlap its territory. If large game is scarce, they will eat small game, carrion and even domestic livestock. At the Zoo, the lions are fed a diet of fortified horsemeat, chicken and rabbits.\nSocial Behavior\nIn the wild, lions are very social animals. The lion is the only big cat that lives in a group, or pride, which may number from 5 to 35 members.\nFemale lions do most of the hunting, while the primary role of the males is breeding and protection of the pride.\nFemales breed every other year but, if a litter is lost, she may breed again within a few days. A litter of 1 to 4 cubs is born after a gestation period of about 110 days. Cubs have rosette markings that fade as they mature. A female cub may remain with the pride for her entire life, but males are driven off by the time they are 3. These males often form bachelor groups until they can take over a pride of their own. Cubs have a high mortality rate and less than half survive their first year due to injury, lack of food, illness and infanticide.\nStatus In The Wild\nIn late 2015, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service added lions to the Endangered Species Act. The lion is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN but its population is rapidly declining due to loss of habitat, sport hunting and poisoning to protect livestock interests. Human settlement is a major factor contributing to habitat loss and depletion of wild prey. Fortunately, lions are present in a number of protected parks where their numbers can be closely monitored. Additionally, these magnificent cats are vital to local eco-tourism which provides incentive to support lion conservation.\nThe San Francisco Zoo participates in AZA\u2019s Species Survival Plan (SSP) for African lions and has had a successful breeding program for African lions for decades."}

They were not even fighting. It brought some curiosity in my life so I researched. You are lucky to read all that information in this article because a burst of knowledge is waiting for you!\nWhat is a male lion called? A male lion is called a lion and the female lion is called a lioness. While a baby lion is called a cub. Lions are extremely social and they even allow other male lions to live with them. Lions live in groups that have their cubs in it which is called a pride.\nThroughout the history of mankind, there are very few animals that are respected and revered by humans like the lion. The animal is so renowned that it has become a cultural symbol of bravery, power and royalty.\nMale Lion Facts\nIf we talk about looks, lions are extremely muscular and deep-chested big cats with a unique patternless light brown/golden fur. There is significant sexual dimorphism in this species that makes them distinctive based on gender. Let\u2019s check some more facts below \u2013\nMales are larger and stronger and have a distinctive mane that set them apart while the females are smaller and faster with a more streamlined body that makes it easier for them to hunt. Speaking of which, the males rarely hunt prey at all.\nA group of lions is known as pride and this pride has a patriarchal structure where the females are the primary hunters with running speeds of up to 81 km/h while.\nThe male lions only serve to protect the territory and mate with the females.\nMale cubs aren\u2019t killed by their own father, only exiled. However, any stray males in search of pride that comes across a rival male\u2019s cubs will ruthlessly kill them and will also attempt to kill the pride\u2019s main male or at least exile him, in order to claim the pride as their own, but the females in heat, mate with them to make their own bloodlines grow.\nDuring droughts and times of extreme shortage of water and food(namely prey) lions and lioness may invade the territories of other pride.\nIn the hostile environment of the wild savannahs and grasslands of Africa, lions have an average lifespan of 15 years and in captivity, some have managed to reach 25+ years.\nA lion\u2019s roar can be heard up to 8 km or 5 miles away.\nNames of Famous Male Lions\nThroughout time and history and especially in the media, there have been some prominent lions with unique names that are remembered for either good or tragic reasons. Here is a list of some famous lions that includes both real and fictional lions.\nCecil\nCecil was a star attraction of Zimbabwe\u2019s Hwange national park that was tragically hunted down by Walter Palmer, an American dentist turned recreational hunter that killed the elegant Cecil. What made the event more tragic was the fact that Walter Palmer was such a bad shot that he only managed to fatally wound Cecil and later died after 12 hours of sheer agony. But in a fit of karma, this case picked up media attention and Walter Palmer gained notoriety worldwide. Though Walter faced no legal consequences, his reputation and business were tarnished beyond repair forever.\nSizanani\nNicknamed \u2018phantom\u2019, Sizanani was an amazing lion that lived in the Manyeleti Game Reserve. Sizanani got this nickname for his disappearance acts that lasted so long everyone would believe he died, including the park rangers. However, he would also return just as amazing as he disappeared, to baffle everyone. Sizanani was an amazing survivor as well, one of the last survivors of the Oklahoma pride, a pride whose males including Sizanani\u2019s father and other cubs were brutally slaughtered by the legendary Mapogo coalitions of lions. Sizanani and his brother had amazing wildlife full of danger, loss and triumph.\nLeo\nLeo is the main animal mascot for MGM, a prominent Hollywood film studio during the 1950s. His clips have been used in the start and end of many films, television shows and commercials by the studio and there is a good chance even you have seen his clip.\nTsavo Maneaters/Njombe man-eaters\nThese lions caused fear and panic throughout the world in the late 19th and early 20th century as these lions were amongst the first photographed man-eater lions in history. Unlike Cecil, these lions possessed such a threat that they had to be hunted down by real hunters. Not those recreational wannabe\u2019s.\nNemean Lion\nPerhaps the most famous mythical lion of all mythology, the Nemean lion was a power nearly invulnerable monster, that was impervious to man-made weapons like blades and arrows of the time and took a demigod like Hercules to be taken down.\nHonorable Mentions\nLions like Simba from the lion king and Aslan from the chronicles of Narnia are also some of the most famous lions with high popularity thanks to books and movies, but because of their fictional nature, they couldn\u2019t make it to this list.\nName Of a Male Sea Lion\nWell, it entirely depends on where and in what situation the sea lions are. For instance, their group on land is called a Colony. When they are in the water then you refer to them as Raft. Besides, when many females are in the territory of a single male then it\u2019s called Harem, whereas when it\u2019s a mating season, then it is called Rookery. Seems interesting, right?\nSea lions are also called pinnipeds and they are a species of seals that share the name \u2018lion\u2019 with actual lions due to a similar carnivorous nature and dominance in nature on their respective food chains.\nWhat is The Male Lion Job\nThe male lions have only 3 main roles to play:\nGet dibs on whatever the females manage to hunt down and take the first bites aggressively.\nMate with all the females.\nProtect and watch their territory, getting rid of other threats and males including their own sons, to ensure there is no challenge to their role or threat to the pride at all. However, there have been large pride that had up to 3 males with one being the main patriarch.\nDominant Male Lion Called\nThe dominant male in pride is called \u2018the king of the pride\u2019 or the pride male. This male usually also has a large mane that serves as his crown and a show of his dominance across the pride.\nA lion is an apex predator in the jungles of Africa, a king of the wild feared and respected by all in it\u2019s the kingdom of wild.\nMale Lion Hair Called\nThe magnificent hair on a male lion\u2019s back and neck region is called a mane. It serves to both intimidate other threats to the lion and as armor to its skin from attacks of other animals.\nSome people confuse whether that\u2019s hair or fur on the neck of a lion but the truth is that it is fur.\nHowever, you would not be less surprised to know that male lions use their mane to be friends with female lions. How intelligent!\nAfrican Male Lion Names\nSome of the popular names given to lions in Africa include Kenya, Sahara, Kalahari, Namib, Namibia, Jira, Kamili, Sudan, Kazi, Zahara, Kodjo, Armani, Zambia and Simba.\nYou can call lions the celebrities of animals. This is why they are given a bunch of importance across the globe and obviously people name them according to their tastes, that is a reason why lions have so many names in several languages.\nMale Mountain Lion Name\nThe mountain lion can also be called the Puma, panther, cougar and catamount. One adult male is also called Tom.\nThese lions are huge. Once a mountain lion is done with hunting, it drags it to the bushes to use it in the future. Although, summers don\u2019t favor this habit and so he has to prey more because the prey they saved for the future is rotten with time.\nAlpha Male Lion\nAs much as we like the concept of an Alpha Male in just about every den or group, there is such a thing as an Alpha male lion, in both pride or coalitions, if there are more than 1 males in pride or if there is a coalition, the authority is shared between them. However, you should consider the fact that there is no such thing as an alpha lion.\nIf you find a head lion in a jungle, don\u2019t call it an alpha lion but a pride male. That will suit the demand of the situation.\nWhat Is a Lone Male Lion Called\nThere is no such specific term for a lone lion but that\u2019s for sure that lone lions are nomadic, which means they travel and wander a lot from one area to the other and that is probably because they don\u2019t have much of a responsibility on them, haha!\nThe scientific name is Panthera Leo for a male lion, and it belongs to the family of Felidae. Other names for this family that is well known is the family of big cats.\nA lion is so famous for being the king of the jungle that not just in the English language but also in other languages, it has given different names. You can buy stories about lions from here.\nWhat Is a Young Male Lion Called\nYoung male lions and lionesses are called cubs. This name is gender-neutral and applies to both females and males.\nCubs reach the peak of adorableness alongside being innocent but sometimes male lions kill even others\u2019 cubs to ensure that the cubs don\u2019t take their \u201cking chair\u201d now or then. I know that\u2019s sad but that\u2019s how nature works sometimes. Alas!\nWhat Is a Lions Home Called\nThe term used to describe a lion\u2019s home is called \u2018den\u2019. These are usually cave-like or a rocky area with lots of covers where the pride can live in peace and with security. However, lions can also live under the shade of trees in the savannah when such areas are not accessible to them. As the word den depends on the presence of lions, in such cases, these areas are also classified as dens.\nWhat Is a Male Lion Called In Pride\nThe word lion is in itself the main name for male lions, while lioness is used to describe female lions. An alternative name native to Africa for male lions is \u2018Simba\u2019. This name has also been used in media and movies by companies like Disney to depict a key lion character like \u2018Simba\u2019, the lion king, son of Mufasa and the main protagonist of \u2018The Lion King\u2019 movies. A group of lions or pride that has only males is called a \u2018coalition\u2019.\nRelated Articles: How long are rabbits pregnant?\nFinal Verdict\nHopefully, now you know what is a male lion called and other important infos about male lions. Lions are the fantastic and majestic species of big cats, one that is more social and collectively they are dangerous than other big cats. They are not as fast as cheetahs, stealthy as panthers, or strong as tigers, but unlike the other big cats, they are social, they make pride and coalitions. They are the toughest of the big cats thanks to their manes, the most coordinated and the loudest. Because these features deserve their high ranks as apex predators and should be both respected and feared."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion Pride: The Social Organization of Lions - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-lion-pride-130300", "text": "The lion (Panthera leo) has a number of characteristics that differentiate it from the other wild predatory cats of the world. One of the key differences is its social behavior. While some lions are nomadic and prefer to travel and hunt individually or in pairs, most lions live in a social organization known as a pride. It's a trait that's quite unique among the world's large cat species, most of which are lone hunters throughout their adult lives.\nThe Organization of a Pride\nThe size of a lion pride can vary widely, and the structure differs between African and Asian subspecies. On average, a lion pride consists of about two or three males and 5-10 females, along with their young.\ufeff\ufeff Prides with as many as 40 animals have been observed.\ufeff\ufeff In the rarer Asian subspecies, however, lions divide themselves into gender-specific prides in which males and females remain in separate groups except for mating time.\nIn the typical African pride, the females form the core of the group and tend to remain in the same pride from birth until death\u2014although females are occasionally expelled from the pride. As a result of remaining in the same pride throughout their lifetimes, female lions are generally related to one another. Due to this permanence, lion prides are considered to be matriarchal in their social structure.\nThe Role of Male Lions\nMale cubs remain in a pride for about three years, after which they become wandering nomads for about two years until they either take over an existing pride or form a new one around the age of five.\ufeff\ufeff\nSome male lions remain nomads for life. These long-term nomadic males rarely reproduce, since most fertile females in a pride are protected from outsiders by its members. On rare occasions, a group of new male lions, usually young nomads, may take over an existing pride; during this kind of takeover, the intruders may try to kill the offspring of other males.\nBecause the life expectancy for male lions is considerably less than that of females, their tenure within a pride is relatively short. Males are in their prime from about ages five to 10. Once they are no longer capable of fathering cubs, they're usually expelled from the pride. Males rarely remain part of the pride for more than three to five years. A pride with older males is ripe for takeover by groups of young nomad males.\nWn Xin / EyeEm / Getty Images\nPride Behavior\nCubs in a given pride are often born near the same time, with the females serving as communal parents. The females suckle one another's young; however, weaker offspring are routinely left to fend for themselves and often die as a result.\nLions usually hunt with other members of their pride. Some experts theorize that it's the hunting advantage a pride offers in the open plains that may have led to the evolution of the pride social structure.\ufeff\ufeff Such hunting areas are populated by large prey animals, some of which can weigh as much as 2,200 pounds\u2014making hunting in groups a necessity (nomadic lions are more likely to feed on small prey weighing less than 220 pounds).\ufeff\ufeff\nA lion pride spends a good deal of time in idleness and sleep, with males patrolling the perimeter to guard against intruders. Within the pride structure, females lead the hunt for prey. The pride gathers to feast after the kill, squabbling amongst themselves.\nWhile they do not lead the hunt in a pride attack, nomadic male lions are very skilled hunters since they're often forced to hunt small, very swift game. Whether in groups or alone, the lion hunting strategy is generally slow, patient stalking followed by short bursts of speed to attack. Lions do not have great stamina and do not do well in long pursuits."}

Mane: There is no sure answer as to the question why lions have manes. Some people believe the mane acts as protection against other lions bighting the neck in fights, but lions often fight by biting on the back. One other possibility is that the mane is there to attract the female lions. Charles Darwin was the first to suggest that the mane may be a result of \"sexual selection\" meaning that the mane may play a role in reproductive selection.\nGeographical Range and Habitat Prides of lions are highly territorial and often occupy the same area for many years. Territory size depends on features such as prey availibility, permanent water sources and suitable places for hiding young cubs. Males will defend their territory and prides from rival males. The size of a prides territory can be huge but the defended territory of the moment is the size that a lion scents it. A male lion will spray a special scent on bushes, high grass etc on the boundaries of their territory to warn off nomad male lion/lions and also to warn off other prides. Female lions do spray but only occasionally. A male lion will also put paw marks in the soil to ward off unwanted guests in the territory. A female and male lion will begin marking and scenting at about the age of two.\nSocial System Lions in prides share a strong social bond reinforced by behaviors such as head-rubbing and social grooming. While females direct most of their attention to other females and cubs, male lions are most attentive to each other. Males do this because males only spend two years with a pride, but remain bonded with their male companions throughout their lives. Males and females will touch one another when lying down to show affection to one another and greeting. The lions rub so hard on one another that one of the lions usually end up falling on top of the other lion. Males will strut in front of females to show their dominance.\nDiet The lion is a carnivore, and feed mainly on large herd animals so the whole pride will be able to feed. A lions diet mainly consists of: Zebra Buffalo Wildebeest Wild Hogs Antelope impala giraffe (if the adult giraffe has fallen or a baby giraffe) A lion will sometimes eat till their bellies look like it will explode, the amount of food is about 66 pounds (30 kg), they do this because the lion may not catch any prey to eat for up to five days. This is why the lion will sleep or just laze around for around twenty hours a day and only move around or hunt for about four hours. Lions do not really like to share their food and often fight for places at a kill with prime males taking the proverbial \"lion's share\", up to 25% of their weight. The lion is also a scavenger and will eat the dead carcass of an animal. They can sometimes tell where a dead carcass is by the circling of vultures or vultures milling around on the ground. The lion has a sense of when an animal is dying or sick also and will attack the dying animal. A lion will also steal food from the hyena, one group of people say the lion is the better hunter and another group say the hyena is the better hunter. All in all, the lion and hyena are both exceptional hunters and both steal food from each other.\nForaging / Predatory Behaviour Although the females do most of the hunting, when the male lion hunts, he usually only hunts for himself when no free lunch is provided by the lionesses or other means. The male is not a great hunter, mainly because of his bulk and the largeness of his mane. Hunting is usually done by the female in the early evening and early morning although if prey is abundant during the day the female/male lion will hunt. The female lion captures most of the prey although the male, with its giant size will catch the more larger prey (buffalo etc). Even though the female is usually the hunter, the male lion will usually eat first, usually with the cubs and the females come to the dead animal later. Male/female lions will travel for kilometers to find food. With the lions sleek and flexible body, it is able to hide among the long grass of the wild while the lion stalks his prey. The lions golden/brown colouring is also helpful by blending in with the tall grass and surroundings, with these two traits the lion is able to sneak up very close to its prey before sprinting after the animal. It is plausible that lions are the only sociable cats because a single lion has only 17% to 19% of catching prey, while a group of lions has around 30% chance. This is possible so that lions could share food with relatives and also protect their food from competitors, including other lions, as the old saying go's 'strength in numbers'. When a lion is threatening another animal, including prey, danger or another lion , the lion will: Keep its head low\nForelegs wide apart\nShoulders higher than normal\nGazes at opponent with their eyes and mouth (if the lion is snarling during this, it means the lion is more on the defense)\nEars twisted so that their black marks face forward When a lion lashes its tail up and down during any threatening display and the lion growls or coughs, this shows a charge is imminent.\nMale Coalitions Male coalitions are usually related males that has left their pride as adolescents and stayed together as nomads until they are mature and ready to compete.A lone nomad may join other lone nomads to form a coalition as formable as sibling coalitions. Once a coalition has taken over a pride, after an enduring battle with the prides origional lion/coalition, the victors usually have only two years before losing in turn to a younger and stronger or larger coalition. The larger the coalition of lions the better, as a coalition of 4 to 6 lions may last up to four years. Coalitions of four or more lions in a pride are very rare.\nReproduction / Life Span Male lions start breeding at around the age of five. Once a male lion or a coalition of male lions have taken over a pride the new male lions will kill all the suckling cubs of their rivals to start the lioness coming into heat. The lioness will come into heat every couple of weeks for 4 to 5 months without becoming pregenant, this occurs to try and stop desertion of the females and to help the new lion/lions to bond with their new pride., so that the new male lion/lions of the pride can start propagating their genes with the lionesses. When the sterility period ends, pride females ovulate, conceive, and litter in synchrony. The cubs are then reared communally, improving the chances that a sizable male coalition will eventually propagate their parents genes. Male lions that are within the same pride do not compete with each other over mating rights with females. The first male to encounter a female on heat has dominance over her, until the mating is finished or until the male is tired of mating. The prime years for a male lion are 5 to 9, at 8 years old they are already losing weight and mane hair and few survive past 10 years old.\nFatherhood While mothers bear the brunt of caring for the cubs, fathers also make important contributions. The males protect the females and cubs from strange lions and also catch large prey from which the whole pride can feed. When cubs are small, males generally remain at a distance from the pride but older cubs are fascinated by their fathers, often approaching them and trying to play. This often results in either the lion telling the cub to go away or if the cub is lucky and the lion is in a good mood, the male will play while teaching the cub fighting skills in the process. A lion will most often have first bite at any new kill that is available (either killed by the lionesses or natural causes) and the lionesses will wait for their turn. The cubs are the only ones allowed to feast with their fathers."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion - Facts, Diet, Habitat & Pictures on Animalia.bio", "url": "https://animalia.bio/public/african-lion", "text": "Habits and Lifestyle\nLions can be active at any time of the day but their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing and grooming. Most hunting often takes place at dusk. Apart from that African lions spend much of their time resting. They rest in order to save energy, in the absence of prey, or to escape the midday heat. African lions are highly social animals, gathering in groups or prides, which include up to 3 male lions and multiple lionesses with their young. Prides are defended by males, who patrol and mark the territory. However, there's harsh competition between males for the territory and position in the pride. In a case, if another male overcomes the leading male of the pride, he usually kills all cubs, sired by the previous male. Meanwhile, males do not tend to hunt due to their slow speed and eye-catching appearance. Instead, hunting is left to females of the pride, who hunt in groups, cooperating with each other during their hunting trips. The females are excellent hunters: they are faster and more agile than males, able to hunt down animals that are much bigger and faster than them."}

A mature Siberian tiger can top out at 11 feet long and close to 700 pounds.\nTigers once inhabited most of Asia, from the tropical islands to Siberia. Today they are restricted to small patches of territory and very limited populations of each of the 6 living subspecies.\nThe largest of the tigers, the Siberian or Amur tiger, lives in the coniferous forests of Russia where its thick fur and full neck ruff keep it warm in deep snow.\nIn contrast, the much smaller Sumatran tiger lives in thick southern jungles and regularly bathes in ponds or streams to keep cool.\nThe Bengal tiger is the most common of the subspecies. They are almost as large as Siberians with top weights in the 500 pound range. Bengal tigers live in India, Bangladesh and Nepal in semi-tropical jungles.\nThe tiger is a stalk and ambush style hunter, and it's familiar stripes provide camouflage in thick underbrush as it waits for prey as large as 1000 pound water buffalo.\nThey have the largest fangs in the animal world and are very swift killers. The tiger is basically a solitary animal with a typical feline lifestyle. They roam wide and have very large overlapping territories but conflict and aggression between individuals is rare, and amazingly, wild tigers have been known to share their kill with other individuals, not always family members, who may happen upon them feeding.\nThis fascinating behavior, so different from the highly food-aggressive African lion, has been well documented.\nThe tiger, (and particularly the Bengal due to its proximity to civilization) is responsible for more human deaths then any other cat, hence the common term \"man-eating tiger\".\nA symbol of conservation efforts, the tiger is critically endangered throughout much of its range, but many of its small, pocket populations have remained stable for years due to government crackdowns on poaching. - Tiger Facts\ntiger, tiger\nBengal tigers\nAs the third largest carnivore on land, the tiger is smaller only than the polar bear and the brown bear.\nBut Bengal tigers in particular eat some of the largest prey, including gaur antelope, sambar deer, and massive water buffalo over 1200 pounds.\nTigers have been known to kill and eat sloth bears and Asian black bears, baby rhinos and even leopards. There have been isolated incidents reported of Bengal tigers taking down young elephants and even full grown infirmed adults.\nSiberian tigers - the largest of the tiger subspecies - actually prey on smaller game than the Bengal, with deer and mountain goats being their most common fare.\nThe Bengal is also the most likely tiger to kill human beings because its range has been so severely impacted by advancing development.\nMost wild tiger subspecies do not intermingle, because their populations are separated by wide swaths of civilization, but captive individuals in zoos, preserves and private possession have been housed together, and have inter-bred for decades and are not usually pure representatives of any one subspecies.\nMore often than not they are of mixed heritage, out crossed between the subspecies for so many generations of captivity that they are effectively \"mutts\". .\ngorgeous tigers\ntiger reproduction\nmother tigress and cubs\nMale and female tigers will pair up when the female is in estrus. After mating numerous times over the course of 4 or 5 days the male will return to a basically solitary life.\nThe female tigers pregnancy is 3 1/2 to 4 months long. In the last few days of pregnancy, the tigress will secure a safe nesting place because where she will deliver her 3 to 5 cubs.\nThe newborn tiger cubs weigh only about 2 pounds, are blind, completely helpless, and fully striped. The mother only stays in the same nest for a day or two and moves her cubs from hiding place to hiding place one at a time for the first few months of their lives.\nThis is a very dangerous time for the cubs, as she must leave them alone while she hunts. Often entire litters are lost when they are discovered by bears, leopards or snakes.\nFathers do not take part in the rearing of the cubs, although they have been known, on rare occasions, to return to visit and rest nearby.\nMother tigers begin to take their cubs on hunts when they are about 6 months old, but they won't be able to successfully hunt for themselves until they are about 2 years old.\nOnce the tiger cubs are fairly efficient hunters, they begin to branch off from their family, slowly developing their own territory, which they will mark by clawing trees, spraying urine and leaving strategic droppings.\nYoung females with their new litters will occasional visit with their mothers to show off the grandkids. Alliances of adult females occur briefly, from time to time, but food of the size and quantity that tigers must have is scarce and requires that tigers spread out in order to survive.\nThe depletion of large game animals throughout their native lands is the single factor in the endangered status of the tiger.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Golden Lion Tamarin images!\nThe golden lion tamarin is a small monkey native to the coastal Brazil.\nSometimes called a golden marmoset, it has a long tail, reddish-gold fur, and a dramatic mane that frames its face. Due in part to a shrinking habitat, the golden lion tamarin population has dwindled dangerously near extinction, but intensive conservation efforts over the past few years have pulled it back to endangered status. Currently, less than 3,000 individuals occupy the rainforests of Brazil\u2019s southern Atlantic coast.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Facts\nFemales typically give birth to twins.\nThe golden lion tamarin has a high risk of mortality \u2013 close to 50 percent \u2013 in its first year of life.\nThis type of monkey has an average lifespan of 10 years in the wild.\nIt mainly eats fruit, nuts, and small animals.\nIt has claw-like nails rather than flat nails like other primates.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Scientific Name\nThe golden lion tamarin is a small, New World monkey that belongs to the Callitrichidae family of arboreal mammals. It shares the Leontopithecus genus with three other species:\nThe golden-headed lion tamarin or L. chrysamelus\nThe black lion tamarin or L. chrysopygus\nThe Superagui lion tamarin or L. caissara\nThe golden lion tamarin\u2019s scientific name is Leontopithecus rosalia, which refers both to its lion-like mane and its red coloring. All four tamarin species live in Brazilian rainforests.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Appearance\nA pint-sized monkey that lives in the trees, the golden marmoset has a luxurious, long reddish-gold coat that covers its entire body except for its face and paws. A ruff of fur frames its furless face and sweeps back over the ears like the mane of a lion, lending this New World monkey an exotic appearance. It also has a hank of red-gold whiskers on each cheek.\nThe tamarin\u2019s paws resemble hands, but rather than flat fingernails, or ungulae, like those of humans and other primates, the tamarin has claws, which are also called tegulae. These help it dig into tree bark to get the insects it eats and to cling to branches as it travels through the treetops.\nThe weight range for golden lion tamarins, the largest Leontopithecus species, is between 482 and 680 grams (17 and 24 ounces), so they are about the size of a gray squirrel. Tamarins measure 15 to 25 centimeters in length (6 to 10 inches). Their tails add about 32-40 centimeters (12 to 15 inches) to their length. Males and females are usually similar in size and weight.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Behavior\nLike squirrels, the tamarin travels on all fours, scurrying between tree branches 10 to 30 meters (29 to 100 feet) above the forest floor. It digs into cracks in the tree bark for insects. It pries into small holes with its deft, hairless fingers. It then shares whatever food is available with its family group.\nThese arboreal creatures are social within a core group of up to eight relatives. Like other monkeys, they groom each other, and the young ones play together. The mating pair in each family group is typically monogamous for life.\nGolden lion tamarin families are part of larger troops that mark their territory with scent to ward off outsiders. They also vocalize whining calls to warn of danger. When they are in an aggressive mode, they arch their backs, open their mouths and stare. They make peeping calls when feeling friendly.\nThese golden marmosets also have a trilling call in their vocabulary, which they use to let others in their troop know their location. They may cluck when searching for food, and screech in delight when playing.\nGroups of tamarins re-nest often as another measure to evade predators. They will nestle in the hollows of trees, bed down on a nest of vines or another sheltered spot high in the treetops. Their typical daytime routine consists of foraging for fruit and nectar in the morning and then catching insects in the afternoon. In the late afternoon to evening, they choose a new sleeping spot.\nLucas.Barros/Shutterstock.com\nGolden Lion Tamarin Habitat\nGolden lion tamarins live in three small regions of southeastern Brazil. Their rainforest habitat has shrunk to less than three percent of its former size due to human activities and encroachment. All three locations are wildlife preserves: Poco das Antas Biological Reserve, Unaio Biological Reserve, and a privately owned reserve that works with the Reintroduction Program, all in the state of Rio de Janeiro.\nDifferent troops have made adaptations to survive in various types of terrain. Due to a fractured habitat, some live in lowland coastal rainforests while others prefer forested hilltops or wetlands along Brazil\u2019s southeastern coast.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Diet\nThese tree-dwelling primates eat a diet of foods available in their rainforest canopy habitat. Because they are omnivores, they eat both animal and vegetable matter. For example, everything from spiders to small lizards finds its way into their diet, depending on local availability and season.\nThey also feast on flower nectar, tree fruits and flower petals. Their main criterion in choosing their food is whether it is small enough for them to handle. As they eat and digest fruits and flowers, they naturally disperse the seeds throughout their habitat in their feces, helping to maintain the abundance of the environment.\nThey enjoy unique adaptations that help them dig into tree bark for the insects they eat. Their slender fingers have claw-like nails rather than the flattened ones specific to other types of monkeys and to humans. These adaptations have another purpose as well. They make it safer for golden lion tamarins to travel through the treetops because their claws help them get a safer grip on the branches, reducing the risk of dangerous falls.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Predators and Threats\nA few of the animals that share the rainforest with the tamarin, or golden marmoset, prey on it too. Large birds of prey, raccoon-like coatis, snakes and margays, small Brazilian wildcats, all pose a threat of predation to the golden lion tamarin.\nHuman activities nearly drove tamarins to extinction in the 1960s, and they remain a significant, ongoing threat to the population. Clearcutting tamarin habitat for valuable wood products and charcoal-making has diminished tamarin habitat by 98 percent.\nAdditional destruction of habitat due to urban sprawl further decimates the tamarins\u2019 homes. Ranchers who cut down forestland to create grazing fields for cattle are another threat to a number of native species, as are big agricultural conglomerates expanding their farming operations.\nIn the past, the illegal trade in golden lion tamarins further challenged conservation efforts for this small, attractive species. Poachers captured them to sell as pets and zoo exhibits. The strength of the current conservation movement has minimized this once-pervasive threat, however.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nGolden marmosets are typically monogamous, with a single mating pair within a family group reproducing. Mating season begins as the rainy season draws to a close between April and June. The gestation time for a golden lion tamarin baby is four months, so the baby will be born sometime between September and February.\nTamarins usually give birth to twins, although occasionally, triplets or quadruplets make an appearance. During the first month after birth, a set of baby tamarin twins depends completely on its mother. She nurses them and carries them on her back.\nAfter those initial weeks, the entire family group helps with childcare and feeding, including the father. A baby typically begins socializing at about 17 weeks.\nThe dominant female and male of the group can begin reproducing when each is approximately two-and-a-half years old. Other mature males and females do not reproduce until they have formed their own family groups.\nTheir first year is the riskiest for these infants. The mortality rate for babies under a year of age is nearly 50 percent. After they have survived the critical first year of life, they are young adults.\nOn average, a golden lion tamarin lives about 10 to 15 years in the wild. The longest-lived are those in captivity. One captive male lived nearly 25 years.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Population\nAlthough population estimates vary, there are likely about 3,000 golden lion tamarins left in the wilds of Brazil, and nearly 500 living in zoos throughout the world. At its lowest point, the population totaled a scant 200 in the mid-20th century, but since then, numbers have gradually multiplied, thanks to the efforts of conservation groups.\nGolden Lion Tamarin in the Zoo\nThese small, active primates live in zoos throughout the world. Approximately 38 states in the U.S. host golden lion tamarins too. These include Zoo Atlanta in Georgia, Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington D.C., and Audubon Zoo in New Orleans.\nView all 111 animals that start with G"}

But animals like leopards, hyenas, and cheetahs hunt, kill, and eat lion cubs (baby lions). These predators also attack and kill sick, weak, and old lions.\nRecent studies show that humans are the most dangerous threat to lions. Human poachers will hunt them for sport as well as illegal fur trade.\nWhat Eats Lions?\n1. African Wild Dogs\nScientific Name Lycaon pictus Type of Animal Mammal Range Africa Diet Carnivore\nThe African wild dog is also called an African hunting dog or African painted dog. This animal is native to the same habitats as lions and the largest wild canine in sub-Saharan Africa.\nAfrican wild dogs and lions are natural enemies. Whenever their paths cross in the wild, it usually ends badly for the smaller wild canine predator.\nHowever, African wild dogs are intelligent enough to know they don\u2019t stand a chance in a fight with lions so will often retreat.\nHence, they stay away from the healthy and strong lions and hunt isolated and weak vubs or lionesses in packs. Furthermore, they also eat baby lions when they have the opportunity to do so.\n2. Cheetahs\nScientific Name Acinonyx jubatus Type of Animal Mammal Range Africa, Iran Diet Carnivore\nThis wild cat is the fastest animal on land, and they are primarily found in central Iran and Africa. It\u2019s estimated that the cheetah can run 80 to 128 km/h.\nCheetahs love to eat other wild animals, including lions. However, they prefer to hunt and kill cubs since they cannot kill an adult lion.\nFurthermore, the cheetah will kill and eat any injured animal, including the lion, if they have the opportunity.\n3. Crocodiles\nScientific Name Crocodylidae Type of Animal Reptile Range Australia, Africa, Central America, Florida, Asia, Northern South America Diet Carnivore\nCrocodiles are large reptiles mainly found in the tropics in Asia, the Americas, Africa, and Australia.\nThey mostly spend their time in the water. Crocodiles possess physical traits that help them to be successful predators including their amazing ability to roll and spin their prey into submission.\nThese semiaquatic reptiles are among the most successful predators. They can win fights against lions that go cooling off in shallow water because the water is the crocodile\u2019s domain.\nCrocodiles ambush lions when they are drinking or cooling off in water. Then they will drag the wild cat straight into the deep water, drowning the lion before eating it.\n4. Humans\nScientific Name Homo sapiens Type of Animal Mammal Range Global Diet Omnivore\nLion meat is not a staple meal for humans, but it has been eaten by humans in the past. Furthermore, humans are still the main predators of lions by a distance.\nHumans will shoot at lions to safeguard their territory against these dangerous wild cats. Furthermore, lions are culled due to their economic benefits. Their skin, tail, and nails are worth quite a fortune.\nToday lions are listed as endangered species due to the frequent trophy hunting and poaching by humans. And all these activities have reduced the population of lions drastically in the past 200 years.\nFor instance, the number of lions estimated to exist during the 19th century is one million. However, since 1980, humans have been responsible for the decline of lions by 50 percent.\nNevertheless, hunting lions and other wild animals is still allowed in Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. This can significantly contribute to the declining numbers of lions.\n5. Hyenas\nScientific Name Hyaena Type of Animal Mammal Range Asia, Africa, Arabian Peninsula Diet Omnivore, mostly Carnivorous\nHyenas are eternal enemies of the lions!\nThis animal forms a crucial component of many African ecosystems. The four hyena species which are well-known lions predators include;\nSpotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta)\nBrown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea)\nAardwolf (Proteles cristata)\nStriped hyena (Hyaena hyaena)\nHyenas are highly territorial and would instead steal food from their competitors than embark on a hunting spree.\nThis predator can also steal and eat lion cubs, sick and old lions, and even a lone lioness. However, a group of hyenas will only go after a single lioness if they have the numbers.\nSo, whenever a lion senses the threat of a large group of hyenas while feeding, it will protect itself by giving up its meal and allowing the hyenas to steal its prey.\n6. Leopards\nScientific Name Panthera pardus Type of Animal Mammal Range Asia, Africa Diet Carnivore\nThe leopard and lions may belong to the same family, but they are natural enemies.\nThis wild cat is a powerfully built carnivore with a broad head, long body, and relatively short legs.\nLeopards are mostly found in African savannas, woodlands, grasslands, bushvelds, and forests. This large cat is identifiable by its black speckles and golden coats.\nFurthermore, the leopard has a huge appetite and would eat only large animals, including lions, to stay well-nourished and full of energy.\nHowever, leopards would not dare to go after a pride of lions because they are not as strong as them. Instead, these solitary cats prefer to go for unprotected baby lions and eat them.\nLeopards also eat trapped or injured lions that come their way.\n7. Vultures\nScientific Name Cathartes aura (Turkey vulture) Type of Animal Bird Range Everywhere except Australia and the Polar Regions Diet Carnivore\nVultures are well-known scavengers that feed on carcasses, including recently deceased lions.\nVultures rarely go for living animals, but they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to eat carrion meat, including lions.\nVultures eat lions that die from natural causes or carcasses left behind by other predators. For instance, when a lion dies, its carrion becomes a meal for a large group of vultures.\nRelated Article: Do Lions Eat Snakes?\nHow Lions Defend Themselves from Predators\nLions protect themselves with their sharp teeth, strong claws, and large size.\nThey also live together in \u201cpride,\u201d which gives them the strength in numbers to protect themselves from predators.\nA pride of lions is made up of several females, their young, and a few males. While the female lionesses do most of the hunt due to their agility and speed, male lions use their intimidating size and strength to defend their pride.\nMale lions spend a significant part of their time on guard, watching and marking the pride\u2019s territory.\nFurthermore, some lions approach any intruder whenever the pride is under threat, while others stay behind and guard the cubs.\nRead Next: Do Lions Hibernate?\nConclusion\nLions are dominant and powerful animals which makes other predators sit up and take notice of their presence. As a result, other predators rarely hunt lions. Most creatures they stand no chance against a healthy fully-grown lion.\nHence only a few animals eat lions, including hyenas, vultures, leopards, crocodiles, African wild dogs, and cheetahs. Mostly, they will pick off weaker lions such as injured lions or cubs."}

Even buffalo cows kept in captivity refuse to be milked.\nSeeing how widespread common domestic cattle and horses are, if they coulda been, they woulda been, and sometimes you will see an individual who has given in to a saddle or cart, but as a species they are wild to the bone.\nRock on wild animals!\nWhat's the difference between wild animals and domestic animals?\nWild animals have survived in their native habitat for the entire existence of their species. They have never been selectively bred for the purposes of human beings.\nThat being said, nearly every species of animal, reptile, even fish and insects, have been held in captivity at one time or another.\nThe question is, how well do they take to that captivity, and have they been altered by it.\nThe tiger and the lion may be the first animals that comes to mind when we talk about a wild animal, but there are generations of lions and tigers that have been bred in captivity not just in zoos, where their wild behavior may be somewhat retained, but in circuses and in the pet industry.\nIn these situations, it isn't the most powerful and fearsome male that reproduces, it is the most amiable and tractable individuals, and occasionally, those with unique coat color.\nGenerations of big cats bred with tameness in mind has not made them pussycats, but in most cases it has created individuals with calmer demeanors, and even significantly smaller fangs!\nWhat is a domestic animal?\nTrue domestic animals have lived thousands of generations in captivity, and differ significantly from their wild ancestors both physically and psychologically.\nBut tameness and domestication are not the same thing.\nTameness is a degree of calm, a manageable demeanor, and a lack of aggression and fear.\nBut there are many creatures, such as silkworms, honey bees that are completely domesticated and certainly wouldn't be considered \"tame\" in the sense that we think.\nAnd the wildest of the wild, the animals we think of when we say \"wild animal\", lions and tigers, have been kept and bred in zoos, circuses and by the pet trade for centuries.\nNaturally, the most powerful and dominant of these animals is not being reproduced, and they have acquired a more docile demeanor.\nThe fangs of these big cats are even significantly smaller than their wild cousins, but are they domestic animals?\nThere are definitely alot of grey areas here, but the species that has been most clearly altered by it's relationship with human beings is, of course, the domestic dog.\nDomestic dogs are so completely engulfed in our world that they instinctively choose the company of human beings over their own species right from birth.\nThey are drawn to and transfixed by human beings, and some breeds have an incredible desire to please.\nMost domestic dogs are even born understanding the uniquely human gesture of pointing.\nSomething that the smartest animals on the planet, apes and whales, must be patiently taught to comprehend.\nDomestic horses are able to completely suppress their instincts and desires as prey animals, in order to carry us into war, on patrol, or on parade.\nAnd the domestic cat is born with a specific vocabulary word hardwired in it's brain that it only utters to human beings - yes, it seems cats only \"meow\" to people.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "lion", "title": "How Lion Taming Works | HowStuffWorks", "url": "https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/circus-arts/lion-taming.htm", "text": "\u00adIf nothing else, lion taming makes for a great metaphor. Teachers tame lions when they discipline a group of rowdy students. Business people tame lions when they assuage an angry customer or steady a snarling boss. Parents tame lions when they try to talk reason to their misbehaving teens. Taming a lion means approaching something intimidating and powerful and using your wits and learned strategies to disarm the beast.\nBut lion taming also has its literal meaning -- to tame, or rather train, the giant feline. (Nowadays, people in the field wince at the term \"tame\" and prefer the word \"train.\") When we hear the words lion taming, most of us imagine a dashing man in a top hat and tails, twirling a chair and cracking a whip at growling big cats. Indeed, that's what the lion taming acts of the circus have generally looked like, an\u00add they've been taking place for over 200 years.\nAdvertisement\n\u00adThe first circus came to the United States in 1783. At that time, the most po\u00adpular animal act was the equestrian display. Most circuses had a traveling menagerie of wild animals, but they were primarily for display. They were kept in small cages, and spectators paid to take a look at the animals up close.\nBut once the first lion tamer fearlessly stepped into the ring with a big cat, lion taming became one of the most popular acts in the circus. Tamers both male and female, dressed in fancy costumes, put on daring, theatrical shows displaying the mastery of man over beast. The methods and acts evolved over the years as our perception of animal treatment also evolved.\nA lion is a wild animal with 3-inch (7.5-centimeter) claws and a mouth that opens wider than your head is long -- 1 foot (30 centimeters). Its jaws can crush a bull's spine. Makes you wonder why anyone would even attempt to tame this beast. But they do. How?\n\u00ad"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Mountain Lion Facts - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://mail.worldatlas.com/articles/mountain-lion-facts-animals-of-north-america.html", "text": "These fascinating creatures inspire both fear and awe. They roam the mountains of the Americas, stealthily stalking their prey before finding the perfect opportunity to pounce. Mountain lions are fast and powerful with distinctly muscular bodies, sharp eyesight, and keen hearing. This predator can swim, climb trees, and jump over long distances, making them an adept hunter.\nHere are more interesting facts about the mountain lion.\nWhat Is A Mountain Lion?\nPhylum: Chordata\nChordata Class: Mammalia\nMammalia Order: Carnivora\nCarnivora Family: Felidae\nFelidae Genus: Puma\nPuma Species: concolor\nconcolor Binomial Name: Puma concolor (Linnaeus, 1771)\nMountain lions are carnivorous mammals that go by many names. They are known as the puma, panther, catamount, panther, deer tiger, and yes, cougar. They have more monikers than most other living animals. What they\u2019re called depends mainly on their location. For instance, in southern California, they are mainly called mountain lions while in Florida most refer to them as panthers.\nWhere Do Mountain Lions Live?\nMountain lions live in a wide variety of habitats. Image credit: Maciej Czekajewski/Shutterstock.com\nDue to the mountain lion\u2019s adaptability, they are known to live in many habitats and ecosystems. Apart from humans, they have the largest geographic range out of all native terrestrial mammals in the Western Hemisphere. They are found in 28 countries in the Americas, from southern Alaska to the southernmost tip of Chile in western South America.\nMountain lions can live in a wide variety of habitats like forests, prairies, deserts, and swamps. They thrive in mountainous terrain and steep, rocky canyons. They are also found are varying elevations ranging from sea level to around 3,000 m. Adult male's have a home range of over 250 km2 while females occupy anywhere around 50 to 150 km2.\nWhat Does A Mountain Lion Look Like?\nUnlike adults, mountain lion cubs have a spotted coat. Image credit: AB Photographie/Shutterstock.com\nMost mountain lions are tawny with slightly darker fur on their backs and a light to almost-white underside. Although some species living in warmer areas tend to grow fur that is darker in color which may appear reddish-brown. Those in warmer climates can have significantly lighter colored fur that appears silver-gray. The tip of the tail, snout, and ears have black markings. Cubs are born with spots that mainly disappear by the time they are nine months old.\nAn adult mountain lion in the snow. Image credit: Scott E Read/Shutterstock.com\nWhat Is The Size Of Mountain Lions?\nThe mountain lion\u2019s body from nose to tail tip is around 1.50 to 2.75 m long. Males are generally heavier than females at between 53 to 100 kg. Females can grow as heavy as 29 to 64 kg. The size of these animals vary widely depending on geographic location with the size increasing from near equatorial locations towards the poles.\nSounds Made By Mountain Lions\nUnlike other large felines, mountain lions do not roar, instead, they purr like small cats. They make low-pitched growls, hiss, and purrs similar to those made by domestic felines. Females are known to make screams to attract males which is why they are also sometimes called \u201cthe mountain screamer.\u201d\nHow Fast Can A Mountain Lion Run And How High Can It Jump?\nA young cougar running in a snowy meadow. Image credit: Dennis W Donohue/Shutterstock.com\nMountain lions, like cheetahs, have a flexible spine that lets them maneuver around obstacles or change the course of their run right away making them extremely fast runners and adept hunters. They are known to run as fast as 64 to 80 km per hour.\nA jumping cougar. Image credit: Vaclav Sebek/Shutterstock.com\nThese mammals have extremely strong legs that help them jump long distances. Their muscular hind legs allow them to jump as high as 18 feet from the ground, although they are also known to jump up to 20 feet up or down mountains. They are known to leap from the ground to trees or jump from trees to pounce on prey on the ground.\nWhat Do Mountain Lions Eat?\nMountain lions are carnivores, which means that they feed on other animals to survive. Its main prey is deer including the white-tailed deer, the elk, and even the largest ones, the moose. They are also known to hunt and eat other animals like goats and sheep or rodents like rabbits, capybaras, and porcupines. They are known to attack livestock and even animals twice their size like cattle and horses. They can even eat small animals like mice and birds.\nWhen Are Mountain Lions Most Active?\nMountain lions are most active at night. They can be prowling during the day but they are most active at night most especially at dusk and dawn. During this time their primary prey, the deer, is also actively out roaming in the open.\nSignificance Of Mountain Lions\nLike every species on planet Earth, cougars also play an integral role in the ecosystems that they are part of. Being apex predators, their role in controlling the herbivore population is vital.\nMountain lions are also regarded as an umbrella species which means their conservation amounts to conserving all other species sharing their habitat. These predators occupy massive spaces - about 13 times the area occupied by black bears and 40 times that needed by a bobcat to thrive. Hence, preserving mountain lion habitats saves countless other species living there.\nImage credit: Mikhail Kolesnikov/Shutterstock.com\nDo Mountain Lions Attack People?\nAttacks on humans are extremely rare. They would rather flee than fight and they rarely try to confront humans. But since many developments have encroached on the animal\u2019s habitats, encounters are becoming all too common. A cougar may attack if they feel cornered and usually bite the neck when attacking.\nWhat Is The Current Conservation Status Of Mountain Lions?\nA mountain lion emerging through the bush. Image credit: Baranov E/Shutterstock.com\nThey are listed as of \u201cLeast Concern\u201d by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. However, organizations like Panthera warn that their numbers are steadily declining across their range.\nThe historic range of this species included nearly the entire Americas but now they are confined to only 28 countries. They were almost exterminated from eastern US due to extensive hunting throughout the 19th and 20th centuries as they were considered a risk to livestock. In the western US, mountain lion populations are currently stable but far lower than the historical figures. In 2011, a subspecies of the mountain lion, the eastern cougar was declared extinct by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Another mountain lion population, the Florida panther, is listed as critically endangered in the US endangered species list.\nWhat Are The Threats To Mountain Lions?\nHumans pose the biggest threat to these animals. Aside from encroaching on their habitat for urban development, humans also hunt these animals so much so that their populations are depleted in many parts of the Americas. Both legal and illegal hunting of mountain lions contributes to their decline. Many are hunted out of people's fear of these animals, some are hunted because they are valued as trophies.\nAnother emerging threat to mountain lions comes from reintroduced gray wolves. Research has shown that in areas where gray wolves were reintroduced, mountain lion populations have fallen. Wolves are known to prey on cougar cubs and are also attack and kill adult cougars using the advantage of pack hunting strategies."}

It\u2019s time for some handy-dandy The Lion King facts. Here are some things you may not have known about your favorite pride of lions.\nLion King Facts\n42. Expensive carpets\u2026\nRemember when Mufasa asks Zazu what he should do with Scar? Zazu replies, \u201cHe\u2019d make a very handsome throw rug.\u201d Turns out, someone at Disney thought this was a great idea\u2014in 1997\u2019s Hercules, Scar makes a subtle cameo in the form of a throw rug.\n41. The first banishment\nIn the original storyline, Nala was going to be banished from Pride Rock because for ignoring Scar\u2019s romantic advances. It was during this banishment that she would find Simba alive and well with Timon and Pumbaa. Disney ultimately abandoned this plan.\n40. Casting switcheroo\nThe original game plan for the hyenas was to reunite Cheech & Chong. Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai, but Tommy Chong was unavailable. Tommy\u2019s role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.\n39. Not quite prepared\nJim Cummings replaced Jeremy Irons for the finale of \u201cBe Prepared.\u201d Irons messed up his voice while performing the line, \u201cYou won\u2019t get a sniff without me!\u201d The rest of his recording just didn\u2019t sound powerful enough, so Jim stepped in to save the day.\n38. The lone African accent\nRafiki is the only character in the film to not have an American or English accent, and who speaks Swahili from time to time.\n37. Ouch\nDuring the scene where Simba gets pinned down by Nala, Jonathan Taylor Thomas was actually smacked on the back to make it sound like he had the wind knocked out of him.\n36. Hello, Mickey!\nIn the scene where Mufasa tells Simba about the Great Kings of the Past, you can see Mickey Mouse if you look at the stars in the wide shot.\n35. A little improv\nNathan Lane (Timon) ad-libbed the line \u201cWhat do you want me to do, dress in drag and do the hula?\u201d Yes, Nathan. That is precisely what we want you to do.\n34. Timon and Pumbaa shouldn\u2019t have \u201ctaken\u201d Simba\nLiam Neeson was considered for the role of Mufasa.\nSign up to our newsletter.

Claws out, Scar!\nUnlike the other lions, Scar\u2019s claws are always out in the film.\n32. The opening scene\nThe opening scene of The Lion King was thought to be so powerful that it was the first time ever Disney chose to use an entire scene as a film trailer.\n31. A three-year stampede\nIt took Disney\u2019s CG department a whopping three years to animate the wildebeest scene in the film. They even had to create a whole new program to ensure the animals could run without bumping into one another.\n30. King of inaccuracy\nOne of the original titles for the film was King of the Jungle, until the folks at Disney figured out that lions don\u2019t live in the jungle. This was clearly pre-Wikipedia.\n29. Unique as a snowflake\nThe Lion King was the first Disney venture to feature an original plot \u2013 as in not an adaptation. It had inspirations as all stories do, but it was not directly linked to any other story.\n28. The backup plan\nDisney actually used their \u201cteam B\u201d to make the The Lion King, because their \u201cteam A\u201d was busy making Pocahontas \u2013 which was slated to be a more successful production. As it turned out, the latter received very mixed reviews and was not nearly as profitable as The Lion King.\n27. No Hakuna Matata\nOriginally, the film did not feature the iconic song \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d, it instead had a song about eating insects called \u201cHe\u2019s Got It All Worked Out.\u201d Alas, a song about bugs was a tough sell to the rest of the team, so they went with \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d \u2013 which was based on a phrase Disney\u2019s research team brought back from Africa.\n26. Shakespearean vibes\nThe Lion King drew inspiration from William Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet. Say, whaaa?\n25. Rafiki is not quite a real animal\nThe character Rafiki is a bit of a cross between a mandrill and a baboon. He bears most of his resemblance with a mandrill, except mandrills don\u2019t have tails \u2013 this was a trait borrowed from the baboons by the Disney animators.\n24. Mickey\u2019s cameo\nA yellow insect Timon finds under a log has Mickey ears on its back. Don\u2019t you love finding these things?\n23. Jeremy Irons blew the animators away\nThe Disney animators were so impressed with Jeremy Irons\u2019 performance as Scar that they incorporated his features into the character\u2019s appearance.\n22. A huge dub-step\nThe Lion King is the first Disney venture to be dubbed into Zulu for its release in Africa.\n21. Original tragic ending\nThis film was initially much darker than the final version. Originally, Simba loses to Scar in the final scene, with Scar then dying in the fire. Yowza, that\u2019s too moody for us.\nThe Lion King, Walt Disney Pictures\n20. Brothers, but not so much\nThe reason Scar and Mufasa look so different is due to the fact that Disney originally planned for them to not be related. Scar was just some outsider lion, who came in to stir things up.\nThe Lion King, Walt Disney Pictures\n19. All about the Benjamins\nDisney reportedly made over $1 billion off The Lion King merchandise in 1994. Not too shabby!\n18. Hitler reference\nThe scene with the hyenas marching past Scar on a rock during the \u201cBe Prepared\u201d song was inspired by footage of Nazis marching past Adolf Hitler.\n17. On-screen murder\nThis is the only Disney film to show a villain (Scar, of course) committing murder. Usually, characters are killed off-screen.\n16. Real-life experience\nA team of animators was sent to Africa to study the nature and animal behaviour before starting on the production. A lion and a cub were even brought to the studio for life drawing to ensure accuracy.\n15. No return of the king\nOriginally, Mufasa was not supposed to return after his death, but Simba needed a reason to return to Pride Rock \u2013 hence the \u201capparition\u201d of his father.\n14. Strangers in the hall\nDespite sharing many scenes, Matthew Broderick (Simba) and Nathan Lane (Timon) only saw each other once during the entire production of the film \u2013 and it was in the hall! Both actors did their voice recording separately.\n13. Too sad for children\nMufasa\u2019s death is obviously a very intense scene to watch as a child and arguably one of the most traumatic moments in Disney\u2019s animation history. Yet, the scene of his death was initially even more sad, but had to be toned down after a test audience of children reacted with extreme sobbing to the original version.\n12. Started from the bottom\nPumbaa is the first character in Disney history to display \u2013 err, how shall we put this delicately \u2013 flatulence. In other words, he\u2019s the first to launch an air biscuit onscreen for team Disney. Go Pumbaa!\n11. Reunited and it feels so good\nThis is the second film to feature the acting talents of James Earl Jones (Mufasa) and Madge Sinclair (Sarabi) as African king and queen. The first time we saw this pair on screen together was in the comedy Coming to America \u2013 in which they were the monarchs of a fictional African country.\n10. Let it go, let it go!\nThe Lion King held the record for highest grossing animated film for over a decade, until it was dethroned in 2013 by another Disney feature \u2013 Frozen.\n9. The original plot\nThis may seem silly now, given how great the film turned out, but originally Disney planned The Lion King to focus on a conflict between lions and baboons. Scar was planned as the leader of the baboons and Rafiki was going to be a cheetah.\n8. From hyena to meerkat and warthog\nNathan Lane (Timon) and Ernie Sabella (Pumbaa) originally auditioned for the roles of the hyenas. The team loved their interaction so much, they cast them as Timon and Pumbaa instead.\n7. Nala\u2019s mother\nDespite the name never appearing in the film, Nala\u2019s mother is named Sarafina. The named is in the credits and was used on some of The Lion King\u2019s merchandise.\n6. Livin\u2019 on a prayer\nAdult Simba\u2019s glorious mane was allegedly inspired by the iconic locks of Jon Bon Jovi. Those are some serious rockstar vibes.\n5. Not feeling the love tonight\nYou may have to sit down for this one\u2026 Disney initially wanted \u201cCan You Feel the Love Tonight?\u201d to be a duet between Timon and Pumbaa. Elton John naturally protested and the scene was changed \u2013 winning the singer an Academy Award.\n4. Thank you, Japan\nDisney faced some criticism for ripping off story elements from Kimba the White Lion. Did they \u201cborrow\u201d too much?\nKimba the White Lion, Mushi Production\n3. Human roars\nVoice actor Frank Welker provided the roars for all the lions in the animated feature. No real lion roars were used in the film, because the creators wanted each animal to have his/her own unique roar.\n2. Hyenas\nDisney made some serious modifications when it comes to animal behavior. For example, the hyenas are depicted as dog-like throughout the film, when in reality, the closest relatives to hyenas are mongooses and meerkats. Disney also reversed the hunter-scavenger relationship. In the wild, hyenas actually kill most of the meat they eat, while lions are more likely to scavenge.\n1. Who you calling a baboon?\nThe song that Rafiki sings, \u201cAsante sana, squash banana, wewe nugu mimi hapana,\u201d is often said to be Swahili for \u201cThank you very much, squash banana, you\u2019re a baboon and I\u2019m not.\u201d\nSources: 1, 2, 3"}

They typically grow much larger than either parent species.\nAnother hybrid from the mating of the same animals \u2013 only reversed, a male Tiger and a female Lion \u2013 is known as the Tigon, and are often much smaller.\nLiger Facts Overview\nHabitat: Do not occur naturally in the wild. Location: Zoos & private ownership. Lifespan: 15 \u2013 25 Years Size: 9.8 \u2013 12 ft (3 to 3.6 m) Weight: 705 \u2013 1,200 pounds (320 \u2013 550 kg) Color: Tawny, with feint tiger stripes. Diet: Wild deer, boar Predators: No natural predators, but potentially other big cats. Top Speed: 80 kph (50 mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nNot listed\nLigers tend to be more like a lion, than a tiger.\nThey are large, muscly and male ligers will have a mane, like a male lion, but often shorter than their father\u2019s. They have dark tawny fur, with broad heads. They often have feint tiger stripes, inherited from their mother. Ligers are fond of swimming, just like Tigers (lions don\u2019t like water), and are also quite sociable, just like lions.\nThe Liger is not a new hybrid as they date back to the early 19th century in India. The name was coined to describe the creature in the 1930s. The Liger has appeared in art as far back as 1798 when a color plate depicted one, and in 1825 a Liger and its parents appeared in an engraving. A pair of Liger cubs born in 1837 were even put on display for King William IV and Queen Victoria who succeeded him.\nWhile thought to be extremely rare, historically lions and tigers may have interbred to produce ligers in the wild. The Asiatic lion once inhabited a much larger area of Asia, that may have meant it shared some territory with tigers. However, today, they are very much only cross bred in captivity, either accidentally or more often, purposefully as a rare attraction.\nInteresting Liger Facts\n1. The Liger is the largest known cat in the world.\nMale Ligers can reach a length of 10 to 12-feet which makes them slightly larger than even large male lions or tigers in length. They weigh considerably more than a Tiger or Lion. A non-obese male Liger named Hercules was recognized as being the largest living cat on Earth in 2013, when he weighed a total of 922 pounds. He measured 3.33 m (131 in) and stood at 1.25 m (49 in) at the shoulder.\n2. It\u2019s estimated that there are fewer than 100 Ligers in existence.\nThe exact number is unknown, but this approximation is from Usman Masood who runs the website ligerzoos.com, and tracks reports of genuine ligers from around the world.\nThe USA is thought to hold the largest number of ligers, around 30 are in private hands. This is followed by China with approx. 20. The photo below is a Liger in the Siberian Tiger Park, Harbin, China.\nSouth Korea, Germany, Russia and South Africa each have a few Ligers in captivity.\n3. Ligers often suffer from obesity because they don\u2019t get enough exercise in their small habitats and cages.\nThis makes them even larger. A Liger named Nook living in the Valley of the Kings animal sanctuary in Wisconsin weighed over 1,200-pounds (before dying in 2007).\n4. Ligers can experience gigantism while dwarfism is known to occur in Tigons.\nAnimals species have a natural hormone that stops them from over growing in one of their parents. A slight mutation can stop them having it. But in the case of a liger, it\u2019s the female lion which carries the hormone to stop growth. So a male lion genes combined with a female tiger results in a much larger cat in the form of a liger.\n5. The Liger is not alone as being a large cat hybrid.\nThere are other big cat hybrids that can measure up close to the size of the Liger. The Litigon, which happens to be a rare hybrid from a male Lion and female Tigon, can grow to just about the same size as the Liger. One such example was a male Litagon named Cubanacan who weighed a total of 800-pounds. He lived in the Alipore Zoo in India.\n6. Ligers appear to have a growth spurt early in the lives.\nHormonal issues probably contribute to this. The Liger grows fast when very young and then slows down as it approaches their adult size. By the time they reach six years of age, all the growing has taken place. The female Liger is also large in size growing up to 700-pounds and a length of 10-feet.\n7. Ligers have relatively long lives.\nA female Liger named Shasta born in 1948 at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City, Utah lived to the age of 24. Hobbs, a male Liger lived to just about 15 years. He was in the Sierra Safari Zoo in Reno, Nevada and succumbed to liver failure.\n8. Hybrid big cats are known to be fertile.\nThere is a great deal of documentation on this subject. In fact, the fertility of big cat females includes many different hybrids. There is actually a rule that describes it: in hybrid animals, where their sex is determined by sex chromosomes, if one sex is absent, rare or happens to be sterile, the animal will be born heterogametric \u2013 the sex that had two different sex chromosomes. It is called Haldane\u2019s Rule. There are other hybrids in the animal kingdom that are actually sterile.\n9. Ligers are fast. They have been clocked running up to 50mph.\nThe size of the liger does not inhibit their running speed, they are as fast as a Lion and generally considered by experts as faster. If you were being chased by one, the weight of the animal hitting you would knock the wind out of you, or render you unconscious.\n10. The Liger shares more traits with a lion, than a tiger.\nAs a Liger is the hybrid offspring of a Lion and a Tiger, it carries many different traits from both parents. However, the Liger has far more traits from the Lion parent than it does from the Tiger parent.\nOr at least that is the findings of several researchers who have observed Ligers both in the wild and in captivity. Naturally, they live longer in captivity than in the wild.\n11. A Ligers roar sounds like a lion.\nAs the Liger is essentially a cross between a Tiger and a Lion, the Liger roar sounds a lot like the roar of a Lion. However, there are circumstances when the Liger roar will sound more like the roar of a Tiger as well.\n12. The majority of Ligers born until recent decades, were actually the result of accidents.\nThat is to say, the breeding was not intentional. However, more recently they have been bred purposefully in captivity as a unique attraction.\n13. Lions and tigers don\u2019t overlap in the wild today, except in one location \u2013 India\u2019s Gir Forest.\nUntil now, no ligers have been found there. Typically they don\u2019t cross the species line, and are not interested in each other. It\u2019s been argued that crossbreeding will only occur in unique circumstances, such as when stuck in captivity and there are no other mates available of the same species.\n14. Ligers having poor immune systems is a myth.\nWhile it\u2019s often argued that one of the problems of being a hybrid is that the immunity system gets compromised, actually Ligers appear to have hybrid vigor. This means quite the opposite, they are often fit, healthy, bigger and stronger. However, while Ligers haven\u2019t been studied at great length, there are arguments that they have a greater chance of genetic issues and other defects.\n15. The tiger mother requires help at birth.\nAs the Liger is considered one of the biggest cats on the planet, the Tiger mother usually requires a C-section in order to properly deliver the Liger cub as it will be larger than a normal Tiger cub.\n16. Ligers were popularised in the 2004 cult classic movie, Napoleon Dynamite.\nThe liger was \u2018pretty much\u2019 the favourite animal of the socially awkward Napoleon.\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\nHe\u2019d spend time doodling them, and other fantasy creatures.\n17. Crossbreeding of Ligers is often considered as unethical.\nConservation scientist Luke Dollar argues that any crossbreeding between big cat species is unethical and is the result of greed or irresponsible breeding. \u201cI can think of no legit excuse for a liger or tigon to exist. If we want to recognize and honor big cats as they naturally occur in the wild, why would we possibly experiment in these completely unnatural and not biologically founded practices?\u201d Accredited zoos frown on crossbreeding big cats and often Ligers can be found in private hands and outside main zoos. 18. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), the accrediting body for zoos in North America, does not approve of Ligers. Steve Feldman a spokesperson from the AZA says Zoos should instead focus on wildlife-conservation programs.\nLiger Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Suborder: Feliformia Family: Felidae Subfamily: Pantherinae Genus:\nPanthera Genus:\nP.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "African Lion Facts - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/african-lion-facts", "text": "The numbers of African lions are sadly on a rapid decline. These vulnerable species face constant threat due to loss of habitat and poaching. Here are some interesting facts about African lions, and why they are still such a majestic lot, even today.\nScientific Name: Panthera leo\nLifespan: 12 \u2013 15 years in the wild, 20 \u2013 25 years in captivity\nStatus: Vulnerable\nFondly known as the \u2018king of the jungle\u2019, lions are the only cats to live in groups, which are called prides. Here, we\u2019ll look at all the interesting facts related to the African lion.\nCharacteristics\nAfrican lions are very strong animals, yet beautiful to look at too. The males typically have a yellowish-brown coat, and thick dark-brown mane which encircles the neck. Their tails are long, and at the end there is a horny spine covered with a tuft of hair. Lions are the 2nd largest living feline species, after the tiger. A male is approximately 4 feet tall and 6 to 8 feet in length. A female is approximately 3.5 feet tall and 5 to 6 feet long. A lion can weigh anywhere in between 350 to 550 pounds, whereas, a lioness could weigh somewhere between 250 to 400 pounds.\nHabitat\nAfrican lions used to live in most parts of the continent of Africa. Due to various reasons, their numbers have halved since the 1950s, and today they stand at a population of just around 20,000. Their habitat spans the savannas, grasslands, dense bush, and woodlands. At present, they are found only in sub-Saharan Africa, with a very few populating India.\nDiet\nA surprising fact is that lions are big scavengers. More than half the food that they eat is taken over from cheetahs, hyenas, and leopards. And of course, they hunt in packs, which allows them to make big kills like wildebeests, zebras, buffaloes, young elephants, rhinos, impalas, wild hogs, hippos, and giraffes. They even tend to hunt and eat lizards, mice, tortoises, antelopes, crocodiles, and warthogs. In captivity, they are mostly fed chickens, rabbits, beef, and mutton.\nBehavior\nLions live in large groups called prides, which consist of about 15 lions. One to three males are part of a pride for around three years, until another group of males take over. The rest in the pride are females and the young. These are affectionate animals, and love touching, licking, purring, and rubbing. Most of the hunting is done by the females. They have the tendency to creep stealthily toward their prey and suddenly ambush them. The males are territorial, and their job is to protect the pride. Ironically, the males eat first, and that too most of the share of the prey, followed by the females and young. Lions are actually pretty lazy, and spend 16 \u2013 20 hours of the day either resting or sleeping.\nReproduction\nAfrican lions mate all year round. The gestation period is 110 days, and a female usually has a litter of three to four cubs, with each weighing 3 pounds. The young begin hunting when they are nearly a year old, and live with the mother until they are two years of age. The cubs are very vulnerable to predators like hyenas, leopards, black-backed jackals, etc., and less than half that are born make it past the first year.\nPredators\nHumans are the main predators of lions. For centuries, these magnificent animals have been killed as hunting trophies and for certain medicinal values. Loss of habitat has also contributed to their dwindling numbers, which is why they are at present categorized as \u2018vulnerable\u2019.\nOther Interesting Facts\nThe males defend their territory fiercely, and mark it with urine to demarcate the area. The territory may include 100 square miles (259 square kilometers) of grasslands or open woodlands. Once they sense intruders, they are known to roar menacingly as a sign of warning. Their roars are powerful enough to be heard as far as 5 miles away.\nThese majestic lions prefer to spend a hot day in some shady and dense vegetation. Their activity begins after dusk. Hunting mostly occurs from nighttime to dawn. These lions, although inactive when they are not hunting, can walk close to 15 miles a day, if required. A pride can stick to a specific area if it finds sufficient quantity of water and a good hunting ground.\nThese lions are generally tawny. At times, their color may vary. This could be from silvery yellow to ocher-tinted gray or dark ocher brown with paler undersides. The young ones have faint spots (like a leopard), which disappear as they come of age. Sometimes, these are retained even if they reach adulthood. The tuft of the tail is generally black.\nThey are known to have a variety of facial expressions. These serve the purpose of visual gestures. They also have a variety of different roars with variations in the intensity and the pitch of the roars. Lionesses use grunting sounds to call their cubs. The roar of a female lion is slightly softer than the male. The sounds of the African lion include snarling, hissing, coughing, roaring, and purring. A full roar is possible only when they reach adulthood.\nThey are known to prefer larger prey, which provides ample food for the whole pride. The prey usually consists of zebras, impalas, wild boars, deer, giraffes, etc. There is a peculiar manner in which they stalk their prey. The females hunt in groups and sneak up to the prey. They use short bursts of speed and encircle the herd. They rush onto the nearest victim and kill it by means of strangulation.\nMales are known to kill the cubs in any pride they conquer. This is because, the lioness does not become fertile and receptive to a new male until her cubs grow up.\nWhen a lion breeds with a tiger, the result is a liger or tigon. When it breeds with a leopard, the cub is called a leopon, and with a jaguar, the result is a jaglion.\nThese beasts can run as fast as 50 mph, for short distances, and can leap as far as 35 feet.\nThe mane of a male acts as protection when it is involved in a fight.\nWhile walking, the heels of a lion do not touch the ground.\nThey love to drink water every day, but these animals can go up to 5 to 6 days without having any water.\nThe condition of African lions in captivity is known to have improved off late, but the fact remains that they do not always have the freedom to move around, as would be the case in their natural habitat. It is only recently we can see these majestic creatures being housed in naturalistic areas with closer attention being paid to their needs."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Gal\u00e1pagos Sea Lion - Facts, Diet, Habitat & Pictures on Animalia.bio", "url": "https://animalia.bio/galapagos-sea-lion", "text": "Habits and Lifestyle\nGal\u00e1pagos sea lions are very social and on land, they form colonies in their hauling-out areas. Adult males are the head of the colony. As they grow, they fight to win dominance of a harem of between five and 25 cows, and the surrounding territory. Males in this species are two types: territorial and non-territorial. Territorial males vocalize at higher rates and vocalization is important to them because it plays a key role in the selection of female and helps ward off intruding non-territorial males into their harem. The average dominant bull holds his territory for only a few months until he is challenged by another male. Because there is only one male in each harem, there is always a surplus of \u201cbachelor\u201d male sea lions. They usually congregate fairly peaceably on less favorable areas of the coastline in \u201cbachelor colonies\u201d. Because the dominant male cannot feed while defending his colony, he eventually becomes too tired and weak and is overpowered by a well-nourished, fresh bull. Gal\u00e1pagos sea lions become active at sunrise when the dominant bull first enters the water to feed followed by the rest of the group. Most of the time is spent in the water hunting, or just to cool down from the heat. They rarely travel far from the shore and, when threatened will flee from the water as quickly as possible. The rest of the time they spend on the beach. Gal\u00e1pagos sea lions are quite vocal. Adult males often bark. Females and juveniles do not bark, but both sexes of younger pups growl. From birth, a mother sea lion recognizes her pup\u2019s distinct bark and finds her offspring from a crowd of barking sea lions."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Thylacoleo Animal Facts - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/animals/thylacoleo/", "text": "This post may contain affiliate links to our partners like Chewy, Amazon, and others. Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Thylacoleo images!\nThe thylacoleo was a genus of animals that contained the largest carnivore that ever lived in Australia and had the most powerful bite of any mammal, whether extant or extinct.\nThylacoleo Description and Size\nPaleontologists believe that the largest species of this animal, T. carnifex stood around 30 inches tall at the shoulder and 59 inches long and weighed about 223 to 287 pounds. Though that would have made the animal about the same size as a lioness or a jaguar, scientists have speculated that its bite force was equivalent to that of a 551 pound lion, and modern lions rarely grow that big. Interestingly, the thylacoleo, also called the marsupial lion was not really a lion but a marsupial like a kangaroo or an opossum. This meant that its young were born at a very early stage and developed in their mother\u2019s pouch. Still, thylacoleo had some catlike features. They included:\nRetractable claws like a cat\nA short skull that allowed it to have stronger biting muscles in its jaw.\nAn ability to climb trees like many cats. It may have even lived in the trees.\nThylacoleo also had thumbs that were somewhat opposable. These thumbs bore huge claws. The animal used these claws to catch their prey and then eviscerate it. It didn\u2019t have a tail like a cat or a lion but one that was most like the tail of a kangaroo. It was made up of powerful bones called chevrons that supported the animal like a tripod when it stood on its hind legs. This left its forelegs free to grab and slash at prey.\nThe thylacoleo also had very specialized teeth, especially its cheek teeth. These teeth had evolved into modified shearing blades, and they joined upper incisors that were large and serrated and nearly horizontal lower incisors. These teeth evolved at the expense of the animal\u2019s canines and back molars, which were either much smaller or altogether absent.\nDespite its fearsome equipment, thylacoleo was not a fast runner and probably ambushed its prey, possibly by dropping down on it from a tree or bursting out of a bush when an animal came within striking distance. Paleontologists also believe that this hunting technique probably led to the animal having spots or stripes, which would have camouflaged it. The second and third toes on its hind feet were also fused, which is a characteristic of animals found in its order, Diprotodontia.\nOrigin of Its Name\nThylacoleo means \u201cpouch lion.\u201d The name comes because the animal was both a marsupial and resembled a lion in its strength, ferocity, and hunting prowess. The order it belonged to, Diprotodontia, is Greek for \u201ctwo forward teeth,\u201d and describes the animal\u2019s dentition.\nDiet: What Did the Thylacoleo Eat?\nThe thylacoleo was a carnivore and certainly an apex predator wherever it was found. It is believed that one of its most favored prey animals was diprotodon, another marsupial that is now extinct. Diprotodon was the largest marsupial that ever lived, and was the size of a hippopotamus. Its length was nearly 10 feet, and it weighed over 3 tons. Yet, the thylacoleo was powerful enough to take it down. Interestingly, diprotodon belonged to the same order as the thylacoleo and its skull, though much larger, looks very much like the skull of thylacoleo. However, diprotodon was an herbivore, and its closest living relatives appear to be modern wombats.\nAnother animal favored by thylacoleo was Palorchestes, another large member of the Diprotodontia order. Like diprotodon, it was a four-legged herbivore. Some paleontologists believe that this animal had a short trunk that helped it browse from trees. Thylacoleo also preyed on Procoptodon and Sthenurus, both giant kangaroos. Though Procoptodon stood over 6.5 feet tall, Sthenurus stood around 10 feet. Thylacoleo seemed not to be adept at catching small prey, so it specialized in these large animals. It\u2019s also believed to have been a scavenger and was big and bold enough to drive other scavengers away from a carcass.\nHabitat: When and Where It lived\nThe marsupial lion ranged over most of Australia during the late Pliocene and much of the Pleistocene epochs, which was 1.6 million to 11,700 years ago. It could be found in woods, scrublands and semi-desert areas that had bodies of water.\nThreats And Predators\nVery few animals threatened the formidable adult thylacoleo, but it did have to compete with some frankly terrifying neighbors. One of them was the Quinkana, a crocodile that ranged from 6.5 to nearly 20 feet long. Moreover, this crocodile was terrestrial judging from its long legs and its knife-like, serrated teeth. These teeth were meant to slice into a prey animal and cause it to bleed to death as opposed to dragging it underwater and drowning it. Another potential threat was a goanna called Varanus priscus, or Megalania. This lizard ranged from 14.7 to 23 feet long and could grow even larger. The thylacoleo also had to contend with a 16 to 20-foot-long snake called the Wonambi naracoortensis.\nOf course, the biggest threats thylacoleo eventually had to face were humans, who arrived in Australia about 60,000 years ago. Even if humans managed to steer clear of this predator, their methods of hunting and farming drastically reduced the number of the marsupial lion\u2019s prey animals. Some also believe that climate change put pressure on the thylacoleo and the other Australian megafauna, but it was most likely humans that did them in the end.\nDiscoveries and Fossils: Where It was Found\nSome people believe that the first thylacoleo fossils were discovered in the 1830s in New South Wales, Australia by Thomas Mitchell, but the animal was first described in 1859 by the British biologist and paleontologist Sir Richard Owen. These fossils were bits and pieces of the animal, and part of a skull of T. carnifex was discovered in 1843 by William Adeney. He found part of the nose of the same animal about 33 years later in Lake Colongulac in southeastern Australia.\nSince then, many fossilized remains of thylacoleo have been discovered around Australia, but the first almost complete thylacoleo skeleton wasn\u2019t found until 1966. Some of the more notable were eight nearly complete skeletons that were found in a cave in Nullarbor Plain in southern Australia. These animals apparently fell through a crevasse into the cave. Some were killed outright by the fall, while others survived but couldn\u2019t get out and starved to death. These fossils are now found in The Australian Museum.\nExtinction: When Did It Die Out?\nPaleontologists believe that the main cause of the thylacoleo\u2019s extinction was human activity, but the climate had been drying out in the animal\u2019s range for hundreds of thousands of years. This might have caused a decrease in thylacoleo\u2019s prey, but it\u2019s believed the real culprit was humans simply hunting the animal to extinction around 30,000 years ago as well as hunting its prey. Interestingly, no other large carnivorous marsupial has filled the niche of the thylacoleo in Australia.\nSimilar Animals to the Thylacoleo\nThe Pleistocene epoch seems to have been a time for huge and frankly scary creatures, including mammals. Thylacoleo was a rather unique animal, being an apex predator as well as a marsupial and possibly descended from an herbivore. But other animals that may have been somewhat like it include:\nPropleopus oscillans. This is the Pleistocene epoch giant rat kangaroo of Australia. It grew to between 5 and 10 feet in height, weighed 150 pounds and was an omnivore, with teeth made to tear and grind.\nHomotherium. This is the sabertooth cat that lived in much of the world, save Asia and Australia during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs.\nThylacinus megiriani. This was also a carnivorous, predatory marsupial. It walked on all fours and looked like a dog with an exceptionally long snout. It weighed between 85.3 and 126 pounds.

(Now in a different zoo.)\nExtensive revision 2-15-2004\nBasic Facts\nPhysical Characteristics\nThe lion is a member of the cat family, and shares many common traits of this family. The body is very muscular, with less bone mass than other animals of comparable size. This is also responsible for the grace of movement we associate with members of the cat family. The forebody of the lion is very powerfully built, and has the greatest forebody strength of any cat, except possibly the tiger. This enables the lion to deliver blows with it's forepaws heavy enough to break a zebra's back. The bones of the front legs are twisted in such a manner as to give a great range of motion to the forelimb.\nEach paw is equipped with soft pads to make it's movements quiet. Like most carnivores, lions are digitigrade walkers. This means they essentially walk on their toes. But, the majority of the animal's weight is borne by the main paw pads, which would correspond on a human to the palm of the hand at the base of the fingers. Extra bones in the toe joints give the toes a wide range of motion.The claws are retractible and very sharp. The retractable feature helps keep the claws sharp, and prevents injury during play, etc. The dewclaw on the front limbs is often used as a toothpick. The claws grow as a series of layers. As a layer wears, it is shed, and a new sharp-pointed claw is exposed. The claw on a large lion can be 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) or more from base to tip along the curve.\nThe body is covered with a sandy brown coat in most subspecies of lions, but there is a white variant that shows up once in a while, especially in the Timbavati region of South Africa. (The white variant is also showing up more and more among captive lion populations.) Lions with a very dark brown coat have been observed, but this is quite rare. The coat color of a lion is not determined so much by the color of the hair, but by the ratio of light-colored hairs to dark-colored hairs.\nThe mature male lion has a mane that covers the backside of the head, and the shoulders. The extent of the mane varies from individual to individual, with some having no mane at all, while others have a luxurious mane that runs onto the body, along the abdomen, and even onto the fronts of the back legs in exceptional specimins. The mane varies in color from the rest of the body, and tends to grow darker with age. Some lions in the Serengeti area and from North Africa have a nearly black mane. Just like th body hair, the mane color is determined by the ratio of dark hairs to light hairs present. The mane hair is stiff and wiry, like stiff horeshair. Besides it's primary role of protecting the male during fights, it has been discovered that female lions prefer males with bigger and darker manes.\nThe eyes are proportinately larger than in other comparable-sized animals, and posess round pupils. Lions, like most cats, are visual animals. The eyes are also well-adapted for use under very low light. This helps the lion hunt at night. Contrtry to popular notion, a lion's eyes do not glow in the dark, but they contain a special reflective coating that will reflect even moonlight. This coating increses the lion's visual acuity in very low light by ensuring that every possible photon of light makes it to the cells in the retina. Their eyes are effective even by starlight. A white circle just below the eyes helps reflect light into the eyes to further improve night vision. Like most mammals, lions have a nictitating membrane which serves to clean and protect the eye in some circumstances. Lions, like most cats, have limited ability to move their eyes side-to-side, and must turn the head to look in a different direction.\nThe sense of smell is well developed. Lions mark their territories by means of scent deposits, necessitating a good sense of smell. This also helps them find kills made by other predators, and perhaps obtain an easy meal by driving the other predator off their kill. Another interesting thing that lions and all other cats posess is a special olfactory organ on the roof of the mouth called a Jacobson's organ. Sometimes, you will see a lion, or even your cat, grimace when smelling something. They are opening their lips to draw air over their jacobson's organs. This grimacing gesture is called Flehmen.\nThe sense of hearing is perhaps only slightly above average. The ears can be swiveled over a wide angle to enable the lion to hear distant sounds, and know what direction they are coming from.\nThe lion's tail is the only one in the cat family with a tassel at the tip. (Ligers also have a tassel, but they are not found in the wild.) This tassel conceals a spine, which is the last few tail bones fused together. What function this spine serves, if any, is unknown. The tail is very important for overall balance. Females also use their raised tail as a 'follow me' signal for the cubs. They also use it to signal each other during a group hunt.\nThe lion's teeth are well adapted for killing their prey and eating it. The great canine teeth are spaced such that they can slip between the cervical vertebrae of their favorite-sized prey animals, and sever the spinal cord. The shape of the back teeth, which are called carnassals instead of molars, makes them work like a pair of scissors, for cutting pieces of meat. The jaw is not capable of moving side-to-side, like ours. This helps keep the carnassal teeth in alingment for cutting. The rest of the teeth are conical, and designed for cutting and tearing. Lions, like all cats, do not chew their food, but swallow it in chunks. (This lioness is 'Sierra' at the Sierra Safari Zoo in Reno, NV.) They also use only one side of their mouth at a time. This trait is also common to all cats, and is caused by the inability of the jaw to move side-to-side. The tongue is covered with rough spines, called papialle. This helps the lion scrape meat off of bones, and acts like a comb for grooming.\nThe digestive system of the lion is simple, not unlike a human's. Meat is fairly easy to digest, and the elaborate digestive mechanisms present in their prey for breaking down celluose are not needed. Cats, in general have the shortest digestive tracts of all animals.\nA lion's body temperature ranges from 100.5 to 102.5 degrees farenheit. (38.05 - 39.16 degrees C.)\nNo physical description of the lion would be complete without some mention being made about it's magnificent roar. Only four cats can roar: The lion, tiger, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats have been assigned to the genus Panthera because they can roar. Of these cats, the lion roars the most. It is beleived the roar serves to alert other lions of an individual's presence. Roaring choruses of several lions, or a whole pride, also take place. When a lion roars, it can do so with enough force to raise a cloud of dust. Roaring is made possible by a special two-piece hyoid bone in the throat. All of the non-roaring cats have a one-piece hyoid bone. It is said that a lion's roar can be heard 5 miles (8 km) away.\nLife Cycle\nLion cubs are born blind, in litters of two to four. (Litters up to nine have been reported, but chances of more than four survivng are low, because the mother has just four teats.) They are typically about 1 foot (30.5 cm.) long and weigh about a pound (.45 Kg.). The cubs are completely covered with fur at birth, and may carry some spots while they are young. The eyes open in about 2-3 weeks, but they probably don't function for about a week after they open. The milk teeth appear about three weeks after birth, and the cubs are ready for solid food about a week later. Interestingly enough, wild lion mothers often do not wean their cubs until they are 2-3 months old.\nThe mother lion keeps her cubs by themselves for the first few weeks, but then introduces them to the pride. Once introduced, cubs may suckle any lactating female. This helps bond the cubs to the adults, and promotes survival. The mother carries the young cubs around by the scruff of their necks when it becomes necessary to move them.\nCub mortality is extremely high, with only one in eight surviving to adulthood. (Survival prospects are excellent after that.) There is a number of reasons for this. First of all, teething is painful, and weakens the cub so that many die during teething. Mother lions can become absorbed by some activity, and will forget for a while that they have cubs to care for. A new male taking over a pride will kill all of the cubs, so that the pride contains only cubs of his siring. Finally, cubs are at the bottom of the feeding hirearchy, and only get food when the adults are filled. Indeed, many cubs starve to death when food is scarce. An interesting exception to this is that male lions will frequently let the cubs share his food, while the females make the cubs wait their turn.\nYoung cubs spend much of thier waking time playing, and practicing the survival skills they will need as adults. Just before they are a year old, they will join their parents in the hunt. Before the cubs have reached the age of two, they can bring down prey as large as a gazelle by themselves. At age two, lions become sexually mature, and males start to grow manes. The appearance of the mane causes the young males to be driven out of the pride. Females usually stay with the pride for their entire life, although some are known to live alone.\nSingle males, often called nomadic males, often live on their own for many years. Frequently, two or more males, often brothers, will form an association, and hunt together, often for the rest of their lives. This association probably results from the advantages of hunting together when young, and freshly kicked out of the pride. These groups of powerful males will often take on game that females tend to leave alone. Attacks on giraffe by male groups is not unknown. It is also commonm for these male associations to take over a pride as a group.\nFemales go through a sort of 'trial' when they reach adulthood, to see if they can stand up to the other adult females. This takes the form of harrasment at kills, minor fights, etc. Those who can take the harrasment of the other females are ultimately accepted into the pride. Those that are intimidated, and run away when harrased, become nomads. Lionesses accepted into the pride are members for life, and are still welcome even when age or injury makes them less effective hunters.\nPride Life\nA pride of lions is a family structure. It consists typically of 4-20 females with their cubs, and typically, two or three males. The number of males in a pride can very from one to as many as seven. It is being found that two or males in the pride is the best situation for long-term survival. Two or more males will have more success in staving off takeover attempts by other males. Although a single male may only be able to hold a pride for an average of 18 months (With a lion generation being about 22 months), a group of several males may succeed in holding a pride for several years.\nAll of the females in a pride will be related to one another, and the young cubs are usually of the pride male(s).\nMale(s) who wish to take over a pride will challenge the male(s) in control. One form this sometimes takes is a 'stare-down', where two males will sit a few feet apart, face-to-face, and stare at each other. The first one to break his stare is the 'loser'. This can go on for many hours. Eventually, most pride control power struggles end in some form of physical confrontation. Fights to the death occur occasionally, and many a male in his prime has fallen acquiring or defending a pride. Surviving losers often become nomads, and have to fend for themselves. They tend to lose weight, and scavenge more than they hunt as they grow older. However, it is not unknown for another lion to share their food with one of these old nomads. It is interesting to note that females outnumber males by a substantial margin in wild lion populations, even though the birth ratio is about 50 percent male/female. This is probably due to the tendency of males to be nomads, take on more dangerous game, and be killed in pride takeover attempts. Elderly males are often killed by other predators.\nLions of both sexes will rub each other in greeting. This rubbing can be quite vigorous and forceful. Males will sometimes knock each other over when they rub. One person who raises lions suffered 2 broken ribs from a particularly intense rub she recieved (in affection, of course!). This rubbing serves a purpose. There are scent glands on the corners of the mouth. Rubbing deposits this scent on the other lion. This scent is kind of like a mark of bonding or ownership, and the other lion will relish this mark. This behavior is common to all felines, and your house cat does this too, when it rubs you. Male lions will also spray other lions as a means of enhancing bonding.\nIn a pride, the females do most of the hunting. It is often observed that the male will eat first, and then the females. This way, the males get big and strong. They also get somewhat clumsy, and this, combined with a big mane, makes them less-adept hunters. Although the pride male can, by virtue of his size, easily dispatch a prey animal the females are struggling with, he relies on the females for a lot of his food.\nDespite their size and clumsiness, male lions are still formidible hunters. When patrolling the territory, they will often hunt for themselves.\nIn return for 'the lion's share', the male is responsible for marking a pride's territory. He does this by spraying a scent from a gland on his anus, on vegetation. He can also mark his territory by scratching marks on trees. (These also serve to sharpen the claws, and clean out any bits of meat caught on them.) The male also defends his territory, and of course, provides the pride's 'stud service'. It is unusual for a male to have control of a pride, if he is beyond the age of ten years.\nResearchers have recently found small populations of lions with a markedly different pride structure than what is found on the African plains. These lions have been found in very desolate country along the upper Nile river. In these prides, the roles of the males and females are reversed. the males do most of the hunting, with Cape buffalo being their usual prey. The lionesses mainly stay at home with the cubs. Often, a pride will live in a cave. The researchers who discovered this theorize that this may be typical of the lion that lived in the holy lands, and may explain some of the untypical traits of the lion mentioned in biblical texts. More research is being done in this area.\nHunting\nLions are social animals. By hunting together, they can go after bigger game. Bigger game means more food for everyone. (Lions don't think about ecological advantages, they just like to eat!) The typical prey animal that is taken by lions is in the 250 pound (112.5 Kg.) range, but much larger game (Such as buffalo) is hunted when conditions permit. (In the SavutiNational Park in Botswana, adult elephants and hippos are occasionally taken.) Prey species more commonly taken include zebra, wildebeest, gazelles, antelope and waterbuck. Lions will also hunt smaller animals, when they are hungry and nothing bigger is available. Even crocodiles are occasionally hunted.\nLions are also expert scavengers, and obtain as much as 40 percent of their food by stealing it from other predators, or finding already dead animals.\nAlthough they are the largest, lions are by no means the best hunters in their ecosystem. (Cheetahs are probably the best.) They do not do simple things that solitary predators tend to do, like keep the wind before them. Instead, lions survive because there is so much food available around them, and they tend to hunt in groups. Even their impact on prey populations is smaller than might be suspected. About one in fifteen of any given popular prey animal will become a lion meal in a given year. This isn't even enough to significantly control population growth! On average, a single lion will kill 15-20 large herbivores a year.\nHunting is done most frequently in the evening, or early morning. Much hunting is also done at night. The moonless part of the night is preferred for hunting. Less hunting is done during the day, due to the heat, and better chances of being spotted by the prey. Lions do hunt during the day, and their best statistical chance of a single animal making a kill is when they stumble across a lone prey animal who is caught by surprise.\nGroup hunting methods are ruthless and scientific. The younger members of a pride will often 'drive' a herd of prey animals towards the more experienced hunters who are waiting in ambush. Sometimes, one or more lions will wait in ambush at a waterhole, and jump on unsuspecting animals coming for a drink. In any case, the hunts are surprisingly well organized.\nOnce a lion has selected an animal to attack, it will sprint to it and attempt to grab hold of it. Lions are not endurance runners, and need to be fairly close to their faster quarries. Often several individuals will assist in making the kill. Making a kill is generally done in two stages: first, bring the animal down, then actaully kill it. In most cases, this process starts by a lion jumping onto the back of the selected prey animal, and working it's way towards the neck. It will use it's needle-sharp claws to hold onto the animal while doing this. Many animals who are sucessful in escaping being killed will undoubtedly later die from the severe lacerations inflicted by the sharp claws.\nThe most frequently used killing method is suffocation. A single lion will often get a good bite on it's victim's throat, and crush the windpipe. Especially when killing large prey, one lion of a group will clamp it's mouth over it's victim's nose and mouth while the other lions hold it down. It is not unusual for the other lions to open the abdomen and begin eating while the animal is still being suffocated. In fact, this often kills the animal faster than the suffocation does. (Interestingly enough, the victim rarely struggles after it is brought down. This is probably due to the shock of being caught, and suggests that they may not be suffering as much as you might be led to beleive. Some people also believe that lions are capable of 'projecting a thought' into the prey to help it suffer less.) Sometimes, a large group of hungry lions will so completely immobilize an animal that they just simply tear it apart. Although it may seem that lions sometimes try to 'humanely' dispatch their prey, the real reason they like fast kills is that they can start eating sooner.\nA variety of other techniques are occasionally used to make the kill. A well-placed swat with their massive paws can also instantly immobilize an aninimal by doing considerable internal damage. Very small prey is killed by simply biting through it. A more spectacular killing method, often seen on nature shows, involves leaping on the prey's back and biting the back of the neck. The big canine teeth slip between the vertabrae and break the spinal cord. Death is immediate. A few observers have recorded lions hooking their paws around the neck in such a way as to immobilize the head while flipping the body over. This breaks the neck, and kills the prey, although few if any broken necks have actually been observed.\nAs soon as the prey is dead, a single lion will often drag it's catch to a less open spot. The abdomen is opened, and the meal usually starts with the entrails. Lions vary widely in their tastes, which tend to vary on a region by region basis. Almost all lions eat the heart, liver and kidneys. Some lions will often then bury the stomach and intestines, but frequently just make an attempt at doing this. Why they do this is unknown. Other lions will eat everything in the body cavity except the stomach, showing a strong preference for the intestines. The meal then proceeds with the hindquarters, which is the fleshiest part of the animal. The lions will then work forwards towards the head. It is also unusual for lions to open the skull. Individuals in a group of lions feeding will go for whatever they can get their teeth into, with the strongest individuals getting the best morsels. If the pride male is present, he will often (but not always) hog the kill for himself, until he is sated. The females eat next, and then, the cubs. In some locales, the males prefer the flesh and will start eating the hindquarters of a fresh kill while the females fight over the entrails.\nLions have poor table manners and will often fight over their food. But, when it's all over, they will lick each others' wounds. Imagine getting wounded just trying to eat dinner!\nUnlike most other cats, lions prefer to eat crouching or lying down.\nJust because a lion suceeds in making a kill dosen't always mean it gets to eat it. Frequently, other predators, especially hyenas, will pester a lion to the point where he will abandon a kill to them. Smaller predators aren't as sucessful, but often grab scraps when the lion isn't looking. This works in reverse, too. Often one or more lions will scare another predator off of it's kill.\nLions are scavengers, too. They will eat most anything they find dead. For many old males too old to run down live game, scavenging may be their only way to find food.\nA lion will gorge itself, if possible, on a kill. An adult will typically eat 40 pounds (18 Kg.) of meat at a time, with reports of as much as 75 pounds (34 Kg.) consumed in one sitting. A single lion may take two or more meals from a kill over a 2-3 day period, while prides usually cannot get more than one meal for everybody after an average kill. After eating a large meal, lions will sleep for as long as 24 hours (what a life!). A good, full meal for a pride may result in four days of little activity, and no great desire to hunt until the sixth day.\nA lion can hold a posture that tells the prey animals around it that it is not hunting. The lion will then be able to pass by without causing much more than unusual caution.\nReproduction\nLions become sexually mature around the age of two to three years. At this time, the males go off in search of a pride of their own. The females generally become the breeding stock for the next generation of the pride. However, some females will wander out of the pride (Or be kicked out in rare cases) and become nomads. Nomadic lions will mate, and even raise families.\nMating among lions is not much different from that of any other cat. A female lion can come into heat at any time, although there tend to be peak periods for mating in different parts of Africa. A female will be in estrus for 4-8 days. If no pregnancy results, the estrus cycle will repeat in about 90 days or so. During mating, the male and female are together constantly, and they usually do not eat.\nThe mating begins with growling, pawing and even biting. When the female is finally in the mood, she lies down, and the male mounts her. Actual copulation takes 6-10 seconds, after which time the male gently bites the female's neck. The female then turns and bares her teeth at the male. The cycle repeats itself, maybe every 20 minutes, and a pair of lions can mate 40 times in a day! It is also known that a female may mate with more than one male during her estrus. The result is her cubs may have different fathers.\nMale cats have spines on their penis that point backwards. The purpose of these spines is to cause slight trauma to the female's vagina upon withdrawal of the penis. The resulting pain triggers ovulation. It may also help explain why the female turns and bares her teeth at the male at the end of mating. The penis is also very mobile, and can be pointed backwards for spraying. In fact, I have observed the penis pointed backwards most of the time on one lion, and this may be the normal condition. Lions can also move their penis from side to side while spraying, to catch something a bit off-center (I have been sprayed this way).\nFemale lions are also capable of synchronous breeding. Especially if a new set of males has just taken over a pride and killed all the cubs, the females will come into heat all at once. This serves to shorten the reproductive cycle for the first generation of new cubs.\nLions and Humans\nThe relationship between man and the lion have not always been a good one. Even to this day, lions are still shot as vermin in some parts of Africa. Until recently, lion populations in general were healthy in most of their present range, with numbers in the 30-40,000's. Poaching, and habitat destruction have taken their toll on the lion, but the biggest problem today appears to be disease. Diseases such as canine distemper, tuburcelosis, and FIV (feline equivalent of HIV) and even HIV have decimated lion populations in the last several years. South Africa is espercially hard-hit, with dramatic population losses in the Kruger National Park area. Population estimates for wild lions now number 18-24,000.\nA small population of lions lives in the Gir Forest Sanctuary of India. This population of lions has come back from a very low number to about 350 animals. Very recently, a new sanctuary has been declared for the lion in this area, giving them more room to spread out without causing conflicts with humans. Suprisingly, certain tribes of people coexist more or less peacefully with the lion in these sanctuaries. Still, the Asiatic lion is highly endangered.\nAnother factor that has led to severe losses in lion population in some areas is hunting. It has always been the norm for hunters to take male lions. When a pride male is killed, new males take over the pride and kill the cubs. This effectively stops the pride from producing new adults for 18 months to two years. Also, the tendency to select bigger-maned lion while hunting has resulted in an overall decrease in mane size among wild lions. As a result of these factors, many countries in Africa have banned lion hunting, or severely restricted it.\nThe lion is the only big cat that is not considered an endangered species (Asiatic lion excepted). It is listed in CITES appendix II as a 'threatened species'. This means that there are some restrictions in international trade of lions and their parts. But with the current sharp decrease in lion populations, endangered status is probably not far down the road.\nHere is a list of commonly recognized lion subspecies, living or extinct:\nAngola Lion ( P.l. bleyenberghi ) - Zimbabwe, Angola and Zaire\n) - Zimbabwe, Angola and Zaire Asiatic Lion ( P.l. persica ) - Gir forest sanctuary of NW India\n) - Gir forest sanctuary of NW India Barbary Lion ( P.l. leo ) - Extinct 1920, but it is suspected more and more that they may exist in captivity in America and Africa.\n) - Extinct 1920, but it is suspected more and more that they may exist in captivity in America and Africa.

Masai Lion ( P.l. massaicus ) - Eastern Africa (Notably Kenya and Tanzania)\n) - Eastern Africa (Notably Kenya and Tanzania) Senegalese Lion ( P.l. senegalensis ) - Western Africa\n) - Western Africa Transvaal or South African Lion (P.l. kruegri) - Botswana, Nambia, and South Africa. (The white Lions of Timbavati included here.)\nSubspeciation in lions is a subject of much debate. It is looking more and more like there are two, perhaps three subspecies of lions instead of the seven mentioned above. The Barbary Lion Reintroduction Program has been studying the genetics of lions off and on now for some years. They have yet to be sucessful in finding a genetic marker for the Barbary lion. In the end, it may be that we will identify Barbary lions (or any other lion 'subspecies') by their phenotypic (appearance) traits.\nLuckily, many African nations have set aside large game reserves for thier most important national treasure- their wildlife. This, of course, includes lions. These parks bring thousands of tourists, and hard foreign cash with them, each year. But, pressure from farmers may erode the areas in some of these parks. Poachers have killed much wildlife in recent years, and some parks have experienced all-out 'wars' between rangers, poachers, and even local native tribes. Man's intervention in natural ecosystems can also cause serious problems. In 1994, canine distemper- introduced accidently by man- wiped out a third of the Serengeti's lions. Although this epidemic is now under control, the damage has been done. Luckily, lions have a lot of reproductive potential, and numbers should return to normal within a generation or two. (More information about the canine distemper epidemic can be found on the lion links sectoin of this webpage.) In South Africa, Tubercelosis is now wiping out out many lions. Unlike canine distemper, Tubercelosis can be carried naturally in some lion prey species (Namely Cape Buffalo) and will be much harder to control.\nIndia has a small population of the Asiatic lion. The 250 or so members of this group are all that remain of the lions that once roamed all of the Middle East and Asia. These lions are more tolerant of man than their Afircan counterparts. That makes them easy to study. But at the same time, they get into trouble when they wander into town. Just imagine finding a lion going through your garbage can! Asiatic lions are a bit smaller than their African counterparts, and the males tend to have scruffier manes.\nIn South Africa, the value of their wildlife is now being recognized by businesspeople. Many large (50,000 acres or more) reserves for lions and other animals have been set up all over the country, and many smaller ones exist as well. Some of these private reserves run lion conservation breeding programs and seek to strengthen the bloodlines of captive lions. Some of the unneeded animals are then turned loose on these large reserves and hunted (not to be confused with so-called 'canned hunting', which the operators of thes reserves hate) by hunters who pay a large price for the privelige. This gives the lion a fair chance (A lion typically lives from six months to two years in the 'wild' before being sucessfully hunted.), and gives the hunter a challenge identical to hunting a truly wild lion. And, since the population of the lions is controlled by other means, this kind of hunting does not cause the kind of reproductiove problems that hunting wild lions does. The proceeds from the hunting are then funneled back into the breeding program, and it becomes self-sustaining. At least one of these programs is now big enough where it can supply quality lion genetic materials (semen, etc.) to breeders all over the world. In fact the game reserve programs in South Africa are now so sucessful that there are now more lions in private reserves in Africa than there are living in the wild.\nZoos are more and more becoming a safe holdout for predators. Far from the caged showcases they used to be, modern zoos seek to preserve and strengthen the bloodlines of the animals they care for. Many zoos try to keep their animals on tracts of land that resemble their natural habitat. Indeed, there are far more siberian tigers in zoos than now exist in the wild! (There is a long ways to go with lions, though, in terms of building population reserves of known bloodlines. Unfortunately, some of the efforts by the largest zoos has been nearly self-defeating due to an overbearing requirements for 'subspecies purity'-- they have taken it too far the other direction.) The day may come when we will rebuild natural populations from zoo animals. (Land has already been obtained for a place to bring back the Barbary lion as soon as it is agreed on what is a 'Barbary lion', and suitable numbers of them have been bred in captivity.) Work by people like the Adamsons (of 'Born Free' fame) will help us to more easily accomplish this difficult task. The sad truth, however, is that suitable habitat for the African lion is disappearing, and we may someday only have captive lions. (So, now is the time to learn how to properly care for them in captivity.)\nAnother emerging resource in the battle to preserve the lion for posterity is the private amimal owner. Although certainly not commonplace, there are quite a number of private individuals who raise big cats for a variety of purposes. Their expertise often exceeds that of large zoos. In fact, a substantial portion of the lions captive genetic potential lies among these people, and the day must come when the large and the small facilities join together in preserving the captive genetic diversity of the African lion. One problem with private ownership is that there are occasional situations where a lion or other big cat is abused, or is improperly caged, allowed to escape, injures or kills someone, etc. It needs to be recognized that this is not the rule with these people, but the exception. Unfortunately, animals rights groups and the media tens to blow incidents involving big cats way out of proportion in their goal to either ban ownership of all animals, or to sell newspapers. The damage that is being done to responsible owners by these actions must be recognized and stopped.\nAs a result of the aforementioned actions by the media and animal rights groups, a wave of legislation is being introduced in this country to ban private ownership of lions and other large felines. Unfortunately, the important message of the role that responsible private lion owners play is not being heard by legislators. This may mean that the biggest threat to captive lions populations in this country might actually be a legal one.\nMore information on zoos and private lion owners can be found on the lion links section of this webpage.\nIn Conclusion\nIf you want to learn more, see the refrences cited on the Books on Lions and the Videos on Lions section of the 'King of Beasts' home page. Also, check out some of the other lion sites on the internet listed on the lion links page. There are even some software packages available to teach you about lions and their world. These can be found on the Software on lions page. I obtained most of the information for this tutorial from the sources listed on these sites.\nIf you have found this tutorial useful, please email me at the address below. Although I am by no means an expert, I will try to answer any questions you may have about lions. If you have any suggestions on how this tutorial could be improved, or if you find inaccurate data, I would also appreciate knowing about it. -Tim Stoffel\nSend mail, comments, material contributions, flames, etc. to:\nTim Stoffel\ntim@lionlamb.us"}

It symbolizes strength and can be regarded as a high-profile \u201ccelebrity\u201d in the animal kingdom. Today, we bring you some of the most interesting lion facts that you may never have come across.\n20 Intriguing Facts About Lions\nLion Facts \u2013 Characteristics\n1 \u2013 Lions are one of the largest of the \u2018big cats\u2019 at approximately four-foot high, over seven-foot long and up to 500 lbs in weight. Most tend to be a tawny yellow-brown in colour all over, although black manes and tail tufts are not unusual.\n2 \u2013 The great mane around a lion\u2019s head is unique to the lion, and only appears on mature males \u2013 young males look rather scruffy as the mane starts to grow in!\n3 \u2013 One genetic anomaly has produced a white African lion \u2013 not albinoism, but an actual gene that changes the body colour.\n4 \u2013 Originally lions could be found throughout most of the warmer countries of the world, but now there are only two populations left, a few hundred Asiatic lions in Gir, India, and the remaining African lions in the sub-Saharan region of Africa.\nLion Facts \u2013 Behavior\n5 \u2013 Unlike most big cats, lions are not usually solitary. They live in \u2018prides\u2019 that consist of several related lionesses and their cubs, some of which will be half-grown, and the two or three adult males, usually brothers or at least pride mates, who rule the territory and the pride.\n6 \u2013 Only one species of big cat purrs, and it\u2019s not the lion (that\u2019s the cheetah). All the others roar instead, keeping in contact with family members or hunting companions with sounds that can be heard as much as five miles away.\nLion Facts \u2013 Hunting\n7 \u2013 Lions are the laziest of the big cats, spending up to twenty hours a day sleeping in the shade, and the adult males are the laziest of them all, letting the lionesses do 90% of the pride\u2019s hunting.\n8 \u2013 Then, in return for \u2018protecting\u2019 the lionesses and patrolling the territory, these males take first go at the meat from the kills, which usually means the majority of it!\n9 \u2013 Although lions can hunt at any time, they go after big preys, as a coordinated pack at night \u2013 and they are always successful about 50% of the time.\n10 \u2013 Lions will kill anything, from mice and lizards for a quick snack, up to wildebeest or even young hippos and elephants, which will feed the whole pride for several meals.\n11 \u2013 Scavenging can provide more than half their diet, as they will steal kills from less powerful predators whenever they get the chance.\n12 \u2013 Lions are \u2018obligate carnivores\u2019, which means they can only really live on meat. They will drink from rivers, lakes etc if available, but can also survive on the moisture they get from their food for a while if necessary.\n13 \u2013 If a lion wins the fight with another pride male and therefore takes over a new pride, often the first thing he does is kill any cub in this pride, in order to bring the lionesses back into heat. This removes the old male\u2019s progeny and lets the new one start spreading his own genes all in one go.\n14 \u2013 When a lioness comes into heat, a male will become her constant companion for the next few days \u2013 during which the two will mate (a very quick procedure!) every fifteen minutes or so, meaning they can mate a total of several hundred times over those few days!\nLion Facts \u2013 The Next Generation\n15 \u2013 After a gestation period of 105 days, lionesses give birth to two or three cubs that weigh around 3 lbs each at birth.\n16 \u2013 Some lionesses are great mothers, others lose interest very quickly, but since there are usually several litters at a time and the girls allow any cub to suckle, not just their own, the neglected ones can often survive anyway.\n17 \u2013 Young lions are old enough to hunt effectively and look after themselves at about two years old; the females will usually stay with the pride, the males will leave when the mature pride males decide they are becoming a possible threat.\n18 \u2013 After a few more years of growing and maturing, at around five or six years old these males then start challenging other pride males to try to win themselves the right to mate and pass on their genes.\n19 \u2013 Average lifespan in the wild tends to be considerably less than the thirteen years a lion in captivity can expect to live, since there\u2019s nothing trying to kill them in captivity!\n20 \u2013 The only real predator of the lion is \u2013 man. Trophy hunts for the wall at home, tribal rituals of bravery or to show the kid has become a man, even just getting rid of the \u201cvermin\u201d that steal cattle, they used to be killed left, right and centre. Nowadays lions are protected by law in most places they\u2019re found, but those that kill stock will still fall afoul of the stock\u2019s owners.\nHowever, hopefully, a combination of persuading the lions to hunt wild prey instead of the easy domesticated ones and getting information to the people to tell them why they should not just kill these animals, is slowly taking effect. Keep your fingers crossed it continues that way and these magnificent creatures can be saved to roar for many more years to come."}

Unlike other big cats, however, the cougar cannot roar. Instead, the large feline purrs like a house cat.\nCougars also have similar body types to house cats, only on a larger scale. They have slender bodies and round heads with pointed ears. They vary between 1.5-2.7 m (5-9 ft.) from head to tail. While males can weigh up to 68 kg (150 lb.), females weigh less, topping out at nearly 45 kg (100 lb.).\nThe coat of the cougar is a grayish tan to reddish color with lighter parts on the underside. The tail has a black spot on the end.\nInhabiting various ecosystems from mountains to deserts to sea-level, the cougar\u2019s established range includes western North America, a small region in Florida, and most of South America. They make their home anywhere that there is shelter and prey.\nGenerally they prey on deer but also feed on smaller animals if necessary, including domestic animals and livestock. Cougars have even been known to eat insects. Skilled and cunning hunters, cougars stay hidden from their prey until they can pounce with claws out-stretched. Cougars can also climb with ease and leap over 6 m (20 ft.). After killing a large animal, a cougar hides the carcass and eats in the coming days.\nFor the most part, the cougar has no natural enemies and sits atop the food chain. However, they occasionally compete with other predators such as bears and wolves for food.\nDuring most of their lives, cougars are solitary creatures. They interact only to mate, which can happen at any time of year. Females can breed as early as 2-3 years old and give birth to 2-3 kittens at a time. They raise the young while the males return to their solitary lifestyles.\nAt around two years old, cougar offspring will leave their mother to start their own life. Some travel far to establish their own territory as cougars need a lot of room to roam.\nA healthy cougar in the wild can live to around 10 years of age. In captivity, cougars can live as long as 20 years.\nConservation Status\nCougars have been long been killed by both sport hunters and farmers protecting their livestock. Other threats to cougar populations include habitat loss and fragmentation and automobile accidents. As a result, the cougar population has significantly decreased. There are still, however, several thousand cougars in the wild, and as a result, they listed as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List.\nAlthough they once ranged widely throughout North and South America, cougars were largely wiped out from the eastern portion of the United States and Canada by European settlers in the 1700s. There is a small population in Florida, a subspecies known as the Florida panther. The Florida panther is considered to be critically endangered, and agencies are working to maintain the current population.\nFurthermore, in recent years, sightings of cougars in the northeast United States and eastern Canada have been on the rise. Although many are the result of former captive cougars who escaped or were released, there is a possibility of recolonization of cougars in the east.\nWhat You Can Do To Help\nIt is difficult to stop habitat loss or reverse its effects, but there are some ways you can help. You can help persuade your congressperson to designate the cougar as a protected animal. This legally prevents the taking or injuring of cougars, unless they pose a threat. This law has been in effect in the state of California since the approval of Proposition 117 in 1990.\nYou can also appeal to your congresspeople advocating the preservation of open land in order to maintain a livable habitat for cougars. In addition, you can donate directly to the Mountain Lion Foundation.\nCougar Distribution\nCougar Resources\nBlog Posts about the Cougar"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Interesting Facts about Cougars (Mountain Lions) - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/interesting-facts-about-cougars-mountain-lions", "text": "An impressive cat of the Americas, the cougar is known for its amazing adaptability. It has over 40 names, and despite being a skilled hunter and a member of the cat family it is usually not included with other larger cats. Read on to know about some interesting facts about the cougar.\nThe cougar is a powerful and graceful creature that belongs to the Felidae family. A native of America, it is an extremely skilled predator that can hunt on a large variety of prey, ranging from small insects and rodents to elk, deer and domestic cattle.\nCougar\u2019s grace and strength has always been admired by the native American groups. Cuzco, the city of the Incas, is reported to have been designed in the shape of a Cougar and the Incas are believed to have named their people and regions after this animal.\nCougars, also popularly known as the Mountain Lions are solitary animals that hunt during dusk and dawn. Known to be fiercely territorial, the males often engage in fierce battles.\nFacts about Cougars\nDue to its high adaptability, the cougar is the most widely distributed wild animal in America. In fact, other than human beings, no other land mammal occupies as much territory as this Mountain Lion.\nOwing to its wide range of habitat, the cougar is known by a number of names like panther, puma, yuma puma, Florida Panther, Catamount, Mountain Lion and Mountain Screamer. However, it has over 40 names in the English language. For this feat, it holds a Guinness record.\nIt is the heaviest cat in America, second only to the jaguar. Worldwide, it is the fourth heaviest cat with the other big cats like the tiger, lion and jaguar ahead in the race.\nDespite its strength and hunting skills, the cougar is often not included among the big cats. This is because it can\u2019t roar, and its physical make-up is more like smaller cats.\nCougars are extremely agile creatures. Their long hind limbs allow them to cover a distance 40 feet in a single leap. In this regard they are second only to snow leopards that are known to cover a distance of 45 feet at one go. Their large feet help them jump up cliffs that are even 18 feet high.\nThese wild cats are very territorial. They attack any one who they consider to be an intruder into their land.\nBritish Columbia is also known as the \u2018Cougar Island\u2019 because of the highest number of cougar attacks reported there.\nWhile the male is also referred to as Mountain Lion, the females are called she-Mountain Lions.\nOn an average, only one out of six cougar cubs survive to reach adulthood.\nThere is a difference in the structure of the voice box or the larynx, because of which the cougars can\u2019t roar. They produce a high pitched scream. This shrill scream has earned them a place in American folklore.\nDue to its tail that helps it maintain balance and its sleek built body. Cougars are believed to have shared their ancestry with the cheetahs. However, there is a lack of evidence to provide credence to this theory.\nCougars are solitary hunters that live in pairs during the mating season.\nThese cats are stalk and ambush predators. They first bring down their prey with their remarkable athleticism and then kill them with a lethal bite to their neck.\nIf these cats can\u2019t finish their kill at one go, they hide their meal under leaves or behind the bushes to return to it later.\nDespite their great hunting skills, these Mountain Lions are not apex predators. They are under constant threat from jaguars and bears. This stress had helped them evolve into excellent swimmers and climbers.\nA hybrid of cougar and a leopard is known as a pumapard. The hybridization was done in the late 1890s and early 1910s in Germany.\nDespite their great adaptability, the population of this magnificent animal is fast dwindling. The main reason behind this is loss of its habitat and prey. Also conflicts with human is a threat to their survival, as human beings keep pushing into their territory constantly. However, the cougar has made a comeback in the state of Wyoming where its population is the highest."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "California Sea Lion | NOAA Fisheries", "url": "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/california-sea-lion", "text": "Adult California sea lion. Credit: NOAA Fisheries\nAbout the Species\nCalifornia sea lions are \u201ceared seals\u201d native to the West Coast of North America. They live in coastal waters and on beaches, docks, buoys, and jetties. They are easily trained and intelligent and are commonly seen in zoos and aquariums. California sea lions are playful, intelligent, and very vocal (sounding like barking dogs). Like all marine mammals, they are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Their population has been increasing since at least 1975, after protections were put in place under the MMPA. NOAA Fisheries helps conserve the California sea lion through collaborative management, integrated science, partnerships, and outreach. Our scientists use innovative techniques to study, protect, and rescue California sea lions in distress\u2014for example, stranded or caught in nets. Our work helps reduce harm from human activities (such as fishing and pollution) through management based on sound science, public input, and public outreach.\nPopulation Status\nNOAA Fisheries estimates population size for the U.S. stock of California sea lions in our stock assessment report. From 1975 to 2014, the maximum population growth rate of the U.S. stock of California sea lions was 7 percent per year.\nProtected Status\nMMPA Protected Throughout Its Range\nAppearance\nAdult females and juveniles are slender-bodied and are blonde to tan in color. Adult males are generally larger than females and are mostly dark brown to black in color. Pups are dark brown at birth and weigh about 16 pounds. When pups are 4 to 5 months old, they molt their dark brown coats for light brown or silver coats. California sea lions have broad front flippers and long, narrow snouts. Subadult and adult males have pronounced forehead crests crowned with tufts of blonde or lighter hair. California sea lions have visible ear flaps, and three to five claws on their hind flippers.\nBehavior and Diet\nCalifornia sea lions feed mainly offshore in coastal areas. They eat a variety of prey\u2014such as squid, anchovies, mackerel, rockfish, and sardines\u2014found in upwelling areas. They also may take fish from commercial fishing gear, sport fishing lines, and fish passage facilities at dams and rivers. California sea lions are very social on land and in the water, but during the breeding season the males aggressively defend their territories and females fight other females to protect their pups. While on the breeding islands, California sea lions are very skittish of humans and will run into the water if they see or smell people. California sea lion males bark like dogs to communicate with other males and females. Females and pups communicate using vocalizations that are unique to the female and pup. Each pup and female has a unique scent that also identifies them. A female can locate her pup among hundreds of others by her pup\u2019s vocalization. When she finds her pup, she smells it as a final check. One common behavior\u2014called \u201crafting\u201d\u2014can make a sea lion look like it\u2019s caught in a net. A rafting sea lion holds its flippers above the water for a long time, motionless, to rest and regulate its body temperature. If you cannot see a buoy or net gear, the seal is most likely rafting.\nWhere They Live\nCalifornia sea lions live in the shallow waters of the eastern North Pacific Ocean. They prefer sandy beaches or rocky coves for breeding and haul-out sites. Along the West Coast, they also haul out on marina docks as well as jetties and buoys. California sea lions range from southeast Alaska to the Pacific coast of central Mexico. Their primary breeding range is from the Channel Islands in southern California to central Mexico. NOAA Fisheries divides the California sea lion population into three stocks (United States, western Baja California, and Gulf of California) based on the location of major rookeries and the international border. The U.S. stock waters ranges from the U.S./Mexico border to Canada. In normal years, male California sea lions migrate during the winter to feeding areas off California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Canada, and southeast Alaska but females and pups stay near the breeding colonies until the pups are weaned. In warm water (El Ni\u00f1o) years, some females are found as far north as Washington and Oregon, presumably following prey.\nWorld map providing approximate representation of the California sea lion\u2019s range.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nMales are \"polygamous,\" establishing breeding territories that may include up to 14 females. They defend their territories with aggressive physical displays and vocalization. Sea lions reach sexual maturity at 4 to 5 years old, but do not become socially mature until much older\u2014they begin holding territories at around 9 to 12 years old. Breeding season lasts from late June to early August; most pups are born from May through June. Three to four weeks after giving birth, females are ready to mate again. California sea lions separate their nursing and feeding activities. A mother sea lion nurses her pup for 1 to 2 days, then leaves the pup ashore while she travels to feeding areas at sea. She spends 2 to 5 days feeding, then returns to nurse. During the mother's absence, the pup doesn\u2019t eat. Females continue a pattern of going to sea for several days and nursing ashore for several days until they wean their pups. This takes almost a year. If you see a pup on the shore, please leave it be. If it looks to be in distress, call your local marine mammal stranding network member.\nThreats\nEntanglement One of the main threats to California sea lions is getting caught in fishing gear. They can become entangled in many different gear types, including traps, pots, or gillnets. Once entangled, they may drag and swim with attached gear for long distances, ultimately resulting in fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or severe injury, which may lead to reduced reproductive success and death. Biotoxins from Harmful Algal Blooms Under the right conditions, algae can grow out of control. Some algae \u201cblooms\u201d produce toxins that can kill fish, mammals, and birds, and may sicken or even kill humans in extreme cases. California sea lions are top predators, which means these toxins can build up in their bodies, possibly leading to seizures or death from domoic acid poisoning. Human-Caused Injuries and Mortalities California sea lions are easy to view in the wild, but this puts them at higher risk of human-related injuries and death. Feeding or trying to feed them is harmful and illegal, because it changes their natural behaviors and makes them less wary of people and vessels. They learn to associate humans with an easy meal and change their natural hunting practices\u2014for example, they take bait catch directly off fishing gear. Sometimes they fall victim to retaliation (such as shooting) by frustrated boaters and fishermen. They may also be disturbed or harassed by the presence of humans and watercraft. Harassment happens when any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance might injure them or disrupt their behaviors\u2014and it\u2019s illegal. Remember to share the shore with California sea lions, for their safety and yours.\nScientific Classification"}

While it's a big animal, the mountain lion is actually the largest small cat. It's more closely related to the domestic cat than to the lion or tiger. Puma concolor holds the Guinness World Record for the animal with the most common names. It is known as the mountain lion, cougar, puma, catamount, and about 40 other names in English. In keeping with its Linnaean name, scientists call the cat a puma.\nFast Facts: Mountain Lion Scientific Name : Puma concolor\n: Puma concolor Common Names : Mountain lion, puma, cougar, panther\n: Mountain lion, puma, cougar, panther Basic Animal Group : Mammal\n: Mammal Size : 4.9-9.0 feet\n: 4.9-9.0 feet Weight : 121-150 pounds\n: 121-150 pounds Lifespan : 8-10 years\n: 8-10 years Diet : Carnivore\n: Carnivore Habitat : The Americas\n: The Americas Population : 50,000\n: 50,000 Conservation Status: Least Concern\nDescription\nThe mountain lion is the fourth largest cat in the world after the tiger, lion, and jaguar. The cat's coat is tawny on top and lighter on the belly, leading the name \"mountain lion.\" Males and females look similar, but males tend to be larger. Males average around 7.9 feet from nose to tail tip, while females average 6.7 feet in length. In general, adults range from 4.9 to 9.0 feet long. Males weigh 117 to 220 pounds (average 150 pounds), while females weigh between 64 and 141 pounds (average 121 pounds).\nAlthough mountain lions are large, they are not considered to be big cats because they cannot roar. However, they can produce a distinctive scream known as caterwauling.\nHabitat and Distribution\nThe mountain lion has the largest range of any terrestrial American animal. It is adapted to diverse habitats from the Yukon in Canada down to the southern Andes in South America. In North America, mountain lions have been extirpated in the eastern half of the continent, with the exception of the Florida panther.\nDiet and Behavior\nLike other cats, the mountain lion is an obligate carnivore. While deer are its most important food source, the mountain lion will kill and eat anything it can catch, ranging from insects all they way up in size to moose.\nThe mountain lion is an ambush predator that stalks its prey and pounces. It uses its bite to break its victim's neck or else suffocate it. Following a successful hunt, the mountain lion drags its prey to a cache and hides it with brush. It returns to the cache to feed over the course of several days. Like most cats, mountain lions are crepuscular and tend to hunt before dawn and after dusk.\nReproduction and Offspring\nMountain lions are solitary except during mating and, for females, when caring for cubs. Although females are in estrus for 8 days of a 23-day cycle, they usually have only one litter every two or three years. After mating, the pair separates. Gestation last 91 days. The female seeks a cave or other protected space to give birth and rear her young. She most often gives birth to two cubs, although a litter may range from one to six cubs.\nThe kittens are born blind and have spotted coats. When the cats' eyes first open, they are blue. Cubs are weaned around three months of age and remain with their mother at least two years. Juveniles lose their spots around two and a half years of age. On average, one in five kittens survives to adulthood. Females become sexually mature between one and a half to three years of age. Males must establish their own territory before they can mate.\nIn the wild, the average life expectancy of a mountain lion is 8 to 10 years. The cats may live much longer in captivity. Here, the average lifespan is about 20 years, but one cat died just short of its 30th birthday.\nMountain lion kittens are spotted and have blue eyes. Jeff Wendorff / Getty Images\nHybrids\nThe mountain lion and a leopard can mate to produce a hybrid called a pumapard. Pumapards exhibit dwarfism and grow to about half the size of their parents. The hybrids have bodies of pumas, but with unusually short legs. The coat pattern is more similar to that of the leopard. The base color is tawny or gray with either brown or faded rosettes.\nConservation Status\nThe IUCN categorizes the mountain lion's conservation status as \"least concern.\" The IUCN estimates fewer than 50,000 cats remain in the breeding population and the number continues to decline.\nThreats\nMountain lions face multiple threats to their survival. Human encroachment has led to habitat loss, habitat degradation, and diminished prey availability. Breeding populations are becoming increasingly isolated and at risk of inbreeding depression. While the cat is protected in part of its range, hunting remains common in many countries, including the United States and Canada. Mountain lions are also susceptible to feline immunodeficiency virus, which may be spread by domestic cats.\nMountain Lions and Humans\nMountain lions rarely attack humans because people are not recognized as prey, but the number of attacks has been increasing. As of 2004, 88 attacks and 20 deaths had been recorded in North America since 1890. Most attacks occur when humans encroach on a cat's territory or when the feline is starving. Children are much more likely to be attacked than adults. If threatened by a mountain lion, the best defense is to fight back. Running away, standing still, or playing dead are all ineffective strategies.\nMountain lions are occasionally kept as pets, although there are cases of the cats attacking their handlers. A pet puma named Messi has a large following on YouTube.\nHealthy mountain lions usually do not view people as prey. DOUGBERRY / Getty Images\nSources"}

And what is the difference between a forest, a rain forest and a jungle?\nThe word \"forest\" basically means an area with a large density of trees. Forests can occur in low or high elevation, can be relatively dry or very rainy, and can be of basically any temperature that still supports tree growth.\nA mature forest is one that may have very large trees and many species of plants and wildlife such as tropical rain forests, or may be limited in the number of species of both trees and wildlife, such as is the case with the coniferous forests found in the very cold taiga regions of the world.\nThe term \"rain forest\" refers to a forest that receives a minimum of about 60 inches of total rainfall a year. There are two types of rainforests, temperate rainforests with moderate temperatures and even some snowfall, or tropical rainforests which occur close to the equator and rarely dip below 60 degrees.\nRain forests are characterized by having such a thick upper canopy of growth, that little sunlight reaches the ground. This means that young trees must be able to grow with limited sunlight, and it also means that the undergrowth in a rain forest is not particularly dense. It is generally easier to walk through a rain forest than a jungle.\nThe jungle is an area of forest that combines warmer temperatures and dense vegetation. The tree canopy is not as thick in a jungle as it is in a rain forest, allowing sunlight to reach more of the ground.\nVines, shrubs, grasses and moss thrive in the lower third of a jungle making it very difficult to penetrate on foot. Jungles, then, are simply warm forests that are very densely vegetated at the forest floor. And here are some of the jungle animals that live there- Jungle Animals\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nIs the lion the king of the jungle?\nThe African lion is not a jungle animal. In fact, of the 20,000 lions that still live in the wild, only 250-300 highly endangered Asiatic lions live in the Gir jungle of India. These lions are smaller than the familiar African lion which lives ion the savanna grasslands.\nA number of other big cats call the jungle their home though. Bengal tigers, leopards and jaguars all live in the jungles of three different continents and are the apex predators in those environments. The most notorious jungle animal of all these cats, the leopard, is serenely at home in the trees, and although it too calls some dusty environments home, the jungle is where the leopard really shines.\nStealthy, quiet, incredibly powerful, the leopard can hunt in the trees and is agile enough to pursue monkeys and other arboreal creatures high above the jungle floor. The leopard is also adept at lying in wait on a tree branch and then dropping silently down on unsuspecting jungle inhabitants such as goats and antelope.\nThe leopard is most well known though, for its somewhat gruesome habit of hanging its prey from the limbs of trees. It does this to protect it from scavengers, and will return to large kills several times to eat on the same tree branch, safe and comfortable beneath its green jungle canopy.\nUneasy is the jungle visitor who comes upon the carcass of a wild boar hanging in a tree. It only serves as evidence that the true \"King of the Jungle\" lurks nearby....Jungle Animals Facts\nThe Great Apes\nAll of the non-human great apes are native to African jungles except the orangutan which is native to jungles in Borneo and Sumatra. The chimpanzee and the Eastern lowland gorilla live in the least heavily forested areas, and chimps can be found ranging into savanna regions as well. Eastern mountain, and Western gorillas all live in the jungles of central Africa.\nThe orangutan lives in jungles and rain forests in Borneo and Sumatra and is the largest arboreal animal in the world. The trees are vital to their existence. They are all harshly impacted by farming and deforestation and, tragically, all the great apes are endangered species except human beings.\nThe non-human great apes are some of the few animals, along with whales and elephants, that display an understanding of self similar to our own, and they are our closest living relatives.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The more common African bush elephant roams the dusty savanna, but the forest elephant lives in remarkably dense brush of the African jungle.\nAbout 30% smaller than the typical African elephant, forest elephants rarely reach 8 feet at the shoulder but still must squeeze tight through thick underbrush on the jungle borders of the savanna. They live in smaller groups than their larger brush elephant cousins and have a different, more varied diet due to the richness of their jungle environment.\nThe forest elephant is vital to the development of the shrubs and trees in the jungle as they spend most of their days, distributing seeds while they forage for fruits. It is believed that they are the main distributor of seeds for several fruit species, and that without an active and healthy forest elephant population, conservationists believe there would be a huge impact on the environments they live in. In the typical circle of life, their dung also serves as healthy fertilizer for the jungle they call home. Forest elephants are elusive and have not been studied or photographed to anywhere near the extent that the bush elephants of the African plains have been. Much of their lives remains a mystery - Jungle Animals\na few more Jungle Animal facts\nAlthough some say there are no jungles in Australia, this may be a case of semantics with the word \"bush\" substituted for jungle, no matter, the edges of Australian rainforests, particularly along waterways would be considered a jungle environment in most cultures .\nAll the great apes except human beings are native jungle animals.\nThe majority of lions, also known as the \"King of the Jungle\" actually live in the savanna.\nThe jungle is a forest environment that has undergrowth so dense that it is hard to penetrate without cutting through it.\nThe word \"jungle\" is often used as a metaphor for any place that is unruly. - Jungle Animals"}

Young second-year males have a very scraggly appearance. Adult males out-size females by a small but significant amount. Lions are extremely powerful cats with enormous forelimbs that can break a cow\u2019s neck. Their massive build makes them largest of all cats except for the largest of the Siberian tigers.\nRange\nHistorical \u2013 Northern India, the Middle East (even Mediterranean area) and Africa.\nCurrent \u2013 Sub-Sahara to South Africa, excluding the Congo rain forest belt. A remnant population of the Asiatic subspecies is found in Northwest India, in the Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. A re-introduced population, in another protected park, is not yet established.\nColoration\nLions are tawny to yellow-cream, often with individual hairs darker at the tip. The abdomen and insides of legs are cream to white. The backs of the ears are dark brown to black, with no white \u2018follow-me\u2019 spots. The male\u2019s mane is tawny to reddish-brown or black, with variations based on family lines as well as region. The coat of immature animals has a pattern of light brown rosettes that fades as they mature, although vestiges may remain on the lower abdomen and legs of adults. Lion eyes are a golden brown.\nThe tawny coat can tend towards light (nearly white) or dark, and fully black melanistic lions (as in black leopards (Panthera pardis) or black jaguars (Panthera onca)) have been seen. These animals, much like the white tigers, seldom live long past independence from their mother, if they leave the pride, because the odd coloration may not be accepted by others, and it may also make it difficult for them to camouflage when hunting.\nDiet\nWild \u2013 Most Lion prey weighs 110-1100 lbs. Lions are opportunistic feeders (as are most predators), and are known to take rodents, hares, birds, reptiles and large insects, as well as their usual large antelope or zebra prey.\nZoo \u2013 Prepared Feline Diet with fasting one day a week. Knuckle bones on fast days.\nBehavior\nHunting may take place day or night. The lion pride is highly organized and, like most cats, they head-butt in greeting. The pride consists of 4-12 related adult females, their offspring and 1- 6 adult males. The pride may break into in groups called \u201ccompanionships\u201d within the pride\u2019s home range. These sub-prides function independently but may come together for cooperative hunts. Males do hunt, but their primary duty is to protect the pride and its territory from interloping rival males. Bigger and slower adult males seldom join female hunts. Females and sub-adult cubs do most of the cooperative hunting. When food is scarce, males eat first, then females then cubs. As many as \u00be of non-nursing cubs die of starvation before they reach 2 years of age. Because they hunt cooperatively, lions kill more healthy prey than other carnivores.\nThe fact that lions band together is a very unusual behavior for cats. Although sibling groups of other cat species will do so, lions are the only cats that regularly hunt cooperatively. The basic reason behind such behavior goes to the kind and size of animals they prey upon. Despite the cat-equipment, so perfect for dealing with prey half the size of the predator, prey as big, bigger than, or significantly bigger than the predator calls for more \u2026 more claws, more teeth, more cats.\nLions often act the scavenger rather than the hunter, and their favorite source of someone else\u2019s kill is hyenas. Spotted Hyena (Crocuta crocuta), long thought to be premier scavengers, have proven to be very efficient hunters. Hyenas and lions go back and forth with the you-steal-from-us and the we-steal-from-you activities. Which group, pride or pack, is successful at the vanquish-and-steal depends upon which group is larger at the time. Researchers have documented on-going rivalries between lions and hyenas occupying the same territory. Another favorite target for theft is cheetahs.\nAdaptation\nThe lion is a typical cat in over-all structural adaptations. Grappling-hook claws and the ability to supinate the palm make subduing prey easier. Extra-heavy bone in the skull and limbs, coupled with team hunting, allows the taking of extremely large prey. Lions, for example, can withstand a kick to the head from a zebra. Lion color blends with the dry grasses of their habitat. Male manes may deter hunting success, but, more importantly, they are a deterrent to injury. Wolf-ruffs serve the same purpose, shielding the neck of combatant males from the long canines. Most scuffles are huge amounts of sound and fury, with little serious injury. Juvenile males have very scraggly manes that take years to grow to fullness. Young males cannot afford to advertise themselves as males until they are large enough and mature enough to face reigning males in any contest of strength and endurance.\nBreeding & Growth\nFemale lions can breed several times a year, but a mother will not produce her next litter until her cubs are about 2 years old. If her entire litter dies, she will mate again soon after the death of last cub. When lactation stops, the next estrous begins. A male that displaces a \u201creigning\u201d pride-male will kill the suckling cubs. They are not his and bringing the female into estrous ensures that she will bear his offspring. Cubs are very small at birth \u2013 less than 1% of adult weight. An average litter is three or four cubs. Cubs suckle for 6 months or more, but start eating meat at about 3 months of age. The pride females rear their young together and will suckle cubs other than their own. The pride male is very tolerant of his own cubs, even allowing them to climb on him or tug on his tail.\nAnimal Facts Lifespan 10 \u2013 14 years.\nLength Males 8.5 - 10.8 feet and females 8.9 feet with a tail length of 2-3.3 feet.\nHeight Males 4 feet and females 3.6 feet.\nWeight Males 330 - 530 pounds and Females 270 - 400 pounds."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "18 Chrysopelea (Flying Snakes) Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/chrysopelea/", "text": "Chrysopelea Profile\nChrysopelea are most commonly known as the flying snake, or gliding snake. They are a genus of the family Colubridae, the largest snake family to 51% of all known living snakes.\nThere are 5 species of flying snake, which inhabit jungles, forests and woodlands of South and Southeast Asia. They can \u2018fly\u2019 from trees gliding as far as 330 feet (100 metres).\nChrysopelea Facts Overview\nHabitat: Jungles, Forests, Woodlands, Parks, Gardens Location: South & Southeast Asia. Lifespan: 10 Years Size: 2 \u2013 4 ft Weight: 450 grams \u2013 1 kg Color: Mostly green, but dependent on species, with black, red and yellow. Diet: Lizards, birds, bats, rodents, frogs. Predators: None. Top Speed: 26 \u2013 33 feet per second gliding No. of Species:\n5 Conservation Status:\nNone\nThe 5 species of flying snakes can be found in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Greater and Lesser Sundas, Maluku, the Philippines as well as in parts of China, India and Sri Lanka.\nChrysopelea are diurnal, which means they are day hunters. They are meat eating snakes, and will hunt lizards, birds, bats, frogs, and rodents.\nThere is not a lot known about these creatures in the wild, but it is believed that they rarely leave the tree canopy they inhabit. This means that you won\u2019t likely encounter one on the ground.\nThey range in size depending on the species. The smallest is about 2-feet in length with the largest reaching about 4-feet in length.\nAlthough these snakes are venomous, they have tiny, fixed rear fangs that make them harmless to humans.\nInteresting Flying Snakes Facts\n1. The flying snake doesn\u2019t really \u2018fly\u2019, they glide.\nBy using ridge scales located along its belly, this snake can climb vertically up a tree by pushing those ridges into tree bark. When one reaches the end of a branch, it will dangle itself into a J-shape bend. As it leans forward to choose a landing spot, the snake essentially flings itself off by thrusting its body up and off of the branch.\n\ufeff\nWhile sailing through the air, the snake flattens it\u2019s body to help glide, and moves in a serpentine motion to control direction and landing.\n2. Flying snakes jump from tree to tree to hunt \u2013 and keep away from predators.\nAs flying snakes hunt during the day, it is believed that they will fly from the top of one tree to a lower level of another one to hunt their prey. In addition to saving energy compared to ground travel, the gliding from tree to tree keeps the flying snake away from ground predators.\n3. Flying snakes are better gliders than many other \u2018flying\u2019 animals.\nBecause they don\u2019t have limbs, the flying snake can actually glide better than flying squirrels. Studies conducted at Virginia Tech show that flying snakes radically alter their body shape and perform an undulating dance in the air, which produces aerodynamic forces that enhance the actual gliding motion.\n4. Flying snakes are capable of traveling more than 100-metres in a single glide!\nThey can travel great distances in the air despite not having wings.\n5. Flying snakes have an internal guidance system.\nAlthough ballistics has a great deal to do with the selection of destination, thanks to being able to slither in mid-air, flying snakes can control some of the in-air attitude.\n6. Smaller snakes fly further.\nStudies conducted by the University of Chicago revealed that there is a negative correlation between snake size and gliding ability.\nApparently, the smaller the snake, the further it could travel horizontally.\n7. Science may use flying snake gliding principles in robotics.\nThe on-going research into how flying snakes maneuver in mid-air is expected to lead to technology that can produce robots designed to glide in the air from one location to another.\n8. The largest flying snake species is not a very good glider.\nThe Golden Tree Snake, also known as the Ornate Flying Snake, can grow to the length of 4-feet.\nAs a result of its size, and weight, its gliding ability is weak.\n9. One species of flying snake makes a pretty good pet.\nThe Paradise Tree Snake grows to about 3-feet in length.\nIt is known to be popular in the pet trade in Europe and oddly enough, this particular species is the best glider of the bunch.\n10. The smallest flying snake is the rarest.\nThe Twin-Barred Tree Snake \u2013 also known as the Banded Flying Snake \u2013 is the smallest species of these snakes.\nThey can grow to about 2-feet in length and are considered the rarest of the Flying Snakes.\n11. Very little is known about two species of flying snakes.\nThe Moluccan Flying Snake and Sri Lankan Flying Snake are two unusual species of flying snakes. The former is native to Indonesia, while the latter is native to Sri Lanka. Not much else is known about them.\n12. Flying snakes use their tail as landing gear.\nIf they have enough space and they land on the ground, flying snakes appear to drop their tail down first, almost like their landing gear to soften and control their landing.\n13. The glide of a flying snake is very fast.\nThe measured speed of the average flying snake in mid-air ranges from 8 to 10-metres per second.\n14. They can only glide in one specific direction.\nFlying snakes do not \u2018fly\u2019 upwards in any way.\nAs gliders, and thanks to the forces of gravity, the trip taken in the air is usually to a spot down below the launch point.\n15. The flying snake uses its head in flight.\nRather than thinking about the landing, the flying snake will rock its head back and forth which causes the rest of its body to undulate and thus gain control if the flight.\n16. Flying snakes are colourful.\nDepending on the species, flying snakes are green, black or dark grey in color. Some have yellow scales, orange or red markings and black bars.\n17. The flying snake is very different to many of its distant relatives.\nIt is slender compared to most other snakes. The slim body contributes to the snake\u2019s gliding ability.\n18. The flying snake looks pretty much like any other snake!\nJust from its appearance you would not know a flying snake from another different snake, as there are no appendages or other features that are common with creatures that have the ability to \u2018fly\u2019.\nChrysopelea Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

Their brute force, power, and agility give these animals their reputation. Lions do not fear any other creature in the wild, regardless of how big or small it is. Get to know more about these feline kings with these lion facts.\nQuick Facts Essential Facts Interesting Facts Lions can live up to 10 to 14 years. A lion\u2019s roar can be heard from 8 km away. Lions in the wild eat more than 40 kg of meat per day, while lionesses eat around 25kg. After lions eat their \u201cone big meal\u201d (40kg or more), it can survive for over one week without food. Lions can run up to 81 kmph (50 mph) for short bursts. The lion belongs to the Felidae family. Panthera leo is the scientific name of the lion. Lions first evolved 320,000 years ago. Lions are relatively \u201cshort\u201d, compared to their body size, with a deep-chested body. The lion has a rounded head and ears along with a hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. A female lion is called \u201clioness,\u201d while a baby lion is called \u201ccub.\u201d The majority of prey hunting is done by the lionesses. In contrast to other cat families, lions are very social animals. Lions live in groups called prides, of about 30 lion individuals. A fully grown adult lion can weigh more than 400 lbs or 190 kg. The largest lion ever recorded grew up to 11 feet long. An adult lioness weighs around 286 lbs or 130 kg. A pride only has up to 3 males with several females and their young. Even though they\u2019re called king of the jungle, they don\u2019t live in the jungle. They live in savannas and grasslands. Lions love to sleep at least 20 hours a day.\nTable of Contents 01 Lion Facts Infographics 02 Hercules is the biggest living lion. 03 The world's largest lion eats 13 kg of meat per day. 04 The Barbary lion once lived throughout North Africa. 05 Lions live longer in captivity. 06 Hyenas may attack an unhealthy lion. 07 Lions and hyenas compete for the same prey. 08 It takes 10 hyenas to put a lion down. 09 The cubs have a high mortality rate. 10 The king's main role is to protect the pride. 11 The lion's roar can reach 114 decibels. 12 It's not uncommon for a new king to kill the cubs. 13 Lions eat a wide variety of animals. 14 Lions have reliable night vision. 15 Lions can see in the dark eight times better than humans. 16 They can run very fast. 17 A lion can jump 3 times higher than a human. 18 They are the second-largest cat species. 19 A fight between lions and tigers would be unpredictable. 20 Almost all lions live in sub-Saharan Africa. 21 There are only less than 500 Asiatic lions left. 22 The Asiatic lion has a distinct appearance. 23 Lions are a vulnerable species. 24 Several countries have declared the lion as their national animal. 25 Lions can breed with other cats. 26 The leopon resembles a lion more than a leopard. 27 Jaglions take after jaguars more than lions. 28 The ligers are bred for a profit. 29 Male lions sleep longer than females. 30 Lions don't like dense forests. 31 Ancient Egypt used to hunt lions. 32 Lions have three types of teeth. 33 Lion teeth serve different functions. 34 A lion's paws share many similarities with a cat's paws. 35 Lion cubs are born grey. 36 A lion's mane starts to grow one year after birth. 37 Lionesses don't have manes. 38 No one can say why lions grow a mane. 39 Healthy lions have black manes. 40 A lion's tongue is full of tiny spikes. 41 Lion whiskers are specialized hairs that aid navigation. 42 The lions' black spots at the root of their whiskers are unique for each lion. 43 Lions can communicate through their tails. 44 You can tell if a lion is in a bad mood by observing its tail. 45 Cubs are born blind. 46 Lions have scent glands in certain parts of their body. 47 Their sense of smell is strong. 48 Lions also have an excellent sense of hearing. 49 Lions are hunted not just for meat but for most of its body parts. 50 White lions are critically endangered.\nLion Facts Infographics\nHercules is the biggest living lion. The Guinness World Records ranks Hercules from the US as the biggest surviving lion. Measuring 3.33 m or 10 ft long and standing 1.25 m or 4 ft and 10 in tall, Hercules towers over any other living lion. With a weight of over 900 lbs, Hercules is also the heaviest lion ever recorded.\nThe world's largest lion eats 13 kg of meat per day. The biggest living lion eats approximately 13.6 kg of meat a day, which is equivalent to the size of a toddler. Hercules has one brother named \u201cSinbad\u201d and has four nephews named \u201cSampson,\u201d \u201cOdin,\u201d \u201cYeti,\u201d and \u201cApollo.\u201d\nRead also: 28 Types of Cows and Bulls by Uses\nThe Barbary lion once lived throughout North Africa. Now extinct, the Barbary lion once lived throughout North Africa. According to the accounts of hunters from the 19th century, the Barbary lion may have been the biggest lion species to ever exist. Ranging from 600 to 660 lbs, Barbary lions dwarfed the modern lion\u2019s average weight of 400 lbs. However, there is no evidence to back up the claims of the hunters from the 19th century.\nLions live longer in captivity. The lifespan of lions in the wild ranges from 10 to 14 years. However, being kept in captivity can double or even triple their lifespan. Captive lions may reach up to 30 years of age due to the abundance of food and nutrition.\nHyenas may attack an unhealthy lion. Even though lions stand on the top of the food chain, there are still some cases where they can be the prey. An old, sick, or injured lion can be attacked and killed by healthy hyenas in their prime. Definitely one for unfortunate lion facts.\nLions and hyenas compete for the same prey. Both of them are known to wander in the same field, hunt the same prey, and scavenge for the same animal remains. Even more, these two species may even steal a meal from each other.\nIt takes 10 hyenas to put a lion down. A desperate group of hungry hyenas may attack a lion if it\u2019s alone. Normally, it would take 10 hyenas to tear down a single healthy lion at its prime, but even with those numbers, it\u2019s not a guarantee. Even a single lion can scare and fight off an entire clan of hyenas. For the lioness, it would take 5 to 6 hyenas to take her down.\nThe cubs have a high mortality rate. Defenseless lion cubs have a high mortality rate of 60 to 70%. This leaves them vulnerable to other predators such as leopards, black-backed jackals, and of course, hyenas.\nRead also: 55 Feral Tasmanian Devil Facts That Will Shock You\nThe king's main role is to protect the pride. One of the cooler lion facts is that the Lion King isn\u2019t just a Disney film. In an actual lion pride, the king holds the responsibility of protecting the lionesses and their cubs. The king shares this responsibility with other males in the pride which usually ranges from 3 to 4 males.\nThe lion's roar can reach 114 decibels. Lions usually roar very loud after sunset. A lion\u201dvoice\u201d can reach a level of 114 decibels\u200b, which is almost double the amount of the safe hearing level for humans. Generally speaking, any sound above 85 dBA would damage a human\u2019s hearing ability over time.\nIt's not uncommon for a new king to kill the cubs. It has been a custom for a new king in the lion\u2019s pride to kill all the cubs left by the old king. By doing so, it guarantees him that the future members will have his genes. Definitely one of the darker lion facts.\nLions eat a wide variety of animals. The lion\u2019s diet includes ranges throughout the savanna, from buffaloes, crocodiles, to young elephants. If needed, lions may also hunt small creatures such as mice, lizards, tortoises, and birds. Overall, this makes lions an essential predator in an area\u2019s ecology.\nLions have reliable night vision. Lions have fewer cones in their eyes, which makes them see less color. However, this structure also provides them with strong night vision. A lion\u2019s eyes have a membrane called the tapetum lucidum which focuses weak light back to the retina. Because of this feature, a lion\u2019s pupils can enlarge around 3 times bigger than the human\u2019s pupil.\nLions can see in the dark eight times better than humans. The lion\u2019s eyesight is one of its most important senses. Although it\u2019s not as good as the human\u2019s eyes during the day, they can see up to 8 times better at night. However, this does not mean that lions can see in a pitch-black environment. Instead, they take advantage of the minimal light shone by stars and the moon.\nThey can run very fast. In short bursts, lions can run as fast as 80 kmph. This speed rivals horses that can run for about 88 kmph, or as fast as an average car on a highway. However, lions can\u2019t sustain this speed for too long, as they have less stamina.\nA lion can jump 3 times higher than a human. Although lions weigh approximately 2.5 times heavier than an average human, they can jump 3 times higher than us. Moreover, tigers and lions almost have the same vertical leap which can reach more than 11 to 12 feet.\nThey are the second-largest cat species. After tigers, lions are the second biggest cat species. As mentioned above, lions can grow just nearly four feet in height while tigers can grow as much as five feet and five inches.\nA fight between lions and tigers would be unpredictable. According to experts, a fight between a lion and tiger would be almost impossible to predict. While tigers are bigger and heavier, lions have better fighting skills. All in all, it\u2019s a 50-50 chance for either species.\nAlmost all lions live in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the Gir National Park of India houses Asiatic lions, almost all lions in the world reside in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThere are only less than 500 Asiatic lions left. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species classifies India\u2019s Asiatic lions as an endangered species. Currently, the population of Asiatic lions has less than 500 individuals. Now there\u2019s one for alarming lion facts.\nRead also: 50 Chimpanzee Facts About The Great Ape\nThe Asiatic lion has a distinct appearance. The Asiatic lion\u2019s coat ranges from ruddy-tawny, heavily speckled, with buffish grey, black, or sandy, and even includes silvery sheen certain spots. Moreover, the male Asiatic lion\u2019s ears stay visible, with only a modest fur growth at the top of its head.\nLions are a vulnerable species. Even if the lions didn\u2019t make the IUCN\u2019s red list of endangered species, they are classified as vulnerable. With only around 20,000 lions left in the world, lions have been extinct in 26 African countries. Throughout history, the lion population has decreased by around 95% already.\nSeveral countries have declared the lion as their national animal. Lions are the national animals of many countries such as Luxembourg, England, Belgium, Albania, Ethiopia, Netherlands, and Singapore.\nLions can breed with other cats. On rare occasions, lions can crossbreed with other cat species such as leopards, jaguars, and tigers. When leopards and lions breed, its offspring is called leopons, while jaguar crosses rear \u201cjaglions,\u201d and tigers crosses produce \u201cligers.\u201d\nThe leopon resembles a lion more than a leopard. The leopon\u2019s face mostly resembles a lion, but its body more closely represents the leopard\u2019s. These types of crosses are displayed in captivity and rarely happen in the wild.\nJaglions take after jaguars more than lions. Jaglions only share a lion\u2019s color, but the rest of its features largely resemble a jaguar\u2019s. Generally, its physical appearance is dominated by the jaguar\u2019s form and inherits its dark-colored patches in the skin.\nRead also: 50 Clever Crow Facts About The Worlds Smartest Birds\nThe ligers are bred for a profit. Of all lion crossbreeds, ligers are the most even mix. Ligers have light brown coats reminiscent of a lion with the stripes of a tiger. Because of this perfect mix, ligers tend to be the most expensive, usually bred for business or profit.\nMale lions sleep longer than females. Male lions sleep around twenty hours per day, while lionesses in general sleep 15 to 18 hours per day. Thus, lionesses do all the \u201chard work\u201d of hunting for its pride as well as taking care of its cubs.\nLions don't like dense forests. Contrary to their title of being the King of the Jungle, lions actually stay away from dense forests with thick canopies. Instead, they prefer the open grasslands of the savannas.\nAncient Egypt used to hunt lions. Lion hunting has been a common event from ancient times. In ancient Egypt, warriors would hunt lions for the pharaohs. As a result, the lion population in North Africa nearly faced extinction by 1,100 BC.\nLions have three types of teeth. Like humans, lions have different kinds of teeth for different functions. A lion\u2019s powerful jaws come lined with incisors, canines, and carnassials or the sharpest teeth at the back of the lion\u2019s mouth.\nLion teeth serve different functions. A lion\u2019s incisors are for gripping and tearing meat, while its canines serve as the \u201cmain weapons\u201d for its prey. Meanwhile, a lion\u2019s carnassial teeth function like \u201cscissors\u201d that gnash and cut at meat.\nRead also: 30 Bobbit Worm Facts More Dangerous Than You Think\nA lion's paws share many similarities with a cat's paws. The paws of lions are extremely similar to a regular cat, though way bigger in size. Lions have five toes on its front paws and four on the back. Measurements taken from a lion\u2019s paw print can also help experts estimate how old a lion is, as well as its gender.\nLion cubs are born grey. Upon birth, lions have greyish fur with dark spots covering most of its body.\nA lion's mane starts to grow one year after birth. When males reach 1 year old, their hair starts to grow longer around their necks and chests. This stage establishes the beginning of their mane, the fur around the face, which will grow even more once they reach two years old.\nLionesses don't have manes. A lion\u2019s full mane normally grows long, extending across their belly. Sometimes it even grows to their front legs and elbows. However, the lionesses don\u2019t grow manes.\nNo one can say why lions grow a mane. Although no one can say why lions grow a mane, some researchers believe that it protects the lion\u2019s neck while fighting. It also allows them to look bigger, thus intimidating other animals.\nHealthy lions have black manes. Having a thick, dark mane indicates that a lion is well fed. It is likely that a dark-maned lion also has more testosterone and receives more attention from females. Typically, a dark mane also signifies that the lion is at its prime.\nRead also: 30 Pistol Shrimp Facts That Are More Harmless Than It Looks\nA lion's tongue is full of tiny spikes. Like other felines, a lion\u2019s tongue is lined with papillae, which gives it the texture of rough sandpaper. These papillae are tiny, sharp, backwards-facing spikes along its tongue. It helps the lion groom as it removes dirt more easily from their fur. It also helps them scrape meat from bones during meals.\nLion whiskers are specialized hairs that aid navigation. All cat species have whiskers, and lions are not exempted. The lion\u2019s whiskers are extremely sensitive organs, guiding them to feel, measure, or estimate stimuli around them.\nThe lions' black spots at the root of their whiskers are unique for each lion. All lions\u2019 whiskers have a black spot at their root. Like human fingerprints, the pattern of each spot are unique for every lion. Through these distinct marks, lion experts can tell them apart in the wild.\nLions can communicate through their tails. Lions have long tails that can reach up to one meter in length. They may use their tail anytime to lead or guide the pride through long grass. Lioness raises their tail as a sign of \u201clet\u2019s go this way\u201d for their cubs, as well as a communication tool when hunting prey.\nYou can tell if a lion is in a bad mood by observing its tail. The lion\u2019s tail also serves as a very good indicator of how they are feeling. When lions flick their tails, it can warn the pride to give them a little space because they are not in a great mood.\nCubs are born blind. Cubs usually start to open their eyes about three to four days old. Initially, its eyes have a blue-grey color, eventually fading into an orange-brown shade by the age of two to three months.\nLions have scent glands in certain parts of their body. Lions have scent glands around their cheeks, lips, whiskers, chins, in between their toes, and tails. These glands excrete an oily substance that keeps their fur healthy. Much like humans, we have glands that keep our hair greasy, showing up when we haven\u2019t used shampoo for quite some time.\nTheir sense of smell is strong. Lions identify their territories using scent deposits, which require a good sense of smell. This sense also helps lions find kills from other predators. In general, all felines have an exceptional olfactory organ on the roof of their mouth known as the Jacobson\u2019s organ.\nLions also have an excellent sense of hearing. Lions can maneuver their ears in various directions to listen to sounds in their environment. Their sense of hearing can reach over a mile away, which provides them another edge when catching prey.\nLions are hunted not just for meat but for most of its body parts. According to the people who have tasted lion meat before, lions taste like pork but with a stronger flavor. From ancient times to this day, lions are still hunted by humans for their teeth, claws, fur, bones, and other parts."}

Others were completely extinct in parts of South Africa, though they have been reintroduced in the Kruger and Kalahari Gemsbok National Parks. And still others could not be brought back. Below, we look at six types of lions that are bold, fierce, and, in most cases, in need of protection.\nThe signature mane, the predatory prowl, the ferocious roar\u2014it seems fitting to find that there is only one species of lion (Panthera leo). There are, however, several subspecies, which are unique in appearance and other particular traits. Nearly all lions are native to Sub-Saharan Africa, living everywhere except in the deserts and rainforests, aside from the Asiatic lion that lives in one small area of India.\n1 of 6 Northeast Congo Lion Laura Grier/robertharding / Getty Images The Congo lion or Northeast Congo lion (Panthera leo azandica) is also known as the Uganda lion. Not surprisingly, they are generally found in the Congo or Uganda, though they probably did not originate there. Like other lions, Northeast Congo Lions are big animals; males weigh about 420 pounds while females weigh a little less. Northeast Congo males also sport very dark manes; some are even black. What makes the Northeast Congo Lions\u2014males, females, and cubs\u2014 particularly interesting is their habit of climbing, playing, and sleeping in trees. This makes it quite different from its cousin lions, which typically nap on the ground. Ugandan sources theorize that the lions climb the trees for safety, to escape the heat of the day, to avoid annoying insects, and to have a better view of potential prey. \"Tree climbing\" Uganda lions can be found at the Queen Elizabeth National Park.\n2 of 6 Barbary Lion MikeLane45 / Getty Images The Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) was a native of the Atlas Mountains of Africa, which include parts of Morocco, Algeria, and Maghreb. Being a cold-weather animal, they developed thick, dark, long-haired manes that flowed over their shoulders. Barbary lions were called \"royal\" lions because they were owned by the royal families in Ethiopia and Morocco; they may even have been the lions that fought gladiators in ancient Rome. It is believed that Barbary lions are completely extinct in the wild, as a result of over-hunting, habitat loss, and a devastating respiratory disease. Over the last few decades, there has been talk about possibly reintroducing the Barbary lion into the wild.\n3 of 6 West African Lion Jonas Van de Voorde / Wikimedia Commons Also called Senegalese lions, West African lions (Panthera leo senegalensis), are smaller than and genetically distinct from other lions. They are also a critically endangered subspecies. About 350 west African lions live in a large UNESCO heritage site at the intersection of Burkina Faso, Niger, and Beni. Unfortunately, these lions (and lions as a species) are not as likely as other species to stick to their protected land and, as a result, they are subject to hunting. Still, conservation groups such as Panthera are working hard to ensure the safety and growth of wild West African lions.\n4 of 6 Asiatic Lion eROMAZe / Getty Images The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) is slightly smaller than African lions, and their manes are shorter and darker. They also have a fold of skin that runs along their belly\u2014a feature that African lions lack. Asiatic lions are extremely rare; there are only a few hundred in the wild. All of the remaining wild Asiatic lions live in the Gir Forest in India, a relatively small wildlife reserve.\n5 of 6 Katanga Lion Gerald Corsi / Getty Images Katanga lions (Panthera leo melanochaita) live in southern and east Africa. Sometimes called Transvaal or Cape lions, they are a unique subspecies but are very similar to other Sub-Saraharan African lions. Katanga lions were nearly wiped out as a result of trophy hunting, and they no longer exist in parts of their former range. Today, these lion populations are making a slow recovery thanks to the creation of managed reserves in places like Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe."}

They\u2019re obviously carnivores, but other questions remains. How much do lions eat, what is their favorite prey, and how often are their hunts successful? In the article below we\u2019ll answer the question \u201cwhat do lions eat\u201d and much more!\nHow Lions Hunt and How Often Are they Successful?\nA lion bringing down one of its favorite prey, a zebra Rostislav Stach/Shutterstock.com\nLions hunt in groups called prides that consist of up to a dozen females, their cubs, and no more than three males. While males are larger, females are significantly faster. For this reason, hunts on open savannas are primarily led by female lions. When male lions are hunting without a pride, they prefer denser habitats where they can surprise prey rather than open areas.\nThe group structure of lions makes them much more successful predators. In a study of 1,300 lion hunts, researchers found that lions hunting individually were successful on just 17% to 19% of hunts. However, when hunting in groups lions\u2019 success rate jumped to 30%!\nHow Much Do Lions Eat?\nA male lion feasting\nAn average human three to four pounds of food per day. If you\u2019re a 200 pound male, that mens you\u2019re eating about 2% your body weight (and probably feel pretty stuffed at the end!).\nLions can eat a lot more than people in a single sitting. Because lions will often go several days between successful hunts, they can eat up to 70 pounds (32 kilograms) in just one sitting! With prey like African buffalos weighing up to 2,000 pounds, this means lions can also gorge on large kills and feed a pride without leaving too many leftovers for hyenas and other scavengers like vultures.\nWhat Do Lions Eat?\nTwo lions getting ready for a hunt GUDKOV ANDREY/Shutterstock.com\nAfrican lions eat animals that include wart hogs, Grant\u2019s gazelles, wildebeests, and zebras.\nOne of the most comprehensive studies on what lions eat was published in Behavioral Biology in 1993. The study took place at Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and studied the diets of lions. Specifically, it studied what animals they ate at outsized rates. The study isolated four animals as primary lion prey:\nWart hogs\nGrant\u2019s gazelles\nWildebeests\nZebras\nSecond, the authors of the study analyzed why the lions preferred this prey. They found that lions preferred prey that:\nWas in small prey groups\nWithin 200 meters\nAnd in groups of the animals listed above\nA similar study was undertaken to study Asiatic lion populations and their diet. The study was published in the Journal of Zoology in 2011 and took 5 years of observation. Of 258 kills, researchers found that:\n53% were livestock and 47% wild\n31% were cattle\n28% chital\n16% buffalo\n6% wild pig\n3% nilgai\n3% goat\n2% camel\nIt\u2019s important to note that Asiatic lions live in a small area, around Gir National Forest. Due to the heavy population density of India and their limited range their livestock predation is significantly higher than you\u2019d find in lions across Africa.\nBeyond these lists, lions will eat about anything they can catch. They prefer larger prey, and in addition to the lists above will feast on deer, antelope, and giraffes. While lions will hunt giraffes, they do have a size limit! Lions generally will stay clear of the largest mammals such as elephants and rhinos once they\u2019ve grown past adolescence.\nDo Lions Eat other Predators like Hyenas and Leopards?\nA lion defending its kill from a group of hyenas Mark Sheridan-Johnson/Shutterstock.com\nHyenas are one of the few animals that will try eating a lion. While lions are not a common prey for hyenas, if a pack can find an aging male lion left alone, they will attempt to overwhelm it through sheer numbers.\nThe question is, will lions actively hunt other large predators in their range like hyenas, cheetahs, and leopards? Lions will attack and kill rival predators, but they will often leave their carcasses for scavengers. It\u2019s good to be at the top of the food chain!\nWhat Animals Do Lions Eat: A List of 15 of Their Top Prey\nTwo male lions on the hunt Blue Slate Films/Shutterstock.com\nLions primarily eat animals like:\nWart hogs\nGrant\u2019s gazelles\nWildebeests\nZebras\nCattle\nChital\nBuffalo\nWild pig\nNilgai\nGoat\nCamel\nDeer\nAntelope\nGiraffes\nBaboons\nHippopotamus (juvenile)\nWhat Do Lions Eat at the Zoo?\nLions in zoos are obviously not fed preferred pray in the wild like zebras and wildebeests. Instead, lions in zoos mostly eat horse and beef products, but could be fed a variety of meats.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Super Facts About the Wondrous Barbary Lion - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/facts-about-barbary-lion", "text": "This Barbary lion was glorified in the ancient Roman scriptures. Considered to be the link between the African and Asian lion, human intervention has wiped out this magnificent predator from the wild.\nHistory\nLions are generally classified as the Asian or the African lion. Both of them have varied physical and social characteristics. The Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) residing in Northern Africa resembled the Asian lion more than the African. Another feature that distinguished it from the rest was that it preferred to dwell in mountainous regions, and not in the savanna or open expanses and grassy plains of Africa or the heavily-protected environs of western India. It was separated from the rest of the lion population by deserts on the south, south-east, and east of the Great and Little Atlas. It was also known as the Atlas lion or the Nubian lion. The last of this species in the wild was killed in the Moroccan Atlas Mountains in 1922. Deforestation and encroachment by humans were the other major causes of its extinction from the wild.\nThis lion joined the pantheon of evil predators when it was graphically described in the writings regarding the Roman Empire as fighting the gladiators and feasting on innocent martyrs. Its extinction occurred in stages. It first became extinct in Tripoli in 1700, then in Tunisia due to hunting by Arab and French sportsmen in 1891, in Algeria due to the fact that the Government encouraged tribes to hunt them down in 1899, and finally in Morocco, due to the widespread civil war and forest brigands. Lions who have descended from this species have been captured and kept in zoos, where efforts are going on to get this species back into the wild.\nAppearance\nThe male Barbary lion commonly weighed between 500-600 lbs while the females weighed between 300-400 lbs. This is 50% more than what the African lion weighs. Its body was shorter than its Asian and African counterparts, but it could grow up to 11 feet in length. Its legs being shorter contributed to its overall muscular appearance. One distinguishing feature was that its mane extended down the chest through the front legs, through the underside of its belly, to the groin. The mane was very thick and dark. The color of the mane was one of the many variants of blonde, depending on the age, gender, and physical condition of the lion.\nHunting Technique\nIts prey included Barbary sheep, gazelle, wild boar, and the red deer. Carcasses that have been found have indicated that the main method of hunting resembled that of all other lions. It was death by strangulation, where the lion would chase down a prey and sink its teeth into the neck. Since it lived in mountainous terrain, it had a solitary existence or occasionally lived in pairs. Females raised their young until maturity \u2013 approximately 2 years -and then separated from them.\nBreeding\nMales and females only came together during the breeding season. Females started coming of age once they were around 2 years old, but did not generally conceive until 3-4 years. Males had the capacity to reproduce at 30 months, and but did not tend to produce cubs before the age of 3. Gestation period was more than 100 days (approximately 110), and the number of cubs born was between 1-6, with 3-4 being the most common. The cubs were generally-heavily spotted with very dark rosettes, and weighed approximately 3.5 pounds at birth.\nConservation\nA DNA analysis of the Asian and African lions would reveal that they are two different sub-species, but it is suspected that if such an analysis would be conducted on the Barbary lion, there would be a third sub-specie. A program called the Atlas Lion Project was started by an organization based in the UK called the WildLink International to try and save this lion. It even collaborated with Dr. Noboyuki Yamaguchi of Oxford University for the same. However, it is said that the project soon ran out of funds and had to be shut down. There is no solid evidence as to what exactly happened. However, some zoos are believed to be carefully breeding the descendants of this lion to bring it back into the wild."}

These fascinating creatures have certain adaptations that may seem strange to us, but are necessary for the animal to survive. These adaptations may be defense mechanisms that help the animal to avoid predators or they may aid the animal in obtaining food for themselves. Below are ten fascinating facts about animals that may surprise you.\nFascinating Animal Facts\n10. Frogs have ear drums on the outside of their heads. While frogs don't have an external ear as humans do, they have an inner ear, middle ear, and an outer ear drum or tympanum.\n9. Sea otters always float on their backs when they eat. These marine mammals dine on animals including mussels, sea urchins, clams, and snails, all while floating on their backs. Their extremely dense fur protects them from the cold waters as they eat.\n8. Polar bears look white, but they actually have black skin. Unlike other bears, their fur is transparent and reflects visible light. This allows polar bears, which live in the arctic tundra, to blend in with their snow covered environment.\n7. Snakes always keep their eyes open, even when they are asleep. Snakes can't close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. They do have eye scales which cover their eyes and shed when the snake sheds its skin.\n6. Crickets have ears on their front legs. Located just below the knees, their ears are among the smallest in the animal kingdom. In addition to crickets, grasshoppers and locusts also have ears on their legs.\n5. Aardvarks can hear and smell termites and ants. An aardvark uses its long tongue to reach deep into termite and ant mounds. These animals can eat tens of thousands of insects in a single night.\n4. Cobras are able to kill with a bite as soon as they are born. Baby cobra venom is just as potent as an adult cobra's venom. Their bite is dangerous because cobras can inject large amounts of venom in a single bite. Cobra venom contains a neurotoxin that affects the central nervous system and can lead to paralysis, respiratory system failure, and death.\n3. Flamingos have knees that can bend backward. Well actually, what looks like knees are really its ankles and heels. A flamingo's knees are located closer to its body and hidden under its feathers.\n2. The pistol shrimp catches its prey by surprising it with a loud banging noise made with its claws. The sound is so loud that it stuns or even kills their prey. The sound made by pistol shrimp claws can be as loud as 210 decibels, which is louder than a gunshot.\n1. Some species of Australian Flower Spiders eat their mother when food becomes limited. The mother spider sacrifices herself by encouraging her young babies to attack her, dissolve her insides, and feed on her body. Cannibalism is also seen in other spider species and most often observed in relation to sexual encounters.\nMore Fascinating Animal Facts\nCommon Animal Questions and Answers\nWhy do zebras have stripes?

But while the breadth of earthly biodiversity may be well known, the incredible things our animal counterparts can do are often hidden to humans. From furry creatures you never realized kissed to those who enjoy getting tipsy, these amazing animal facts are sure to wow even the biggest animal lovers out there.\n1 Koala fingerprints are so close to humans' that they could taint crime scenes.\nKoalas might not seem to have a lot in common with us, but if you were to take a closer look at their hands, you'd see that they have fingerprints that are just like humans'. In fact, they're so similar when it comes to the distinctive loops and arches, that in Australia, \"police feared that criminal investigations may have been hampered by koala prints,\" according to Ripley's Believe It or Not. Any koalas who want to commit crimes would be wise to do so wearing gloves.\n2 Parrots will selflessly help each other out.\nParrots may be associated with pirates, but it turns out African grey parrots are nothing like the infamously greedy, treasure-seeking criminals. Instead, researchers have discovered that the colorful birds will \"voluntarily help each other obtain food rewards\" and perform \"selfless\" acts, according to a 2020 study published in Current Biology. Study co-author Auguste von Bayern noted, \"African grey parrots were intrinsically motivated to help others, even if the other individual was not their friend, so they behaved very 'prosocially.'\"\n3 Prairie dogs kiss.\nPrairie dogs are quirky creatures for a number of reasons: They're giant rodents, they dig massive interconnected underground homes, and they kiss. While they're actually touching their front teeth in order to identify each other when they seem to be sweetly sharing a smooch, the BBC explains that scientists believe prairie dogs \"'kiss and cuddle' more when they are being watched by zoo visitors,\" because they \"appeared to enjoy the attention.\"\n4 Ghost crabs growl using teeth in their stomachs.\nCrabs may be able to intimidate other creatures with their claws, but if that's not enough, ghost crabs will growl at their enemies like a dog. However, unlike our canine friends, crabs make these fearsome noises using teeth located in their stomachs. \"There are three main teeth\u2014a medial tooth and two lateral teeth\u2014that are essentially elongated, hard (calcified) structures. They are part of the gastric mill apparatus in the stomach, where they rub against each other to grind up food,\" Jennifer Taylor, from the University of California, San Diego, told Newsweek. She and her colleagues were able to nail down the source of the noise after noticing that \"the crabs [were] 'growling' at\" them.\n5 The mantis shrimp has the world's fastest punch.\nYou might think that boxers have the most impressive jabs, hooks, and uppercuts on the planet, but it's the mantis shrimp that boasts the world's fastest punch. Traveling at about 50 mph, when a shrimp punches, its little fist of fury (which, of course, isn't a fist at all) is \"accelerating faster than a .22-caliber bullet,\" according to Science. National Geographic shared the tale of one such small smasher, explaining that \"in April 1998, an aggressive creature named Tyson smashed through the quarter-inch-thick glass wall of his cell. He was soon subdued by nervous attendants and moved to a more secure facility in Great Yarmouth. Unlike his heavyweight namesake [former professional boxer Mike Tyson], Tyson was only four inches long. But scientists have recently found that Tyson, like all his kin, can throw one of the fastest and most powerful punches in nature.\"\n6 Female lions do 90 percent of the hunting.\nWhile male lions attract their fair share of attention thanks to their impressive manes, it's the female lions who do the bulk of the work when it comes to feeding their families. \"Lionesses, not male lions, do the majority of hunting for their pride,\" according to CBS News. \"Lionesses hunt around 90 percent of the time, while the males protect their pride.\"\n7 Narwhal tusks are really an \"inside out\" tooth.\nNarwhals are unlike most other whales because they have what appears to be a giant tusk. But that's not actually a tusk at all\u2014what you're seeing is a tooth. Harvard University's Martin Nweeia told the BBC that the \"tooth is almost like a piece of skin in the sense that it has all these sensory nerve endings,\" adding that it's \"essentially built inside out.\"\n8 The world's oldest known breed of domesticated dog dates back to 329 BC.\nDogs are well known for being man's best friend, and it turns out that's a relationship that goes back longer than you might expect. According to Guinness World Records, the oldest known breed of domesticated dog goes all the way back to 329 BC. \"Saluki dogs were revered in ancient Egypt, being kept as royal pets and being mummified after death,\" they note. \"There are carvings found in Sumer (present-day southern Iraq) which represent a dog, closely resembling a saluki, which date back to 7000 BC.\"\n9 And the oldest evidence of domesticated cats dates back 9,500 years.\nCats have also been hanging around humans for thousands of years. Guinness World Records reports that we've been domesticating cats for 9,500 years. Proof of this came in 2004 when the \"bones of a cat were discovered in the neolithic village of Shillourokambos on Cyprus. The position of the cat in the ground was next to the bones of a human, whose similar state of preservation strongly suggests they were buried together.\"\n10 Puffins use twigs to scratch their bodies.\nPuffins surely have enough to be proud of with their beautiful beaks, but the seabirds also happen to be quite clever. According to a 2019 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Atlantic puffins in both Wales and Iceland were observed \"spontaneously using a small wooden stick to scratch their bodies.\" Indeed, in a video shared by Science, a little puffin can be seen picking up a tiny twig before using it to scratch an itchy spot on its belly.\n11 Bottlenose dolphins are even more right-handed than humans.\n\"Most humans (say 70 percent to 95 percent) are right-handed, a minority (say 5 percent to 30 percent) are left-handed,\" according to Scientific American. And the same holds true for bottlenose dolphins. In fact, the savvy swimmers are even more right-handed than we are. A team led by Florida's Dolphin Communication Project took a look at the feeding behavior of bottlenose dolphins and found that the animals were turning to their left side 99.44 percent of the time, which \"actually suggests a right-side bias,\" according to IFL Science. \"It places the dolphin's right side and right eye close to the ocean floor as it hunts.\"\n12 There's a kind of ant that only lives in a small area of Manhattan.\nIf you're ever in the area of \"the Broadway medians at 63rd and 76th streets\" in New York City, keep an eye on the ground for crawling critters and you might spot something rare. That's where the \"ManhattAnt\" can be found, an ant that only lives in the one small area of the city. \"It's a relative of the cornfield ant, and it looks like it's from Europe, but we can't match it up with any of the European species,\" Rob Dunn, a biology professor at North Carolina State University, told the New York Post. Dunn and his team discovered the isolated ant variety in 2012.\n13 Cows painted with zebra-like stripes can avoid being bitten by flies.\nCows have to deal with pesky flies that are beyond annoying for the docile creatures. Luckily, farmers can now protect their animals by painting them with zebra-like stripes. According to a 2019 study published in PLOS One, \"the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly lower than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes.\" IFL Science suggests this might work because \"the stripes may cause a kind of motion camouflage targeted at the insects' vision, confusing them much in the way that optical illusions \u2026 confuse us.\"ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\n14 Capuchin monkeys wash their hands and feet in urine.\nMonkeys are undeniably cute. They can also be pretty darn gross. Capuchin monkeys, for example, urinate on their hands and feet when they're feeling \"randy.\" \"We think the alpha males might use urine-washing to convey warm, fuzzy feelings to females, that their solicitation is working and that there's no need to run away,\" primatologist Kimran Miller told NBC News. \"Or they could be doing it because they're excited.\" Either way, ew!\n15 Sperm whales in the Caribbean have an accent.\nPeople who come from different areas around the world tend to speak with inflections, fluctuations, and patterns that are specific to their home regions. Apparently, the same can be said for whales. Researchers from Dalhousie University in Canada and the University of St. Andrews in the UK have found evidence that seems to show whales in the Caribbean have a different \"accent\" than whales in other oceans.\n16 Some pigs in China are the size of bears.\nIn Nanning, the capital of China's Guangxi province, a man named Pang Cong has a rather remarkable animal living on his farm: a 1,102-pound pig. That's roughly the same size as a full-grown adult male polar bear. According to Bloomberg, massive swine of that size \"can sell for more than 10,000 yuan ($1,399), over three times higher than the average monthly disposable income\" in the area.\n17 Some sharks glow in the dark.\nSharks boast some enviable\u2014and terrifying\u2014features, like their sleek design and razor-sharp teeth. And while glow-in-the-dark sharks sound like something you'd see in a sci-fi film, they're totally real, as noted in a 2019 study published in iScience. Researchers were already aware that some shark species produce a glow that only other sharks can see, but now scientists have discovered that \"previously unknown small-molecule metabolites are the cause of the green glow,\" according to CNN. This glow \"helps sharks identify each other and even fight against infection on a microbial level.\"\n18 Some snails have hairy shells.\nWhile it's not a secret that snails have shells, you probably didn't know that some actually have hairy shells. These hairs are rather handy to have, as they help a snail stick to wet surfaces like leaves.\n19 Cowbirds use secret passwords to teach their young.\nCowbirds lay their eggs in other bird species' nests, which means that the little ones eventually need to reconnect with their own kind when the time is right. And when that time comes, the young birds have a trick for figuring out who to reach out to. \"Juvenile cowbirds readily recognize and affiliate with other cowbirds. That's because they have a secret handshake or password,\" according to Science Daily. To put it more simply, they use \"a specific chatter call\" to beckon each other.\n20 Baby Tasmanian devils make life-long friendships.\nIf you have best friends who have been around since you were a child, then you have something in common with Tasmanian devils. Research has shown that Tasmanian devils form bonds when they're young that last for the rest of their lives. As Zoos Victoria's Marissa Parrott told IFL Science, \"In the wild, when baby devils leave their mums, we believe they all socialize together.\" As the website notes, \"young devils have their own dens,\" \"engage in friendly sleep-overs,\" and when given the chance, they prefer \"to share with their \u2026 original friends.\"\n21 A grizzly bear's bite is strong enough to crush a bowling ball.\nThose who find themselves in the presence of a grizzly bear will surely want to stay out of reach of this animal's super sharp claws. But they'll certainly also want to keep out of the grizzly's mouth, because these creatures \"have a bite-force of over 8,000,000 pascals,\" according to National Geographic. That means grizzly bears can literally crush a bowling ball between their jaws. Yikes!\n22 Humpback whales use bubbles to hunt.\nYou might think that a whale's massive size is the only edge they'd need when it comes to hunting in the open waters. But humpback whales actually team up to use a \"bubble-net\" technique in order to catch their prey. \"Sometimes, the whales will swim in an upward spiral and blow bubbles underwater, creating a circular 'net' of bubbles that makes it harder for fish to escape,\" Science News reports.\n23 A housefly buzzes in an F key.\nWhen you hear a housefly buzzing around your home, you might be annoyed by the persistent sound. However, the next time it happens, try to soothe yourself by noting that the airborne pest is actually buzzing in an F key. How melodious!\n24 Moray eels have a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws.\nIf you already thought that eels were kind of creepy, then this fact isn't going to make you feel any better about them. Moray eels have what's called pharyngeal jaws, which are a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws that are located in the throat and emerge to grasp prey before pulling the unfortunate meal down into the eel's gullet.\n25 Ducks can surf.\nOver in New Zealand, surfers have noticed the same thing that those who ride the waves in California have witnessed: ducks can surf. The birds do so in order to catch food or simply to move through the water quickly. Sports reporter Francis Malley spotted a female duck and her babies catching a wave and told the New Zealand Herald, \"The mother was surfing on her belly on the whitewash. I've never surfed with ducks before so this was a first.\"\n26 Slow lorises are the only venomous primates.\nThey may be cute, but their bite can kill. According to Popular Science, these adorable animals secrete toxins from a gland in the crook of their inner arms. Their bites have caused anaphylactic shock and even death in humans. Better watch out!\n27 Pigeons can do math.\nYou might think of pigeons as\u2026 not that smart. But it turns out, they're actually quite intelligent. In fact, one 2011 study published in the journal Science found that the birds are capable of doing math at the same level as monkeys. During the study, the pigeons were asked to compare nine images, each containing a different number of objects. The researchers found that the birds were able to rank the images in order of how many objects they contained. Put simply, they learned that the birds could count!\n28 Zebra stripes act as a natural bug repellant.\nCows may benefit from artificial stripes, but zebras have the real deal. One 2012 report published in the Journal of Experimental Biology suggests that zebras' black and white stripes may be an evolutionary feature to fend off harmful horsefly bites. \"A zebra-striped horse model attracts far fewer horseflies than either homogeneous black, brown, grey or white equivalents,\" the researchers wrote.\n29 Wild chimps like to drink.\nHumans aren't the only animals who enjoy a drink or two. A 2015 study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science reveals that chimpanzees in Guinea had a fondness for imbibing fermented palm sap and getting tipsy in the process.\n30 Sea otters are adept at using tools.\nWhile many scientists believe that tool use among dolphins is a relatively new phenomenon, a 2017 study published in Biology Letters suggests that otters may have been using tools for millions of years. Sea otters frequently use rocks to break open well-armored prey, such as snails.\n31 Frogs can freeze without dying.\nWhy tolerate the cold when you could just freeze yourself solid? According to Kenneth Storey, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, frogs undergo repeated freeze-thaw cycles. \"We have false springs here all the time where it gets really warm and all the snow melts and then suddenly\u2014bam\u2014the wind comes from the north and it's back down to minus 10, minus 15 [Celsius], and they're fine,\" Storey told National Geographic.\n32 Male horses have way more teeth than their female counterparts.\nMale horses have 40 to 42 permanent teeth, while females have just 36 to 40. According to the VCA Animal Hospital, the original purpose of these extra teeth was as fighting weaponry.\n33 Koalas sleep up to 22 hours a day.\nIf you thought your cat was sleepy, just wait until you hear about koalas. According to the Australian Koala Foundation, these cuties sleep between 18 and 22 hours a day. The koalas' diets require a lot of energy to digest, which is why they've got to nap so much.\n34 A group of ferrets is called a business.\nNo, it's not because they're so professional\u2014it's a modernized form of \"busyness,\" the word originally used to describe a group of these weasel-related mammals.\n35 Octopuses can taste with their arms.\nAnd yes, they are called arms, not tentacles. According to the Library of Congress, the animals can taste and grab with the suckers on their arms. Even more impressive? Octopuses are capable of moving at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour.\n36 Dolphins have names for one another.\nYou already know that dolphins are smart. But did you know that they even have their own names? One 2013 study published in PNAS found that bottlenose dolphins develop specific whistles for one another.\n37 Reindeer eyes turn blue in the winter.\nReindeers have beautiful baby blues\u2014but only in the winter! According to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, \"the eyes of Arctic reindeer change color through the seasons from gold to blue, adapting to extreme changes of light levels in their environment.\" The change in color impacts how light is reflected through the animals' retina, and improves their vision.\n38 Giraffes have black tongues.\nScientists believe that it's so they don't get sunburns while they eat. The animals' tongues are also around 20 inches long.\n39 Alligators will let manatees swim ahead of them.\nIn busy waters, manatees will nudge alligators to get in front, and alligators generally oblige.\n40 Sloths can take up to a month to completely digest a single leaf.\nEverything about life is slow for these sleepy mammals. Most sloths will only have a bowel movement once a week, and it can take them up to 30 days to completely digest a single leaf. For comparison, it takes the average human 12 to 48 hours to ingest, digest, and eliminate waste from food.\n41 Adult cats only meow at humans.\nYou probably know that cats love to talk to their humans. But did you know you're unlikely to see your feline friend interact the same way with another cat? That's because other than kittens meowing at their mothers, cats don't meow at other cats.\n42 Elephants and humans have similar self-soothing techniques.\nElephant calves will suck their trunks to comfort themselves. The babies do it for the same reason humans do (it mimics the action of suckling their mothers).\n43 Female bats give birth to babies that weigh up to a third of their weight.\nAccording to Bat Conservation International, bats give birth to babies\u2014known as pups\u2014that can weigh as much as one-third of the mother's weight. If that doesn't sound like a lot, imagine a person giving birth to a baby that weighed 40 pounds.\n44 Painted turtles survive winter by breathing through their butts.\nNot all creatures head to warmer climates when it gets cold out, and that means they need to learn to survive in chilly conditions. Painted turtles need to adapt to frozen ponds, which restrict their access to the air above the water. They do that by breathing through their butts\u2014specifically, the all-purpose orifice called the cloaca. Thanks to a process called cloacal respiration, the turtles are able to get oxygen directly from the water around them.\n45 Dogs have way fewer taste buds than humans.\nWhile you may think that Fido has the same dinnertime experience as you do, he's actually got a much different taste bud arrangement. Humans have about 9,000 taste buds, while dogs have only around 1,700. And while they can identify the same four taste sensations as people, dogs are not fond of salt.\n46 Otters have the world's thickest fur.\nThey're thought to have up to one million hairs per square inch. Their fur consists of two layers and is designed to trap a layer of air next to their skin so their skin doesn't get wet.\n47 Alligators can grow for more than 30 years.\nAccording to a 2018 study published in Copeia, alligators often haven't hit their full size until 33.\n48 A group of owls is called a parliament.\nTheir legislative powers, however, are still up for debate.\n49 Snow leopards don't roar.\nSnow leopards have less-developed vocal cords than their fellow large cats, meaning that they can't roar, but make a purr-like sound called a chuff instead. For a 2010 study published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, scientists researched why some cats have a higher-pitched meow than others. They found that it's not size that determines a kitty's call, but habitat.\n50 Axolotls can regenerate their parts.\nThe salamanders are the only vertebrates that can replace their skin, limbs, tail, jaws, and spines at any age. On the flip side, humans can regenerate lost limb buds as embryos and fingertips as young children.\n51 A group of rhinos is called a crash.\nIndividual male rhinos are referred to as bulls, and females as cows.\n52 Squirrels will adopt orphans.\nTurns out, squirrels have an intense motherly instinct. One 2010 study by researchers at the University of Guelph found that the animals will take in the orphaned pups of their late family members.\n\"Social animals, including lions and chimpanzees, are often surrounded by relatives, so it's not surprising that a female would adopt an orphaned family member because they have already spent a lot of time together,\" said lead researcher Andrew McAdam, an evolutionary biologist. \"But red squirrels live in complete isolation and are very territorial. The only time they will allow another squirrel on their territory is the one day a year when the females are ready to mate or when they are nursing their pups.\"\n53 Giant anteaters have two-foot tongues.\nAccording to National Geographic, it's the longest tongue of any known mammal.\n54 Cows have best friends.\nCows have stronger social ties than you might think. One 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Northampton found that when cows were separated from their BFFs, their heart rates increased as a sign of stress.\n55 Moths experience love at first scent.\nWhen a male moth catches a whiff of a female moth, he'll travel miles to find her\u2060\u2014based off her scent alone. According to the experts at Audobon, \"they don't know what the female sounds like, or even what she looks like. But when they smell her, boy, do they know it, and they use her seductive musk to track her down.\"\n56 Horses have distinct facial expressions.\nHorses can make 17 facial movements, which is 3 more than chimps and only 10 fewer than humans, according to a 2015 study published in PLOS One.\n57 Deer can run up to 35 miles per hour.\nYes, white-tailed deer can hit top speeds of 35 miles per hour. Think that's fast? Reindeer can run up to 50 miles per hour.\n58 An octopus has three hearts.\nOctopuses have two more hearts than you do. Two hearts are used to pump blood to their gills, while the third brings blood to the rest of their body. If that's not enough, they also have nine brains.\n59 Some worms can jump.\nCertain species of the Amynthas worm, which have recently been identified in the Midwestern United States, can jump and detach their tails when disturbed.\n60 Crocodiles can live up to 100.\nNile crocodiles can live for a full century. And they can do a lot of damage over the course of those 100 years: Approximately 200 people die every year from Nile crocodile attacks.\n61 Ravens are masters of deception.\nJust how smart are ravens? A 2002 study published in Animal Behaviour found that these tricky birds have the ability to deceive each other. The entire corvid family\u2014which includes crows, ravens, and jays\u2014is exceptionally intelligent. These birds have also been known to play pranks on one another, and to tease other animals.\n62 Rats laugh.\nWhile scientists don't exactly think they have a sense of humor, rats will make a laugh-like sound when tickled.\n63 Tigers have striped skin.\nYou might think it's just their fur, but no, tigers have striped skin. And speaking of those stripes, much like our fingerprints, they're unique to every tiger.\n64 Cats recognize their own name but choose not to respond.\nSorry, cat owners, you're not just being paranoid: Your pet does know when you're calling their name, and they're ignoring you anyway. In a 2019 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers discovered that while cats can distinguish their own name, they don't necessarily feel obligated to respond.\n65 Cows produce more milk when listening to slow music.\nCall it a moo-d. Researchers at the University of Leicester School of Psychology found that cows produced 1.54 more pints per day\u2014a 3 percent increase\u2014when they were played slow music, as opposed to more upbeat tunes.\n66 Butterflies taste with their feet.\nNot only do butterflies taste using their feet\u2014the receptors on their legs are also 200 times stronger than human taste buds. When a butterfly lands on a plant, they use these sensors to determine whether or not what they're standing on is edible.\n67 The spur-winged goose's diet makes it poisonous.\nDon't plan on eating a spur-winged goose if you happen to come across one during your travels. These birds, natives of sub-Saharan Africa, have flesh that's often poisonous to humans, thanks to their diet of blister beetles, which contain the deadly cantharidin poison.\n68 Vampire bat saliva keeps blood from clotting.\nVampire bats do more than just bite their prey\u2014they also keep the other animal's blood from clotting. Their saliva works as an anticoagulant, so that the blood can flow freely as they feed. Here's another fun fact: The protein in the anticoagulant has been nicknamed \"Draculin.\" Spooky!\n69 Wombat poop is cube-shaped.\nWombats use their droppings to warn other animals to stay off their turf. Luckily, their cube-shaped poop makes it easy to see that a spot is governed by wombats, as the little squares tend to stay put more easily than spherical droppings would.\n70 Giraffes with darker spots are more dominant.\nYou can learn a lot from the color of a giraffe's spots. According to a 2019 study in Animal Behaviour, giraffes with darker spots are more dominant than giraffes with lighter spots. And not only that: Dark-spotted giraffes also tend to be more solitary.\n71 Orcas can learn to speak dolphin.\nGroups of killer whales have their own dialects that are further influenced by the company they keep. A 2014 study published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America revealed that orcas housed with bottlenose dolphins over a long period of time were able to replicate the dolphins' language.\n72 Queen mole rats make other female mole rats infertile.\nTo ensure her dominance, the queen mole rat works to make it impossible for other female mole rats to have litters. In fact, the queen can produce a substance in her urine that renders other female mole rats infertile.\n73 Horned lizards squirt blood from their eyes.\nThe horned lizard has a pretty impressive trick for evading predators. When a horned lizard finds itself in a perilous situation, it can squirt a stream of blood from its eyes. The predator then runs off, because, well, wouldn't you?\n74 Catfish have taught themselves how to kill pigeons.\nRelax, pigeons\u2014it's not all catfish. But yes, in southwestern France, a group of European catfish have learned to kill pigeons, launching themselves out of the water to grab the sunbathing birds.\n75 Primitive crocodiles could gallop.\nIf you think crocodiles aren't frightening enough, consider this: They used to gallop. While modern-day crocodiles can move surprisingly fast, giant crocodiles during the Cretaceous period could use their legs to chase and kill dinosaurs.\nAdditional reporting by Desir\u00e9e O."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "16 Zebra Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/zebra/", "text": "Zebra Profile\nZebras (subgenus Hippotigris) are well-known for their distinctive stripes. They are members of the group Equus, which contains horses and asses.\nThere are three living species of Zebra: the Grevy\u2019s zebra (Equus grevyi), the plains zebra (Equus quagga), and the mountain zebra (Equus zebra).\nZebra Facts Overview\nHabitat: Grasslands, woodlands, savannahs, and mountainous areas. Location: Eastern and Southern Africa Lifespan: Around 25 years Size: 120 \u2013 140cm at the shoulder Weight: Grevy\u2019s zebra: 350-450kg, the Plain zebra: ~400kg, and the mountain zebra: ~280kg. Color: Black with white stripes Diet: Herbivores, mainly grass Predators: Lions, cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyenas, brown hyenas and Nile crocodiles. Top Speed: 68.4 km/h (42.5 mph) No. of Species:\n3 Conservation Status:\nGrevy\u2019s Zebra: endangered, mountain zebra: vulnerable, plains zebra: near-threatened.\nZebras are native to the continent of Africa, specifically eastern and southern parts such as Kenya and Botswana. Favoured habitats include grasslands, woodlands, savannahs, and mountainous areas.\nThey are grazers, feeding mainly on grasses. They are well evolved for this with strong front teeth to pull up the grass and large molars in the back of their mouths for grinding.\nThey are the favourite prey of lions but are also hunted by leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, brown hyenas, and Nile crocodiles.\nAccording to the IUCN only the Grevy\u2019s Zebra is endangered, while the mountain zebra is vulnerable, and the plains zebra is near threatened.\nInteresting Zebra Facts\n1. Their stripes are unique.\nZebras are iconic for their stripes, which are actually unique to each individual, like a human\u2019s fingerprint. Scientists have even developed a way to read their stripes like bar codes to be able to identify specific zebras in a heard!\n2. No one is completely sure why they have stripes.\nThere have been lots of theories, including that the stripes help confuse predators. Some theories suggest that the stripes work to keep them cooler, while others show that biting flies don\u2019t like to land on stripes. It\u2019s likely to be a combination of all these things!\n3. They are black with white stripes.\nThe age-old question of whether or not zebras are white with black stripes or black with white stripes has finally been answered with science. They are in fact black with white stripes!\n4. Different zebra species have different social structures.\nThe plains and mountain zebras stay in family groups, with a dominate male, females and their foals (baby zebras). These groups usually integrate into larger herds. However, the Grevy\u2019s Zebra lives primarily alone, or in loose herds.\n5. Plains Zebra migrate and form super herds.\nPlains zebra are known for their long migrations, moving to different areas in search of water and grass. Multiple family groups come together to form herds. Often as herds are migrating, they form \u2018super herds\u2019 with thousands of zebras. Other herd animals join in too, such as wildebeest and antelope.\n6. Plains Zebra mass migrate in Botswana twice a year.\nThey move from north to south to reach the rainy season in the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, before returning back to reach the northern deltas again as the rainy season there returns. This migration is around 300 miles and the moving herds contain up to 30,000 zebra.\n7. Plains zebra have the longest recorded migration of any African mammal.\nOne group of plains zebra was recorded migrating 500km from Namibia to Botswana, which is actually the longest land migration of any African mammal.\n8. They are well adapted for grazing and staying alert for predators.\nThey have long front teeth (incisors) which act like scissors to cut the grass at the root, while their large back teeth (molars) work to grind down the grass. They also have eyes high up on the sides of their heads. This means that as they bend down to eat grass they can still watch for lions or other predators.\n9. They bite and kick.\nZebras can actually be quite aggressive. This is usually when defending themselves from prey, defending their young or when males are fighting over a female. Their primary tactics are biting and kicking, as you can see in this video:\n10. They defend each other.\nThe social species of zebra will protect their members from predators. They have been seen forming defensive circles around injured members of their families, often biting and kicking approaching predators.\n11. The Grevys Zebra is solitary.\nUnlike the plains and mountain zebras, the Grevy\u2019s Zebra lives primarily alone in semi-arid grasslands. The males have territories which they protect from others, while females and their foals move freely between these territories.\n12. The Grevy\u2019s zebra can go 5 days without water.\nThese zebra are well-adapted to the semi-arid grasslands they live in and can go 5 days without drinking.\n13. There are two subspecies of mountain zebra.\nThere are the Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra) and Hartmann\u2019s mountain zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae). Both prefer to live in mountainous areas in Angola, Namibia, and South Africa.\n14. The mountain zebra nearly went extinct.\nIn 1930 there were as few as 100 cape mountain zebra, however thanks to conservation efforts their numbers have increased dramtically.\n15. The Quagga went extinct in the 19th century.\nThe quagga (Equus quagga quagga) was a subspecies of the plains zebra. Sadly, European colonists hunted them to extinction in the 19th century. The last one died in Amsterdam zoo in 1883.\n16. They are important culturally.\nThey are well known internationally but are also important locally. They can be seen in art going back millennia, including in rock art from roughly 20,000 years ago.\nZebra Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

It might surprise you to learn that it\u2019s been the subject of significant debate in the scientific community. In the article below we\u2019ll dig into this scientific debate, review both extinct and current lion species, and review their lower classifications. Let\u2019s dig in!\nThe Great Lion Taxonomy Debate\nLions have been the subject of a long-running taxonomy debate Blue Slate Films/Shutterstock.com\nWhen you think of great animal debates, you mind probably wanders to topics like \u201cwould a tiger or lion win in a fight\u201d long before you think about about taxonomy debates.\nYet, with lions, there has been a great taxonomy debate that has actually changed the types of lions we recognize!\nScientists have long agreed there is a single species of lions in the world today. Its scientific name is Panthera leo.\nHowever, until 2016, there were two different types (subspecies) of lions. One was the African lion (Panthera leo leo) and the other was the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica). The difference between the two was simple enough to describe, African lions lived in Africa while Asiatic lions live in Asia.\nHowever, in 2017 the taxonomy of lions was changed in a fairly dramatic way.\nDifferent Types of Lions\nCape Lion Despite its large, muscular body, the Cape lion actually rests more than 20 hours a day Lion Lives in small groups called prides!\nTypes of Lions Alive Today\nLions stalking a zebra GUDKOV ANDREY/Shutterstock.com\nIn 2017 cat taxonomy task force changed the definition around the types of lions. No longer were lions simply African or Asiatic lions.\nInstead, there are now two types of lions recognized today. The two subspecies are:\nPanthera leo leo : Includes lion populations in Asia and northern Africa countries.\n: Includes lion populations in Asia and northern Africa countries. Panthera leo melanochaita: which lives across southern Africa.\nThe dividing line between the two types of lions is Ethiopia and South Sudan. In these areas the two types of lions will often mate and intermix, making distinctions between them difficult.\nPast Types of Lions That are No Longer Recognized\nA statue of a Barbary lion in London\nIn the past 200 years several types of lions were believed to be either unique species or subspecies. Here are some types of lions that are no longer classified.\nCape Lion : The cape lion lived in the plains of South Africa and was believed to be a unique subspecies with a darker main than other types of lions. It went extinct in the wild in 1858, but there may be descendents in zoos across the world. Today, the Cape Lion is no longer recognized as a subspecies.\n: The cape lion lived in the plains of South Africa and was believed to be a unique subspecies with a darker main than other types of lions. It went extinct in the wild in 1858, but there may be descendents in zoos across the world. Today, the Cape Lion is no longer recognized as a subspecies. Barbary Lion : Barbary lions lived in North Africa and were long considered a subspecies of lion. They\u2019re also referred to as Nubian lions, atlas lions, and Berber lions. Barbary lions were actively hunted across their range and the last reported sighting was in 1956. DNA analysis has led to the conclusion Barbary lions were not a distinct subspecies.\n: Barbary lions lived in North Africa and were long considered a subspecies of lion. They\u2019re also referred to as Nubian lions, atlas lions, and Berber lions. Barbary lions were actively hunted across their range and the last reported sighting was in 1956. DNA analysis has led to the conclusion Barbary lions were not a distinct subspecies. Asiatic Lion: The Asiatic lion was long recognized as a distinct subspecies. There\u2019s a single remaining population of lions across the Asian continent that lives near Gir National Park in India. With how isolated these lions are, its easy to see why they\u2019d initially be classified as a distinct type of lion. However, once again recent DNA has revealed these lions to be extremely similar to lions across north Africa.\nLion Species: Extinct and Alive Today\nA cave lion fossil which shows the size of these massive lions!\nUp until 10,000 years ago, lions were believed to be the most widespread mammal outside of humans!\nThat\u2019s because there were species of lions that lived in both North America and across Europe\u2019s vast steppe that featured mammoths and other large mammals. Recently extinct lion species included:\nCave lion (Panthera spelaea) : The cave lion hunted from Europe across to Alaska on the Eurasian steppe. The species went extinct around 12,000 years ago when other species such as mammoths and Woolly rhinoceroses. Researchers that studied cave lion skeletons estimate they would have weighed up to 747 pounds, which makes them larger than the largest lion on record today.\n: The cave lion hunted from Europe across to Alaska on the Eurasian steppe. The species went extinct around 12,000 years ago when other species such as mammoths and Woolly rhinoceroses. Researchers that studied cave lion skeletons estimate they would have weighed up to 747 pounds, which makes them larger than the largest lion on record today. American lion (Panthera atrox): The American lion lived across modern day Mexico and the United States. The species went extinct at roughly the same time as the cave lion, about 12,000 years ago. American lions were notable for their size, estimates place their weight up to 930 pounds! That makes American lions the largest lion species on record.\nAs noted earlier, just a single lion species (Panthera leo) survives today. While lions are limited to small patches of savannas across Africa and a single national park in India today, tens of thousands of years ago they roamed the majority of land on Earth!\nLion Lower Classifications\nA lion brings down a zebra Rostislav Stach/Shutterstock.com\nReading about lions you might see references to types of lions such as the transvaal lion, Congo lion, or West African lion. These are often called subspecies of lions.\nFrom a classification standpoint, this is incorrect. References to these lions are what\u2019s referred to as subpopulations or clades. Commonly cited subpopulations of lions include:\nWestern Africa subpopulation (often called Western African lion)\nNorth African/Asian subpopulation (often called Barbary and Asiatic lions)\nCentral African subpopulation (often called the Congo lion)\nSouthwest Africa subpopulation (often called the Katanga lion)\nEastern and Southern Africa subpopulation (often called Cape lion, Transvaal, and East African lions)\nThe correct lower classification for lions is Panthera leo leo for lions in West Africa, Central Africa, North Africa, and Asian subpopulations. The other type of lion is Panthera leo melanochaita , which is lions from Southwest Africa and Eastern and Southern Africa subpopulations.\nLion Family\nThe family lions belong to is Felidae, or cats. There are 41 species across this family that includes tigers, mountain lions, and bobcats. Lions belong to the subfamily Pantherinae which includes tigers, jaguars, leopards, clouded leopards, and snow leopards.\nLion Genus\nLions belong to the genus Panthera. The genus includes tigers, leopards, jaguars, and snow leopards. Other large cats such as mountain lions and cheetahs are not part of Panthera, but rather belong to a different subfamily than lions."}

Despite this, the males eat first.\nThese majestic cats are threatened by habitat loss. The lion is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\nThe lion was once found throughout Africa, Asia and Europe but now exists only in Africa with one exception. The last remaining Asiatic lions are found in Sasan-Gir National Park in India, which was primarily created to protect the species. Currently, there are approximately 350-400 lions in the park.\nA lion\u2019s roar can be heard from as far as 5 miles away.\nA lion can run for short distances at 50 mph and leap as far as 36 feet.\nEven though the lion is sometimes referred to as the \u201cking of the jungle,\u201d it actually only lives in grasslands and plains. The expression may have come from an incorrect association between Africa and jungles or may refer to a less literal meaning of the word jungle.\nA good gauge of a male lion\u2019s age is the darkness of his mane. The darker the mane, the older the lion.\nA lion\u2019s heels don\u2019t touch the ground when it walks.\nLions enjoy relaxing and lazing around. They spend between 16 and 20 hours each day resting and sleeping. They have few sweat glands so they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the day and become more active at night when it is cooler.\nLions have terrific night vision. They are 6 times more sensitive to light than humans. This gives them a distinct advantage over some prey species when hunting at night.\nLionesses are caring mothers who will even take care of a neglected cub, allowing him/her to suckle and giving them a chance to survive. Two or more lionesses in a group tend to give birth around the same time, and the cubs are raised together. Cubs are extremely playful.\nLions communicate through a range of behaviors and their expressive movements are very highly developed. They will perform peaceful tactile actions such as licking each other and rubbing heads. Head rubbing, or nuzzling, is a common greeting behaviour for lions. They also communicate through a variety of vocalisations including purrs, snarls, miaws and hissing. Their vocalisations also vary in intensity and pitch.\nFacts courtesy of World Wild Life & One Kind"}

Top Speed: 35 Kph (22 Mph) Swimming No. of Species:\n14 Conservation Status:\n4 Species Endangered: Orinoco, Philippine, Cuban, Siamese 2 Species Vulnerable: American, Dwarf.\nCrocodiles are semi-aquatic and live in wetland areas, freshwater rivers or lakes, or saltwater \u2013 residing in estuaries, lagoons, or mangrove swamps, rather than far out at sea.\nThere are 14 species of crocodiles, which vary in lifespan between 35 \u2013 75 years, and considerably in size. The smallest, the Dwarf Crocodile, grows to an average 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) in length, and weighs 40 \u2013 71 pounds (18 to 32 kg, or 3 to 5 stone).\nThe largest crocodile is the Saltwater Crocodile, which can grow up to 23.0 ft (7.0 m) in length, weighing 2,200 \u2013 2,600 lb (1,000 to 1,200 kg, or 150 to 190 stone).\nSome species are active during the day, while other species are only nocturnal. Crocodiles mostly hunt at night, are carnivorous animals and very efficient hunters, with excellent hearing and eyesight.\nThey are aggressive, ambush predators, waiting for their prey to venture close to their hiding position, before rushing to attack. A crocs diet mostly includes other animals, reptiles, birds and fish.\nInteresting Crocodile Facts\n1. Crocodiles are carnivores, which generally means they eat only meat. However, a recent study proved they also enjoy an occasional taste of fruit.\nThe 2013 study concluled \u201cthere is little doubt that on occasion, fruit is deliberately consumed, often in large quantities\u201c, along with their normal meat-heavy diets of mammals, birds, and fish.\n2. Crocodiles can go through 4,000 teeth over a lifetime.\nCrocodiles have between 60-110 teeth. When a crocodile loses a tooth, there is a small replacement already on standby. They are able to replace each of their 80 teeth up to 50 times over their lifespan.\n3. A crocodile\u2019s jaws can apply 5,000 pounds of pressure per square inch \u2013 the strongest bite of any animal in the world.\nA human\u2019s jaw only produces 100 pounds of pressure per square inch in comparison. A crocodiles bite is 10 times more powerful than a great white shark.\n4. Crocodiles have relatively weak jaw opening muscles, which can be held shut with just a rubber band, or your bare hands.\nAlthough, that\u2019s not advisable! However, it has enabled scientists to study them closer!\n5. An easy way to tell the difference between a crocodile and an alligator, is when a crocodile closes it\u2019s mouth, all teeth are visible \u2013 as the upper and lower jaw are the same width.\nWhereas an alligator possesses small depressions in the upper jaw for the lower teeth, meaning they are not visible when their mouth is shut.\n6. Another key difference to an alligator is snout shape. Alligators have wider, U-shaped snouts, while crocodiles are more pointed and V-shaped.\nCrocodiles are generally a little more aggressive, and often larger and stronger, too.\n7. The longest crocodile captured alive measured 6.17 m (20.2 ft) and weighed at 1,075 kg (2,370 lb) by a National Geographic team in Agusan del Sur Province, Philippines.\n\u2018Lolong\u2019 was a saltwater crocodile and the largest ever in captivity.\n8. Crocodiles don\u2019t sweat. To keep cool, they open their mouths which is known as \u201cmouth gaping,\u201d very similar to panting.\nThey are not displaying aggression when you see them with their mouths wide open! They often sleep with their mouths wide open to release heat.\n9. Crocodiles are extremely fast in the water, swimming up to speeds of 35 kilometers per hour (22 mph).\nThey use their powerful tails to propel themselves through water, and their feet as rudders to steer.\n10. It\u2019s a common myth that crocodiles can run fast on land. They can \u2018belly run\u2019 up to 17 kilometers per hour (11 mph) for short distances.\nCrocs tire easily on land and prefer to stay in water, coming ashore only to bask in the sun, or to lay eggs.\n11. Crocs can hold their breath underwater for more than an hour.\nCambridge researchers have shown that this ability depends on a tiny fragment of the animal\u2019s haemoglobin, which is the protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\n12. Crocodiles swallow small stones to improve digestion. These stones help grind up the food in their stomachs.\nSwallowing stones (known as \u2018gastroliths\u2019) is especially beneficial for crocodiles that eat their prey whole, or for tougher animals with shells and bones. A gastrolith can remain inside the stomach for years.\n13. The expression to cry \u2018crocodile tears\u2019 (to display insincere or a false display of emotion), derives from crocodiles shedding tears, while they eat their prey.\nWhile this was originally an ancient belief, studies have shown that crocodiles eyes do water while they eat, but not with remorse \u2013 for biological reasons, due to the hisses and huffs during feeding.\n14. Crocodiles have acute senses, an evolutionary advantage that makes them highly successful predators.\nCrocodiles are mainly nocturnal hunters and have excellent night vision. Their sense of smell and hearing are also extremely well developed.\n15. Crocodiles have been known to occasionally cannibalize smaller crocodiles.\nThere have been recorded cases of larger crocodiles eating smaller, or younger crocs.\n16. Crocodiles are ambush and opportunistic predators, capable of preying upon large mammals, such as smaller elephants, hippos, sharks or big cats.\nSome species like the freshwater crocodile will mostly eat fish, while larger species like the saltwater crocodile or the Nile crocodile, will consume buffalo, zebra, deer and wild boar.\n17. Crocodiles have the most acidic stomach of any vertebrate.\nThis allows them to dissolve and digest bones, hooves and horns or shells from their prey.\n18. Crocodiles perform a \u2018death roll\u2019 to overcome prey, clamping on using their jaws, and spinning around powerfully.\nThe spinning motion of the roll disorientates the prey, dragging them under the water and helps separate limbs from the body of larger animals to easily ingest.\n19. Crocodiles vocalize to communicate. The young of some species squeak and grunt, while adult crocs can growl, hiss or roar at each other.\nMany species will also respond to other noises, such as engine noise, gun shots or even people mimicking crocodiles.\n20. Crocodiles can sleep with one eye wide open.\nOnly some other reptiles, birds and dolphins can do the same. They generally sleep with two eyes closed, though.\n21. Larger crocodiles can go for over a year without eating a meal.\nA croc\u2019s metabolism is super efficient, using and storing nearly the entirety of the food it consumes. In extreme circumstances, they are able to shut down and live off their own tissue for a long period of time.\n22. Worldwide, crocodiles are estimated to kill about 1,000 humans per year.\nHundreds of those crocodile attacks occur in Africa, often in small commuinities where they not widely reported.\nCrocodile Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Reptilia Order: Crocodilia Family: Crocodylidae Subfamily: Crocodylinae\nSpecies List & Habitat"}

But whatever the case may be, one of these 30 happy facts about animals is bound to bring a smile to your face.\nA lot of these interesting facts also underscore the similarities and emotional connections that people can share with animals, which raises a broader and more intriguing question \u2013 what is it about animals that we love so much?\nAccording to scientists at the California Institute of Technology and the University of California at Los Angeles, humans experience an emotional reaction to animals (both cute and dangerous) in an ancient and fundamental part of their brain called the amygdala. The amygdala is involved with emotion, emotional learning, and the formation of memories. So it could be that our appreciation for fun animals stems from an ancient need to evaluate whether these animals were friends or foes. And it could be that they react in just the same way to us.\nLet\u2019s leave this question open for now though, as there\u2019s a list of animal trivia and fun facts about animals waiting for you below.\nh/t: Distractify\n1.

Animals that are considered mammals include warm-blooded vertebrates that have hair or fur and whose babies drink milk. Unlike other animal types like birds and insects, all mammal babies drink milk that comes from their mother\u2019s bodies. This is one of the key ways to know if an animal is a mammal. See the complete list of mammals.\nReptiles Lizards, dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and snakes \u2013 all belong to that ancient and stout class of animals known as the reptiles. This is a diverse group with more than 10,000 different species and a huge representation in the fossil record. Once the dominant land vertebrates on the planet, reptiles still occupy just about every single ecosystem outside of the extreme north and south. See the complete list of reptiles.\nFish Fish are aquatic vertebrates. They usually have gills, paired fins, a long body covered with scales, and tend to be cold-blooded. \"Fish\" is a term used to refer to lampreys, sharks, coelacanths and ray-finned fishes, but is not a taxonomic group, which is a clade or group containing a common ancestor and all its descendants. See the complete list of fish.\nBirds Birds, members of the class Aves, include more than 10,400 living species. Their feathers distinguish them from all other classes of animal; no other animals on earth have them. If you see an animal with feathers, it\u2019s undoubtedly a bird. Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded vertebrates with four-chambered hearts. However, they are more closely related to reptiles and are believed to have evolved from dinosaurs. See the complete list of birds.\nAmphibians The official class of amphibians is Amphibia. To have the classification of an amphibian, an animal must be a vertebrate, require water to survive, be cold-blooded, and spend time both on land and in water. Though other animals only live on land or in the water, amphibians have the unique ability to thrive equally in both. Amphibians cover over 6,000 different species across the globe, but about 90% are frogs. See the complete list of amphibians.\nInvertebrates The definition of an invertebrate is any animal that does not have a backbone or vertebral column. The most prolific and easily recognizable members of the invertebrate family are insects. It\u2019s estimated that upwards of 30 million individual species of invertebrates may exist accounting for between 90-95 percent of all organisms on the planet. See the complete list of invertebrates.\nInsects All insects are part of the taxonomical phylum Arthropoda, and they are collectively referred to as arthropods. It is common to see this name misspelled as \u201canthropod,\u201d but this is not the correct term. They can be found in nearly every environment on the planet, and they currently account for over half of all known living organisms in the world. They have undergone many cycles of evolution depending on the resources available to them.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "What Color Is A Lion? Interesting Facts On Lion's Appearance ... - Kidadl", "url": "https://kidadl.com/fun-facts/what-color-is-a-lion-interesting-facts-on-lion-s-appearance-for-kids", "text": "The majority of the lion population exists in the wild forests of Africa and the Sahara desert.\nSome proportion of wild lions also exist in Gir forest, India. The lions found in India are closely related to those found in western Africa.\nIn India, the Gir forest is the only home for wild lions to roam around freely. You might find it interesting to know that a male lion weighs more than a female lion. Male lions weigh around 418 lb (190 kg) whereas the average weight of a female lion is only 264 lb (120 kg). Lions use this weight and the strength that comes with it to hunt their prey.\nVarious species of lions are present amongst the wildlife on Earth. All lions have manes. The mane makes a lion look more magnificent and royal than the lioness. The color of manes differs depending on the age of the lion. The fact is that the older they, get the darker their mane becomes. Apart from adding beauty to lions, the mane also acts as a protective shield against attacks directed towards their neck and head. It is interesting to know that all the cubs belonging to the same pride are raised together.\nThe females look after each of the cubs irrespective of which one is actually theirs. The pride usually consists of either a single male or a small number of male members for added protection. These fascinating creatures hunt even on stormy nights. As they can see well in the dark, they use the noise of the storm to move towards the prey undetected and hunt them. The females are either at the center of the hunt or chase the animals towards the center. They are powerful and their entire family has sharp teeth specifically designed to tear through the skin of their prey. They are scientifically referred to as Panthera leo. After reading all about the appearance of males and females, do check out our roarsome lion facts, and find out the answer to do bats lay eggs?\nWhat color is a lion's fur?\nMost lions seem to have a yellowish-brown coat. The shades may differ just like the differences in human skin color, however, it is always a shade of yellow and brown. It might be dark or light, it may be more yellowish or more towards the brown shade but nothing apart from that.\nThe cub of a lion is often of a light shade. A male cub does not have a mane, it develops as he grows older and more powerful. Cubs generally have spots on their body, and they are usually brown. These spots disappear on their own as the cub grows older. It is a fact that the shades of a lion are brown and yellow because they tend to live in the grasslands and this coat helps them to hide, undetected from their prey. As male lions of various species grow older, their mane slowly turns black along with the tip of their tail. Their dark mane and light coat act as the perfect camouflage, even at night.\nThese wild African and Asian species have powerful appearances. Some species have long manes, covering their forelimbs while some have white coats and fur. White lions are extremely rare. Even within white lions, there are variations. Some of them have white fur, some have white coats with brown or black manes while others have a light brown almost white shade of mane. The cubs of white lions look like little, white fur balls. They are specifically found in the South Africa region. White lions do exist and the reason for their changed color is a rare change in their genes.\nWhat color are a lion's eyes?\nThe color of the eyes is not the same for all animals. This is true for humans and also for lions and their cubs. All lions have a shade of brown or amber in their eyes. The eye color of white lions is also brown or amber. This is probably because even though their skin lacks brown pigmentation, their eyes don\u2019t. An interesting fact is that certain rare white lions have blue eyes. This is the rarest of rare cases. When light falls on the eyes of most lions, whether male or female, it gets reflected as red or golden. This gives a very majestic look to this powerful animal.\nAnother interesting fact is that cubs are born blind. They cannot see anything for the first three to four days after they are born. When they open their eyes and start seeing, there is some difficulty because their vision is not very clear. They require constant support and care from the females in the pride. As they open their eyes, they are a shade of gray or blue. Over two to three months, the eyes start turning into a shade of brown or amber. Both male and female lions can see well at night.\nThe Panthera leo hunts better on moonless nights as the light from the moon tends to hinder their night vision ability. Lions have binocular vision. This essentially means that they can see everything that is happening in front of them but to see what is happening on the sides, they will have to move their entire head. Humans can see sideways without moving their heads even by a single centimeter; lions cannot do that. However, their binocular vision assists them in locating prey that is far away and they are pretty quick on their feet.\nWhat is the color of a lion mane?\nA lion's mane on its face starts as a light shade of brown or black. The mane appears at the age of six months. As the lion becomes older, the shade becomes dark. In some parts of Africa, maneless lions have also been observed. Although this goes against the traditional image of lions, it is true and can be seen in Kenya, Tanzania, and several other locations. This is especially true for the African species.\nExperiments have found that in the animal kingdom, a lion with a long, dark mane is considered most powerful. All other animals are scared of them. Even the female lions tend to choose the male who has a long and dark mane. By nature, however, it has been found that males with dark, long manes have trouble staying cool and tend to become more aggressive than lions without manes or with light, short manes. Barbary lions are known to be the strongest among the lion species. These were mountain species with long, dark manes. Only a few lions of this species are alive and have been kept in captivity, to protect them against poachers.\nHow does a lion's color help in their habitat?\nDifferent lions have different colors in order to thrive in their habitat. Lions mostly live in grasslands, where there are vast lands of tall, brownish grass. This matches the shade of the lion's coat and acts as the perfect camouflage to hide and attack. The Panthera leo take advantage of their habitat and attach survival meaning to it. Lions can hide in plain sight and appear as part of the habitat itself.\nThey are stealthy and the fur of this animal goes well with the background. These animals are part of a wild species but are family-oriented. They always stay in their family and protect one another. The fur helps the entire family to move undetected in the Gir forest and the African grasslands and deserts. Both lions and tigers have shades of brown and yellow in them. This is primarily to blend with their surroundings and assist in their survival. The mountain lions and white lions that roam the hilly, cold regions camouflage well with the mountainside vegetation and snow\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly facts for everyone to enjoy!

They have very few sweat glands and so they rest to conserve their energy while also trying to remain cool during the day.\nLion Talk\nLions have a lot of ways to communicate and some can be quite sophisticated. They will use nuzzling and head rubbing when they greet each other.\nLions also have vocalizations that include snarls, hissing, purrs, and meows with variations in pitch and intensity.\nThe lion has the loudest noise of any of the big cats. The roar communicates their location to other pride and can be heard as far away as 8 km.\nThe Male Lion\nWhen a male lion reaches complete maturity he develops the well-known \u2018mane\u2019 on his head and back. This is unique to lions as no other members of the big cat family develop a mane.\nFacts for Kids x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Facts for Kids\nThe mane is a sign of intimidation to other male lions while it also displays maturity to the female lions.

It is not uncommon for two lionesses to have their cubs at the same time as they can be raised together.\nThe pride works together and hunts intelligently, but the female of the pride is the main hunter. Most of their hunting occurs at night during the cooler hours.\nLions hunt mostly at night and therefore have great night vision. Their eyes are six times more sensitive to light than the eyes of a human being. It also allows them an excellent advantage when looking for prey.\nRelated Resources\nAll about Lions \u2013 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion\nLion Conservation \u2013 African Wildlife Foundation"}

They live over 11-14 year in the wild and most of the lions are present in Africa and a small portion are in India.

These groups that they live in are called \u201cpride\u201d , It includes all the males , females and their cubs. And If any pride has a large number of members then that group is the strongest among other groups and even the rival groups. Female Lions think that if they have more male lions then it will help them to protect their cubs and they also feel safer, The chance of survival is greater now. The Homes are also protected by them.\nLions can live without water but can\u2019t with food.\nLions have a tendency to live without water for 3-4 days in total but they can\u2019t stop the stomach from growling as lions need food everyday.

Their tongue is called papillae which is used to clean out the meat from every corner of bones. They eat around 1/4 part of the prey body meat.\nMale Lions Almost Sleep the Whole day.\nWhy I am Saying this because It has been seen that Male Lions if they want can sleep up to 18-20 hours a day.

All the cubs live together and can suckle the milk from any female lioness.\nLions Fulfill Water Requirement from Plants.\nLions can adapt to many climate changes and if they are in Desert area like the Kalahari Desert then they may manage the water from plants like the Tsamma melon as it has plenty of water and if the lion didn\u2019t get enough water , he finds prey and gets the water from the meat itself.\nLions Find Storms as the Best Time for Hunting.\nAs you know During Storms , their is too much noise of wind and thunder that makes the voice of lions running towards prey gets unheard, that makes it harder for prey to hear anything even with dusty winds sometime prey didn\u2019t see what\u2019s coming towards them , So lion gets advantage here and catch the prey easily.\nLions do Hunting at night.\nLion eyes are quite adaptive at night and it\u2019s dark low light , Where other animals didn\u2019t see clearly at dark night, Lion gets this advantage to kill the prey easily. Lionesses and male lions work together to catch the prey , Female lions stay at the center so that male can chase out it at center or this happens also vice versa where male wait at center and females chase the prey to the center.\nLions are at high risk of extinction.\nAccording to Panthera.org , Over 26 African Countries Lions are extinct about 95% that is a huge number meaning only 5% population is left behind. Experts say only 20,000 are there , other lions have vanished from the wildlife.\nOne small population exists in India , There is a 29% rise in the Lion population in 2020. The Numbers goes from 523 to 674 this year , It was 411 in 2015. So it\u2019s good news that they have managed to secure the lion species greatly.\nMost Searched Questions:\nWhat do lions eat\nThey mostly eat other animals that are medium to large in size , All these individual animals are called as prey. Lions eat buffalo, giraffes, antelopes, zebras , young elephants, crocodiles, rhinos etc. If they don\u2019t find big animals then they start hunting smaller ones\nlike birds, rabbits, lizards, hares, tortoises, mice\u2019s.\nFacts about lions for kids\nLions are a species that forms a pride which is a group of animals. They are the 2nd largest species in terms of cats on planet earth. Heaviest lion in the world which has weight of about 826lb (375 kg) ,\nthis is crazy as the weight was much higher than a normal lion.\nWhere do lions live\nMost animals found in Sub-Saharan Africa And One Section of Lions also live in India\u2019s Gir forest which is in the state of Gujarat. Asiatic lions are in India and African lions are in African region. With Declining Population in Africa , from 2015 \u2013 2020,\nWe see in India Lion Population is increasing, which is good news for Lion Species.\nFacts about lions habitat\nLions enjoy habitats like Dense scrub, thick grasslands, open woodland , Rainforest, Savanna etc and they are energetic for night hunting as catching prey is easy. Now lions are living in National parks and Wildlife sanctuary for the safety and food because they are termed as endangered,\nthe population of lions is less in 2020.\nFast facts about lions\nlions can run faster than many animals, heavy eaters, advantage on storms, takes water from animal body & plants, largest cat species after tiger, roar reach to 7-8km, weight is over 420 lbs, lives in pride (group) of all lions (female, male, cubs),\njump is about 36 feet high, Check whole info above.\nDangerous facts about lions\nAccording to the telegraph, Every year lions make prey to 250 people and lions are more dangerous than many prey animals. Males on the Pride won\u2019t Stay longer and focus on food and go out hunting. Lions only come to pride if they want to mate or\nthe other reason would be the pride has gotten more food to eat then he will stay.\nFacts about lions and tigers\nLions are majority wise found in African region while tigers basically belong to Asia. lions have Longer tails in length and tigers have shorter tails than lions. Tiger weight is 650 pounds and lions are about 330 \u2013 550 kg. Tiger even longer than lions,\nif you measure tigers are 12.5 feet and lions are 6.5 to 11 feet.\nConclusion\nWe Any Government and people Listening to us, We wanted to say, Save animals , Save Lions, Save the Lives of all Animals as they are precious gift given by Mother Earth.\nEarthlyknowhow.com is website that is known to provide every information on animal and we love animals.. :)"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "20 Astonishing Cheetah Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/cheetahs/", "text": "Cheetah Profile\nThe Cheetah is a large, slender cat that live in sub-Saharan Africa, and in eastern and southern African parks. Cheetahs can also be found in small numbers in southern Algeria, northern Niger and Iran.\nThe Cheetah is the fastest land animal on the planet. They are members of the family Felidae, which includes the tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, snow leopard, and other big cats.\nCheetah Facts Overview\nHabitat: Dry Grasslands, Scrub Forests & Savannahs. Location: sub-Saharan Africa, eastern and southern Africa, southern Algeria, northern Niger and Iran Lifespan: 15 \u2013 20 Years Size: 112 \u2013 150 cm (45 \u2013 60 in) Weight: 46 \u2013 159 pounds (21 \u2013 72 kg) Color: Tan with black spots Diet: Gazelles, Wildebeest, Impalas, Rabbits, Birds, Hares, Antelopes, & Warthogs Predators: Lions, Leopards, Hyenas, Eagles (Young cubs) Top Speed: 100 kph (65 mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nVulnerable\nCheetahs are found in open and dry grasslands in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa, although they were once widespread throughout Africa and Asia. The majority of Cheetahs today inhabit natural reserves or parks.\nCheetahs in the wild typically live between 10 \u2013 15 years in the wild. Some can reach 20 years of age while in captivity.\nThe Cheetah has a slender body with long legs and is clearly designed for speed. They are tan in color with a massive covering of black spots all over the body. The unique patterns of the spots are as distinctive as fingerprints are on humans.\nCheetahs are easy to distinguish from other large cats as they are smaller in size, have a smaller head and ears than most other cats, have a spotted coat and carry what are known as tear stripes that run from the corner of each eye to the side of their nose.\nThese meat eaters typically hunt and eat impalas, wildebeest calves, gazelles and other smaller hoofed animals. They are diurnal, which means they hunt during the day and rely on tall grasses to hide when on the hunt. Cheetahs mostly hunt in either the late morning or early evening.\nA typical chase can last between 20 and 60-seconds with only half of them being successful. They have large non-retractable claws that are used to prevent skidding when cornering quickly, and to pull down an animal.\nInteresting Cheetah Facts\n1. Cheetahs are the fastest land animal in the world.\nThese cats are fast. They can typically reach speeds of up to 98 kilometers per hour (61 miles per hour), and can go from 0 to 60 Mph in just 3-seconds, which is faster than most super-cars. Their stride length becomes as long as 7m (23ft) at full pace, which means the cheetah spends more than half the time airborne.\n2. Cheetahs don\u2019t simply rely on their speed, they anticipate the escape tactics of different prey when hunting.\nA team or researchers found that Cheetahs hunting tactics were specific to characteristics of their prey, and are far more sophisticated than thought.\n3. The Cheetah tail helps them steer at high speed.\nIt may look large and cumbersome, but when on the chase, the tail of the Cheetah plays an important role. It actually helps to steer the cheetah as it runs, like a rudder on a boat.\nIt\u2019s not a cheetahs speed that\u2019s their greatest attribute when hunting, it\u2019s this agility \u2014 their skill at jumping sideways, changing directions quickly and slowing down almost instantly.\n4. Cheetahs tire quickly.\nDue to the energy required to run at such speed, cheetahs can only maintain a chase for between 200 \u2013 300m. If a hunt isn\u2019t successful after 1 min, they usually stop to rest.\n5. Fossils have revealed that Cheetahs date way, way back.\nCarbon dating has estimated the age of some cheetah fossils as being between one and two million years old.\n6. Cheetah can\u2019t roar.\nUnlike big cats like the lion, cheetahs are unable to roar. They are closer to your domestic house cat in that they can purr, both inhaling and exhaling.\n7. Female adult cheetahs often live alone.\nKnown to be typically solitary animals, females raise their cubs alone for about a year before they leave. Male cheetahs sometimes will live in a small group of brothers from the same litter.\n8. Cheetahs abandon around 10% of kills to larger predators.\nIn order to prevent losing their kill to another big and nasty carnivore (Lions, hyenas or even vultures), Cheetahs will move their prey to a secluded spot, and eat quickly. They will also hunt during the day when predators are generally asleep, and only end up abandoning a relatively small number of kills.\n9. The cheetahs spots act as camouflage.\nThe cheetah can have between 2,000 and 3,000 spots, to help it blend into surroundings when hunting or hiding from predators.\n10. There is no end to the cheetah mating season.\nCheetahs can mate any time of the year with gestation lasting just three months. A litter can range between 2 and 4 cubs.\n11. Cheetah cubs have a very different coat to that of adults.\nThe cubs have a smoky colored, long, wooly coat called a mantle. It runs down their backs and acts as a form of camouflage. It helps to conceal the cubs and their mothers assist in this by constantly seeking places to \u2018hide\u2019 them to protect the cubs from predators until they are old enough to take care of themselves.\n12. Cubs get moved around a lot.\nFemale cheetahs will move their cubs to different hiding places every few days. Once the cubs reach 5 or 6 weeks of age, they will follow their mothers and even start eating from their kills. By the time the cubs reach one year of age, they are hunting on their own. At 15 months, they will move away from their mother and either find a mate or sometimes live in a small group.\n13. Cheetahs are not that thirsty\u2026for water that is.\nHaving adapted for life in an environment where there is little water, cheetahs can go three to four days without a drop of it. That doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t actually get any liquids at all. As it turns out, cheetahs are able to draw water from the animals they hunt, kill and eat.\n14. Cheetahs start families early.\nThe male can reproduce at the age of one while females can begin rearing families at the age of two. The pairing is mostly random as cheetahs will mate with many different cheetahs during their lifetime.\n15. Females end up raising their young alone.\nMales do not participate in the rearing of their young however, females have been described as caring, affectionate and dedicated mothers.\n16. Cheetah cubs have a shockingly high mortality rate.\nOne study in the 90\u2019s the Serengeti found that 95% of cubs died before reaching adulthood. Many deaths were due to Lions, but also other predators and disease.\n17. Cheetahs can do something no other cat can do.\nThe Cheetah is the only big cat that is capable of turning in mid-air while sprinting.\n18. It\u2019s a myth that cheetahs abandon hunts due to overheating when running.\nTwo Harvard scientists in 1973 set-up an artificial experiment in a laboratory, that that concluded a cheetah would be forced to stop running when their body temperature reached 40.5 degrees Celsius.\nHowever, new research in real world conditions shows that cheetahs body temperatures never rise that high in the wild, and they don\u2019t abandon hunts due to overheating.\n19. Cheetahs have been around for a very, very long time.\nSumerians trained cheetahs for hunting back in 3000 BC. The Indian (then Hindustan) ruler Emperor Akbar had 1,000 trained cheetahs he used for hunting while in power from 1556 to 1605. Even King Tut\u2019s tomb (1400 BC) contained various cheetah artifacts. It was because of this that historians believed that the cheetah was a sacred animal to ancient Egyptians.\n20. Cheetahs are slowly disappearing from the planet.\nAt the turn of the 20th century there were well over 100,000 cheetahs. Today the numbers are considerably less with roughly 7,000 in Africa and a few hundred in Iran. They have been driven out of their historic range by humans, and are now only found in Algeria, Angola, Northern Niger, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, and Mozambique. The species is already almost extinct in Asia, with fewer than 50 individuals remaining in one isolated pocket of Iran.\nCheetah Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Infraorder: Cetacea Suborder: Feliformia Family: Felidae Subfamily:\nFelinae Genus:\nAcinonyx Species Name:\nAcinonyx Jubatus\nRelated \u2018Big Cat\u2019 Facts"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "What Do Lions Eat? (Diet & Facts) - American Tarantula & Animals", "url": "https://www.atshq.org/what-do-lions-eat/", "text": "What do lions eat? Meat. The end of the story. Are you sure it is that simple? Yes, lions prefer consuming meat and are not too picky, but they still won\u2019t grab any animal passing by. Let\u2019s take a look.\nWhat Do Lions Eat in the Wild\nLions are carnivores and fierce predators known for their hunting effectiveness. They typically hunt in the prides (groups) that consist of up to three males, a dozen females, and their cubs.\nSince females are significantly faster, they are primary hunters in the group, particularly during hunting on open savannas. Lonely male lions choose denser habitats for hunt since these places are better for surprising prey without much chasing.\nLion types Scientific classification Lion Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Carnivora Suborder Feliformia Family Felidae Subfamily Pantherinae Genus Panthera Species Panthera leo\nA pride usually comes close to the prey herd, spreads around, and attack it from several directions. Since their stamina is not at high levels, they always hunt in short bursts, attack the victim from the back, and bite it to the neck.\nInterestingly, lions\u2019 hunt is much more successful when they chase prey in a group. In such a case, their success rate is 30%, while lonely males catch prey in only 17% to 19% of hunts. They often steal carrions from other predators, particularly hyenas, when they get the chance.\nOne lion kills approximately 15 large mammals a year. Since their routine includes a lot of running and a few days without food, these animals eat up to 70 pounds (31.75 kg) of meat for one meal.\nIn other words, when a pride catches an African buffalo that weighs approximately 2,000 pounds (907 kg), all members will get a share without any leftovers for vultures and hyenas.\nWhen there is enough food, adult males will be satisfied with 15 pounds (7 kg) of meat daily, while females need 11 pounds (5 kg), or about 15% of their body weight. The strongest male always eats first, and then come lionesses with cubs. Lions will always pick out prey, that is:\nIn small prey groups\nAlmost always in the weighing range of 420 to 1,200 pounds (190.5 \u2013 545 kg), with a preferred weight of 770 pounds (350 kg)\nLives within 218.72266 yards (200 m)\nEven though lions enjoy eating warthogs, zebras, Grant\u2019s gazelles, and wildebeests the most, a list of their top prey also includes:\nJuvenile hippopotamuses\nWild pigs and nilgais\nCattle and buffalos\nCamel and giraffes\nAntelopes, gemsboks, and deer\nChitals and goats\nWild dogs\nBaby elephants\nCrocodiles\nBaboons\nIf the lion is hungry and some small prey comes up, it will grab it without hesitation. So, its victims can also be:\nMice and hares\nBirds\nLizards and tortoises\nMonkey\nLions can also nibble some grass from time to time, like domesticated cats. It will help this animal overcome problems with an upset stomach.\nOne study about Asiatic lions\u2019 eating habits shows that they primarily choose wild animals in 47% of cases while livestock was prey on 53% of occasions. The list includes:\nCattle (31%), chitals (28%) buffalos (16%) as preferred prey\nWild pigs (6%)\nNilgais and goats (3% each)\nCamels (2%)\nSince Asiatic lions live in a restricted area in Gir National Forest, their livestock predation is considerably higher than in Africa lions.\nEven though African lions can hunt giraffes, they will choose only smaller ones. In most cases, they will stay away from adult elephants, hippos, and rhinos.\nLions are definitely at the top of the food chain, and they can even kill rival predators like cheetahs, leopards, and hyenas. However, they typically don\u2019t enjoy their meat since it can\u2019t provide enough energy for their bodies. Therefore, they will leave such carcasses to scavengers.\nLions won\u2019t typically kill each other except in a direct conflict while taking control over a new territory. In rare cases, male lions can attack and kill a lioness after refusing to mate. It is also possible for males to eat their cubs when they want females to mate earlier.\nThe rare animal that dares to attack a lion is a hyena. It is not common, but a hyena clan can try to overwhelm a lone old male lion.\nLion\u2019s menu at the Zoo contains:\nBeef meat\nHorse meat\nOther varieties of meats\nBeef bones\nSince lions in captivity eat daily, males will need about 8 pounds (3.6 kg) of meat, while females require approximately 6 pounds (2.7 kg).\n5 Facts About Lions\nLions (Panthera leo) are powerfully built kings of beasts and the second cat in size after tigers. They live in Africa grassland, savanna, open woodland, and dense scrub and hunt at night. About 650 lions live in Wildlife Sanctuary and Gir National Park in India under strict protection.\nHabitat\nAs you can see, lions roam primarily in restricted areas of Asia and eastern and southern Africa. Believe it or not, lions once lived in:\nNorthern Africa, including Egypt\nEurope, including Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria\nThe Middle East, including Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia\nNowadays, only 20,000 African lions live in the wild, and their population is in decline. Since their number has reduced by 40% during the last 30 years, this species is officially considered vulnerable to extinction.\nCubs\nNewborn cubs (lionets, whelps) are small with closed eyes in the first two to three weeks. That is a reason why these cute creatures are highly vulnerable in that period. Therefore, lionesses keep their babies hidden and protected from snakes, large bird predators, and other lions.\nSince females sharing the same pride give birth at about the same time, they will raise their litters together. Male lions never participate in parenting, but most of them will protect the pride\u2019s cubs.\nCubs depend on their mother\u2019s milk for about six months. They consume only milk for three months and then start eating some meat. It is also time for them to get their first hunting lessons.\nYoung lions need approximately two years to become proficient hunters and another two to master this activity. Lionesses will take advantage of abundant prey to select weak and old animals to involve their offspring in a hunt.\nHunting\nEven though an average pride includes numerous lions, only one female is responsible for almost half of the kills. Additionally, these animals enjoy stealing food from scavengers but often leave excess food to them when possible.\nThey rather choose to do that instead of allowing hyenas and vultures to disturb their sleep after a hearty meal.\nLions are greedy and often attack another prey they spot, although they already have enough meat. They will hunt although they are full when a favorable opportunity arises.\nSince their maximum speed is 37 mph (60 km/h), they need to be clever hunters. They stalk their prey and get as close as possible. Only then can the chase begin.\nThe typical tactics include ankle-taping prey. They clip an animal\u2019s ankle while running to make it easy to catch it. Sometimes large males jump on the prey\u2019s back and kill it by grabbing its neck. It is also not unusual for these predators to climb trees and jump on the elephant\u2019s back while walking underneath.\nSometimes, a group of lions will ambush prey, mainly when stalking is too difficult. Each of them will take its own position at the center and a left or right side. A few lions will quickly run toward prey while others wait for it in the bush.\nEven though multiple lions are involved in the hunt, the pride leader male will eat first, then females with cubs. Weaker lions need to wait their turn but often stay hungry if the prey is not big enough. Luckily, an average lion can survive up to two weeks without food.\nLions prefer living near rivers and streams, although they don\u2019t need too much water. The reason is prey. They know that all these animals will come to drink sooner or later.\nKeep in mind that some lions can be highly dangerous for humans. Even though it is not typical behavior, they can eat people, like well-known Tsavo man-eating lions.\nDaily activities\nMale lions always ensure their territory of up to 100 sq miles (259 km2) by marking it. When the hunt is over and the lions finish with their meal, it is time for rest. They will sleep and relax from morning to late afternoon when it is too hot out there.\nAfter taking a rest for approximately 20 hours a day, they will enjoy socializing from late afternoon to evening.\nThe pride members will enjoy licking each other\u2019s faces and rubbing their heads on one another. Sometimes, you can hear them roar in the chorus. It is only their way of polite social communication.\nWhite lions\nWhite lions live in an endemic area in South Africa. The Timbavati Game Reserve is a part of the Greater Kruger National Park, where only ten of these beauties live in the wild. There are only 300 white lions worldwide, including those living in the Zoos.\nSummary\nLions\u2019 menu will depend on the region and season, but they are strict carnivores, and nothing can change that fact. These ferocious predators enjoy hunting prey but avoid attacking other predators, adult elephants, hippos, and rhinos. Plus, animal King won\u2019t catch small rodents and birds unless it starves."}

How many of them live in the United States? We\u2019ve done the research and gathered the facts. Here is the mountain lion population by state.\nMeet the Mountain Lion\nThe mountain lion (Puma concolor) is also known as the cougar, panther, or puma. The cougar is one of the big cat species native to North America. Some people call it \u201cAmerica\u2019s lion.\u201d\nThe mountain lion is a large, slender cat whose coat ranges from tawny yellow to dark brown. It is a fierce, agile predator that has adapted well to many different environments. Mountain lions are found in mountains, coniferous forests, grasslands, swamps, and dry scrublands.\nThe mountain lion is also referred to as the cougar, panther, or puma. Unknown/Shutterstock.com\nWhere do mountain lions live?\nThey have an extensive range and are the most widespread of any living mammal in the Americas. In the United States, however, their population was decimated by decades of extensive hunting. Hunting bans and conservation efforts helped mountain lions regain some of their former territories. There are no resident populations in the eastern U.S., but these states may see cats who are passing through.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe mountain lion is a fierce, nocturnal predator who can run, climb, and even swim when chasing prey. They eat:\nWhat is the mountain lion population by state?\nThe total mountain lion population in the United States is estimated at 20,000 to 30,000.\nIt is difficult to count specific numbers of mountain lions because these cats are mobile and solitary. Some stay and breed in certain areas, but others travel long distances to find their prey. They\u2019re also secretive, nocturnal, and excellent at avoiding humans.\nA state can only be classified as having a particular species if it has an active, breeding, and self-sustaining wild population of cougars. That is only true of some states. Mountain lions may be spotted in other states, but they are just passing through on the hunt for prey.\nFor this article, we listed states that have active, breeding populations of mountain lions and those that occasionally see traveling cougars. For our information, we relied on official numbers from each state\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of Natural Resources, or another source.\nMOUNTAIN LION POPULATION BY STATE\nAlaska: Unconfirmed sightings\nOfficials with Alaska\u2019s Department of Fish and Game regularly hear about mountain lion sightings, but there have not yet been any confirmed sightings. In the most recent sighting, the cat in question turned out to be a lynx. At this point, there\u2019s no proof of transient or resident mountain lions in Alaska.\nArizona has a stable population of mountain lions. They tend to live in mountainous areas and rocky hills. The state allows controlled hunting of them. Under the law, hunters can\u2019t kill females with kittens. The Department of Game and Fish says, \u201cThe population is stable to increasing in many parts of the state.\u201d\nMountain lions may be on their way back to Arkansas. There may be as many as 30 resident mountain lions in the state.\nCalifornia has one of the largest mountain lion populations in the country. The state classed mountain lions as endangered in 1972 and banned all hunting of them. The 2020 wildfires that ravaged California also affected mountain lion populations, killing an estimated 300 to 600 of them. Conservation groups and the state government have focused their efforts on ensuring the survival of mountain lions in California.\nThe mountains of Colorado are the perfect habitat for these nimble hunters. The state\u2019s dense forests, rocky terrain, and abundant wildlife offer many hiding places and lots of prey for food. As the state\u2019s Parks and Wildlife Department notes, \u201cColorado is prime mountain lion country.\u201d\nFlorida: 120 to 230\nFlorida is home to an endemic subspecies of the mountain lion known as the Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). It is the only mountain lion species with a breeding population in the eastern part of the U.S. It is the official state animal of Florida.\nFlorida panthers are a threatened species, but there is hope for their survival. According to the Nature Conservancy, there were only about 20 Florida panthers in 1973, and there are now more than 200. In 2017, the state enclosed more than 3,000 acres of Florida panther habitat that will remain permanently protected.\nMountain lions are widespread in the state. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game allows controlled hunting of mountain lions in specific situations. The law forbids killing cubs or females with young cubs. It is also illegal to trap, snare, or capture them. However, the Mountain Lion Foundation argues that Idaho has the most liberal mountain hunting laws of all the western states. It believes the annual hunting limits of 400 to 600 are too high given the population of only 2,000.\nIllinois: Confirmed sightings\nThere have been confirmed sightings of mountain lions passing through Illinois on their way to another state.\nIowa: Confirmed sightings\nPeople have spotted cougars making their way through the state.\nKansas: Confirmed sightings\nPeople have seen cougars in Kansas.\nMichigan: Increase in confirmed sightings\nThe Michigan Department of Natural Resources confirmed 10 cougar sightings in the state in 2021. All were in the Upper Peninsula. This continues an increase in confirmed sightings over several years. However, biologists have not been able to confirm that there are any breeding populations.\nMinnesota: Confirmed sightings\nLike Michigan, Minnesota has seen an increase in confirmed sightings but no sign of a resident population.\nMissouri: Confirmed sightings\nMissouri\u2019s mountain lions were extirpated in 1923, but cougars pass through the state on their travels.\nMontana\u2019s mountain lions are found all over the state. The state Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Department estimates that more than half the state is suitable mountain lion habitat. This is mostly in the western and central regions. Montana, like other western states, allows controlled, restricted hunting of mountain lions.\nNebraska: Confirmed sightings\nLike other midwestern states, Nebraska has seen an uptick in confirmed cougar sightings, but it does not have a resident population.\nAs Nevada\u2019s apex predator, the mountain lion enjoys a healthy, stable population in the state. These big cats are present in all of Nevada\u2019s mountain areas and are protected by state law. They control rodent and deer populations and are considered keystones of their ecosystems.\nNew Mexico\u2019s cougars live in the rugged, hilly areas of the state. They are protected by state law. Because the state also protects bighorn sheep, however, it allows controlled hunting. The hunting is designed to allow both these species to thrive in New Mexico\u2019s hills.\nNew York: Confirmed sightings\nNew York has had transient cougars passing through.\nNorth Dakota: Confirmed sightings\nThere are 20 to 30 confirmed sightings each year.\nOklahoma: Confirmed sightings\nThe state has documented cougar sightings, but there are no confirmed breeding areas.\nMountain lions are native to Oregon, and their population is thriving. Despite this, human encounters with these secretive, nocturnal animals are rare. The cougar population in Oregon is considered healthy and at sustainable levels. Oregon allows controlled hunting of cougars.\nSouth Dakota: 200 to 300\nSouth Dakota successfully reintroduced mountain lions in recent years. Since then, it has seen its population grow to a small but steady 200 to 300 cougars.\nTennessee: Confirmed sightings\nTennessee has had a handful of confirmed sightings.\nAlthough there is a breeding population in the western part of the state, wildlife biologists are not certain how many mountain lions live in Texas. They live in the western region, Trans-Pecos region, and southern Texas. Wildlife officials say they have evidence that the population is growing, but exact numbers are not known.\nUtah\u2019s mountainous areas and swamps are home to cougars. They have been spotted in Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park. Many visitors to the state\u2019s parks are eager to see cougars or cougar tracks, but human encounters are rare. The state allows restricted hunting of cougars.\nLike Alaska, Vermont is a state where many residents report cougar sightings. State wildlife biologists say these usually turn out to be bobcats.\nWashington\u2019s mountain lions live all over the state except for a small area around the Columbia River Basin. They live in the Cascade Mountains and are an important predator in the state\u2019s ecosystems. In 1996, Washington passed a law banning the use of hounds to hunt mountain lions.\nWisconsin: Confirmed sightings\nThere have been some confirmed sightings of cougars. State wildlife officials believe these mountain lions have crossed over from a population group living in the Black Hills of South Dakota.\nThe population has been stable for decades, but in recent years, it has dropped. This is caused by many things, and it has led to some debate about Wyoming\u2019s hunting policy. Wyoming citizens have urged the Fish and Game Commission to reduce hunting permits until the population is stable."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "White Lion Facts - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/white-lion-facts", "text": "Have you ever heard about the white lions of Africa? If no, go through this article that will shed light on some amazing white lion facts.\nCan you imagine lions as white as polar bears? If no, then you are in for a big surprise. There are true white lions that are not albinos. These white-haired lions are believed to be natives to the Timbavati region of South Africa. They are said to have lived in this region for a very long time. But officially, the first recorded sighting of white lions happened during the latter part of the 1920s. However, these animals garnered public attention only during the 1970s, through the book named \u2018The White Lions of Timbavati\u2019, which was authored by Chris McBride.\nWhite Lion Taxonomy\nThese lions are like regular lions, except for the color of their coat. Lions belong to genus Panthera in the family Felidae. Lions (Panthera leo) are believed to have evolved in Africa, before thousands of years. There are eight sub species of lions and one among them is Panthera leo krugeri, known as the Southeast African Lion. These lions are found in the Southeast regions of Africa, which include the Kruger National Park. It is in this region that white lions are found. So these animals are also referred to as African white lions, and are classified under the subspecies Panthera leo krugeri. So white lions belong to this subspecies, in which most of the members have a sandy brown coat color.\nWhy are White Lions \u2018White\u2019\nWhite lions are unique for their white coat. You may come across white variants of various animal species. They include white rabbits, white squirrels, white giraffes, etc. White coat color in animals could be due to a congenital disorder called albinism, which causes complete or partial loss of melanin in the eyes, hair and skin. Unlike albino lions, white lions have normal-colored eyes, lips, and paw pads. Just like the ordinary lions, white lions too have a golden to yellowish-brown eye color. In some rare cases, blue-colored eyes are also seen.\nThe white coat color of these lions is often attributed to a genetic condition called \u2018leucism\u2019. It is said that such hair color is due to chinchilla mutation. This mutation results in deposition of lesser amounts of pigments along the hair shaft, resulting in a paler coat. So these lions may have a coat color that ranges from pale blond to almost pure white. It has been observed that white lion cubs are born with a pure white hair color that fades to blond, as they grow. In short, it is the recessive gene (called chinchilla or color inhibitor gene) that is said to be responsible for the white hair color.\nAs this is a genetic condition, the young ones produced by a white lion may be tawny as well as white. Only those cubs with dominance of these recessive genes will be white and not others. However, there is still no answer for the question, why this type of mutation is found only in lions belonging to this region. This is one of the intriguing facts about white lions.\nWhite Lion Population\nAs aforementioned, white lions are not considered a separate subspecies. Their coat color is due to a rare color mutation. So the number of white lions are also very less. It is believed that these lions are almost extinct in the wild. Now most of the white lion population are found in zoos, where inbreeding is highly promoted. However, this may result in serious health problems. As they are very few in numbers, efforts are underway to restore the white lion population in South Africa.\nThe Global White Lion Protection Trust is one such organization that is worth mentioning. This organization has started reintroducing these lions to their native habitat. There are certain contentions that white lions are not fit for wildlife due to their white coat. It is said that the white coat does not offer them any camouflage, and this makes them unfit for living in the wild. However, there is no evidence to prove such contentions that have not been studied so far. But the white coat color could definitely be a disadvantage, as far as hunting is concerned. As of now, these animals are not protected by the law.\nDid you know that the African people used to believe that white lions are messengers of God and they represent purity and enlightenment? It was believed that disrespect to these animals will result in the wrath of God. Though these are only beliefs, the truth is that these magnificent animals may end up as legends, in the near future."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Gorilla images!\n\u201cThe gorilla is one of the closest living relatives to humans.\u201d\nThe name gorilla actually refers to four different subspecies of animals. They share 98 percent of their DNA with humans, and they are smart enough to learn sign language and use tools. Gorillas are far from the wild, violent beasts portrayed in entertainment, and they could even be considered rather shy. The wild population of gorillas is in rapid decline, and they are critically endangered. The average gorilla is as much as four times as strong as a human.\n6 Incredible Gorilla Facts!\nDespite their massive size and impressive strength (learn about the strongest animals in the world here), these great apes are primarily vegetarians.\nWild gorillas live only 35 years, but the oldest captive gorilla lived until the age of 63.\nAn adult is capable of bending an iron bar with only its hands.\nThese animals are actually quite shy, and they will normally choose to flee if given the opportunity when threatened.\nHealthy adults have no natural predators.\nApe vs. Gorilla: Gorillas are larger than other ape species and can weigh twice as much as the largest orangutans and more than five times the size of mandrills!\nGorilla Scientific Name\nGorilla is the genus that is commonly used to refer to two species of great apes that are divided further into four total subspecies. The western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) is split into the western lowland gorilla with the scientific name Gorilla gorilla gorilla and the Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli). The eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) is comprised of the eastern lowland gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri), which is also known as the Grauer\u2019s gorilla, and the mountain gorilla with the scientific name Gorilla beringei beringei. These scientific names are typically abbreviated with initials for the genus and species while the subspecies is spelled out like G. g. gorilla.\nThese animals are members of the class Mammalia, the order Primates, and the family Hominidae. The term gorilla itself originates from a word in the ancient African local dialect along the west coast of the continent that translates roughly into a hairy person. This was first recorded by an explorer in the region over 2,500 years ago.\nGorilla Appearance and Behavior\nThis is an impressively strong animal, and its appearance backs that up. They possess thick chests with wide shoulders and an abdomen that is pushed forward. Adults have long, heavily muscled arms that they use to help propel themselves on their knuckles. Gorillas are covered in black fur except for their faces, hands, and feet; older males also have bare chests. Adult males develop gray or silver hairs in a saddle pattern on their lower back which is why mature males are often referred to as silverbacks. Mountain gorillas have noticeably longer hair than the other three species. Gorillas have truly unique skulls within the animal kingdom.\nMale gorillas can grow to nearly five and a half feet tall with their weight ranging between 300 and 485 pounds. Females generally stay below five feet tall and weigh 150 to 200 pounds. Gorillas living in captivity tend to grow fat and may be much heavier than their wild cousins. The largest recorded gorilla in captivity was Phil of the St. Louis Zoo who died weighing 776 pounds; that\u2019s bigger than a grizzly bear!\nDespite their reputation in the entertainment industry as aggressive, gorillas are actually quite shy unless threatened or harassed. They live in family groups ranging from six members up to 30 that are led by one or two related silverbacks. Generally, the leadership pair are father and son, but it is not uncommon for brothers to lead a troop. The remainder of the group is comprised of females, infants, and juveniles. They are active during the day and primarily move to feed.\nLearn more about the toughest animals in the world here.\nJurgen Vogt/Shutterstock.com\nGorilla Habitat\nWhile all gorillas inhabit the tropical forests of Africa, the specific habitat of gorillas varies widely depending on which of the subspecies you are talking about. The western lowland gorilla lives in the rainforests between Cameroon and the Congo River. The Cross River gorilla resides in only a small forest area between Nigeria and Cameroon directly on the Cross River. Grauer\u2019s gorilla lives in the rainforests of Congo, and the mountain gorilla lives in the mountain forests of the border region of Rwanda, Uganda, and Congo.\nA group of gorillas is called a troop or a band. A troop claims an area between one and 16 square miles, and they will walk short distances throughout that territory to feed. Several bands may inhabit the same area without conflict. They will build nests of vegetation every night either on the ground or in trees.\nGorilla Diet\nMost of these animals are vegetarian, but the western lowland gorilla also eats insects.\nWhat eats gorillas?\nThe short answer is not much. Leopards possess the ability to kill young animals, but they do not have many opportunities since the young rarely stray far from the adults. Scavengers will eat these animals who die from natural causes or injury, but there are no true predators for healthy gorillas.\nWhat does a gorilla eat?\nEastern gorillas thrive on leaves, shoots, and stalks of many different plants while western gorillas eat more fruit. The western lowland gorilla will smash open termite and ant mounds to eat the insects inside and has been know to eat snails as well. These animals can eat as much as 40 pounds of plant matter per day.\nIf you\u2019re looking for the full details on what gorillas eat, check out our \u2018What Do Gorillas Eat\u2018 guide!\nGorilla Predators and Threats\nAs mentioned earlier, the only true predator of these animals is a leopard. Leopards don\u2019t commonly hunt gorillas due to their sheer size and strength. It makes much more sense for them to focus on less dangerous prey.\nSadly, the greatest threat to these animals comes from humans. Exposure to disease, deforestation, trophy hunting, and even subsistence hunting to feed logging crews have all taken a terrible toll on the gorilla population. Since they share 98 percent of their DNA with humans, many of the diseases that affect our race are also faced by gorilla populations. That is why conservation efforts have focused on eliminating physical contact between humans and wild gorilla populations as their immune systems can\u2019t handle the diseases that humans transmit.\nGorilla Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nFemales reach sexual maturity around the age of seven or eight years old. Their gestational period is approximately eight and half months long. On average, they give birth to a sole baby every four years or so. Males mature more slowly, and they attain maturity between 12 and 13 years. Upon reaching maturity, males leave the troop and form their own with adult females that they kidnap from other bands during raids. The juveniles of the troop are all fathered by the one or two silverbacks that lead the group.\nA baby is entirely helpless from birth to around three months and spends a good amount of time being carried in its mother\u2019s arms. They also possess the ability to fiercely cling to their mother\u2019s chest or back, but they are not able to care for themselves or walk during that time. A baby gorilla weighs only four to five pounds at birth.\nWild gorillas live anywhere between 20 and 40 years while captive animals have been known to live well into their 40s. Until recently, the oldest known gorilla living in captivity was a female western lowland gorilla named Trudy. She died at the age of 63 in Little Rock Zoo in 2019. She was also believed to be the last captive gorilla in North America that was captured in the wild. As of 2021, a gorilla named Fatou is believed to be 64 years old. This makes Fatou the oldest gorilla in the world.\nGorilla Population\nAll species are currently considered to be critically endangered, and their populations are all in decline. Only 4,000 eastern lowland gorillas and 880 mountain gorillas are estimated to be in the wild. Of both of those groups, only 2,600 are mature adults. Approximately 300,000 western lowland gorillas are living, but they are experiencing a double-digit percentage population decline. Only 250 to 300 Cross River gorillas remain in a small region surrounding the Cross River.\nGorilla In the Zoo\nThese animals can be found in almost any major zoo. All gorillas in zoos in the United States are western lowland gorillas, and they were all born in captivity. None of these animals were captured in the wild. Both the Detroit Zoo and the Bronx Zoo are well known for their gorillas.\nView all 111 animals that start with G"}

The human race's need for sleep isn't up for debate\u2014it's universally accepted that we need sleep to survive\u2014but our biological purpose for doing so has remained somewhat of a mystery.

Even more importantly, a lack of sleep or poor sleep quality can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and even depression.\nA common question regarding non-human animals and sleep is the presence of dreams. Humans spend about two hours a night dreaming even if we can't remember most, or anything, about those dreams. Many researchers believe dreams exist to help us process our emotions; however, the purpose of dreaming remains a mystery.\nWhen it comes to sleep in animals, needs range greatly between different species.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Life Cycle of a Lion \u2013 From Cradle to Grave - Animal Hype", "url": "https://animalhype.com/mammals/life-cycle-lion/", "text": "When it comes to the wild animals of the jungle, no other animal is as beloved and majestic as the lion. The proud stance and the mane of the lion genuinely make it the king of the jungle. Though they belong to the family of apex predators, they are undeniably fragile against the brutal force of humanity.\nOver the years the population of lions has dwindled drastically, earning them a place in the vulnerable category of IUCN. Apart from all these, the lifestyle of lion pride is not favorable for the lion cubs. The lion cubs below the age of two have an 80% mortality rate. Yeah, it is not easy being a lion!\nThe life cycle of a lion starts with sexual reproduction and a lioness giving birth to cubs. The newborn cubs are blind and helpless, making them stay close to their mother for 2-3 months. The young lions start eating meat from the hunted prey only after three months. These young lions remain with pride until they reach sexual maturity, and once they attain sexual maturity, they leave the pride. The entire life cycle of a wild lion spans almost 8 to 10 years & while in captivity they can live up to 25 years of age.\nLion Life Cycle\nIn this article, we will have an in-depth look at the various stages in the life cycle of a lion. Let\u2019s get going.\nStage 1: The Birth of a Cub\nLions similar to other mammals give birth by sexual reproduction. Lions are not monogamous species, which means they may have multiple mates.\nLionesses are found to have an irregular reproductive cycle with fertile periods lasting anywhere between three to four days, unlike other mammals. When in heat, a lioness may mate with different lions in the pride as frequently as once in every thirty minutes.\nOnce pregnant lionesses gestate for about 110 days before giving birth to a litter of one to six cubs. The pregnant lionesses are found to seclude themselves from the pride and give birth to the cubs in a secluded den, which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area. The newborn cubs are kept away from the pride until they are old enough.\nThe newborn cubs are blind, helpless, and stay in the den close to their mother until they are 2 to 3 weeks old. Mother lionesses hunt alone in this duration in places that are near to their new den where the cubs are.\nThese cubs weigh 1.2\u20132.1 kg at the time of birth and begin to crawl in 2 to 3 days. It takes the cubs three weeks before it can start walking.\nBeing helpless, they are vulnerable to attacks by other predators. In order to avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-one.\nThough lionesses do all these, they aren\u2019t cautious mothers. Lionesses are seen to abandon their cubs for almost 24hrs straight causing a very high mortality rate of 80% among lion cubs under two years of age.\nStage 2: Being the new kids on the block \u2013 Introduction to the pride\nWhen the cubs are 6 to 8 weeks old, the mother lion introduces the cubs to their pride. The cubs aren\u2019t brave enough; in fact, they lack the confidence to be confronted by the other members of the pride.\nIt is seen that the lionesses in a pride synchronize their reproductive cycle to give birth to the cubs in almost the same time. In such cases, the cubs are introduced into the pride earlier.\nThese cubs slowly get acquainted with the lions in the pride and begin to play among themselves and with the other adult lions. Lionesses with cubs are seen to be more tolerant of the cubs than the male lions.\nNursing cubs in pride is riskier than nursing them in a separate den because pride is always vulnerable to an attack by other male lions who come challenging the existing males in the pride. If after a challenge the challenger wins, the new lion might kill the cubs in the pride. However, their mothers fight for them, often resulting in their own deaths.\nAt this age, the cubs do not eat meat; instead, they live off the milk from their mother. Cubs suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride.\nThis ensures that all the cubs in the pride grow equal in size. Though all these holds, lionesses are found to be careless mothers. They are found to leave the cubs alone for almost one full day before they come back in search of them.\nStage 3: Being the juveniles of the pride \u2013 The learning phase\nThe cubs stop suckling mother\u2019s milk when they are 2 to 3 months old. They then start feeding on meat like the rest of the adults in the pride. By now the cubs become capable of running, and they follow the lionesses when they go hunting. The cubs carefully observe the lionesses ambushing, chasing & pounding upon the prey, and taking it down.\nIt is important to note that in a pride of lions, only the females go hunting.\nBy the time cubs become six months old they will be very much acquainted with the customs of the pride and know the hunting tactics. These 6-month-old lionesses join the group of hunters and get their first hands-on experience in hunting down prey. Though they join the group of hunters, they are still dependent on their mother & pride for their survival.\nBy the time the juvenile lions become 15 to 18 months old, their mother might be pregnant. Some of the adolescent females may remain with the pride joining the elder lionesses while some others may wander off to find a mate or enter a new pride.\nSimilarly, the male lions may leave the pride by the time they are 18 months old while some might stick around till the age of 3 (When they attain sexual maturity) and take the pride from the aging males in the pride.\nStage 4: Forming a new pride\nMale lions attain sexual maturity when they are three years old. Those males who leave the pride when they are 18 months old usually remain as nomads till they reach sexual maturity.\nMost nomadic lions remain solitary with little opportunity to mate while others devote their adulthoods to attempting to take over a pride. Once they become mature, they begin their quest to form a pride.\nThe matured wanderer lions are found to team up and challenge the elder lions for taking over the pride. It is going to be a ferocious fight which is most often won by the challenger because the elder lions of the pride might be weak to hold ground against the gruesome attack of the young lions.\nWhen the challengers win and oust the previous males associated with the pride, they kill the cubs in the pride too. The counter-attack and defense by the lionesses are found to be futile against the powerful young males unless there is a group of 4 or 5 females to join forces to fight the male.\nFemales who lose their cubs quickly enter a new heat cycle, so they possibly breed with the male who killed her last litter.\nThe males do not like the idea of nurturing the cubs with genes of other males & they do not like the whole concept of being stepfathers.\nIt is believed that the new lions kill the existing cubs to make the females fertile because the lionesses are found to be non-receptive when they have cubs to take care of. Only less than 20% of the lion cubs survive until the age of two.\nWhen the new lions take over the pride the cubs are either killed or abandoned to be eaten by hyenas or cheetahs. Also, when the new lion takes over a pride, adolescent lions \u2013 both male and female \u2013 may be evicted.\nWhen the pride becomes too large, usually the youngest generation of female cubs are forced to leave to find their territory.\nStage 5: Old age\nLions are found to live up to 25 years in captivity. But you need to understand the fact that they are living outside their natural environment and are adequately taken care of including providing medical support whenever required.\nIn their natural habitats, lions are found to live till the age of 8 to 15. Most lions do not die of old age; instead, they succumb to their injuries. Every time a fight happens between male lions for a pride, life is lost. It is only a question of who falls first. The challenger or the challenged?\nLions are known for their brute strength and powerful bites that measure about 600psi. After the fight, one of the lions is ousted, and he might die of blood loss or serious injuries. The worst being heavily injured and dying out of starvation.\nAlso Read:\nLion Names\nDo Lions Eat Hyenas?\nSnail Life Cycle\nSilkworm Life Cycle"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Australian Animals - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Australian-animals.html", "text": "australian Animals\nAustralian animals are a fascinating group that includes some of the most unusual creatures on Earth.\nThe continent of Australia has vast expenses of desert and semi-arid land in its interior, sub-tropical rain forest in the Northeast, and grasslands and mountain ranges along the perimeter.\nApproximately 90% of the animals native to Australia are found nowhere else, including the kangaroo, koala, echidna, dingo, platypus, wallaby and wombat.\nAustralia is the smallest continent and is sometimes referred to as the worlds largest island. This relative isolation has created an ecology like no other.\nThe vast majority of Australian animals are marsupials - animals whose young develop in a pouch instead of a placenta. Australia is also home to the only egg-laying mammals in the world, the amazing echidna and the extraordinarily odd duckbill platypus.\nBats and dingos are the only placental mammals to have reached Australia on their own.\nDingos arrived from China via the Indonesian land bridge about 12,000 years ago and are the largest carnivores on the continent. Other dogs, cats, horses, cows, sheep and rabbits were all imported by human beings.\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nwhat is a marsupial?\nThere are three subclasses of mammals, placental mammals which carry their young in a womb with a placenta, and deliver a relatively full-formed infant, marsupials which do not have a placenta and deliver a relatively un-formed infant that continues its development inside an external pouch, nourishing itself with milk from the mothers mammary glands, and monotremes which lay eggs.(check them out).\nThe majority of animals native to Australia are marsupials, but what exactly is a marsupial, and how do they differ from other animals?\nSimply put, the embryo of a marsupial starts out life in the mothers womb, receiving nourishment from its egg sac, but is delivered very early and continues its development outside the mothers body.\nInstead of having a womb lined with a placenta that the egg attaches itself to and gains nourishment from, marsupials have no placenta and the baby must leave the womb, while still in a nearly embryonic state, to get nourishment from breast milk.\nThe baby, called a \"neonate\" at this stage, is born after only 12 to 28 days of development in the womb. It may be a fraction of an inch long in some species, is hairless, blind and has poorly developed rear legs.\nThe nostrils are open and the fully developed sense of smell is critical to the neonate finding its way. Its forelimbs are strong too, and raging instinct sets the neonate on a manic climb, unaided by the mother, across the sea of its mothers belly fur to reach the pouch.\nThis journey may be a distance of as much as 15 inches and require six minutes of continuous struggle. In a miracle of pure instinct, the almost imperceptible newborn arrives at the pouch, where it will attach itself to a teat and continue to develop for another 2 to 6 months.\nThe kangaroo\nAn icon of Australian wildlife and the nation itself, the kangaroo is the epitome of a marsupial.\nKangaroos are macropods, belonging in the family macropodidea, which literally means \"big feet\".\nThere are over 65 species in the family including red and grey kangaroos, wallabys, and pademelons. These animals are all designed with huge, powerful hind limbs and muscular tails that aid them in locomotion.\nWith its spacious, forward-facing pouch, curious hopping style of locomotion and a variety of other uniquely endearing features, the kangaroo sets the tone for all Australian wildlife.\nThe red kangaroo is the largest marsupial, and also the largest animal in Australia, with mature males weighing in at over 200 pounds and standing 6 feet tall. - Australian Animals\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

It is the only member of the family Phascolarctidae, the \"arct\" part of the family name from a Greek word meaning \"bear\", and there is definitely a \"bear-like\" quality to koalas, particularly in their lumbering movements and well-rounded, tailless bodies.\nPlush, fuzzy-eared, and with a sweet expression, koala bears are the darlings of Australian animals. They are tree-dwelling marsupials, who live the majority of their lives high in the limbs of eucalyptus forests.\nThey have a very limited diet that consists of the eucalyptus leaves of several different species of eucalyptus trees.. Eucalyptus leaves are toxic to many animals, but the koala has a section of intestine called the caecum which breaks down the toxins in its favorite food.\nBecause their diet is so limited and provides little nutrients, the koala bear is extremely sedentary, spending no more than 10 minutes a day in full-bodied exertion of any kind.\nThe koala bear is not social in the wild, and they are only seen in groups in preserves, zoos and game parks. The koala bear also has one of the smallest brains, percentage wise, of all mammals.\nthe tasmanian devil\nThe Tasmanian devil is a carnivorous marsupial with an epic reputation.\nThis is a very unique creature who has a lifestyle and manner of going about things that is entirely unique, not just among Australian wildlife, but among all animals.\nWildly vocal, the Tasmanian devil emits a constant deluge of guttural, gurgling, wailing and growling noises with little, if any, instigation.\nThe devil has an enormous head and neck which make up a full 25% of its total body mass. A relatively small animal at under 25 pounds, even the areas largest carnivore and apex predator the tough as nails dingo will not entertain any confrontation with a devil unless numbers are well in its favor.\nCompetition with the dingo for food, and attempted extermination of them as pests, has greatly impacted the devils population.\nAs of the early 1900's the devil can no longer be found on the continent of Australia , but now only exists on the island it is named for - Tasmania.\na few more australian Animals\nThe variety of Australian wildlife doesn't stop at koalas and kangaroos.\nThere are over 250 species of marsupials in Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand and the surrounding islands, the vast majority of which exist nowhere else in the world.\nThe bandicoot and bilby are local favorites and are comparable to squirrels and raccoons found in other parts of the world. The bilby is such a charismatic and popular little animal that Australians celebrate Easter with chocolate replicas of bilbys instead of rabbits.\nThe only egg-laying mammals in the world - the wildly bizzare duck billed platypus and the almost equally weird echidna exist only in Australia. These animals make up an entire subclass of mammals which lay leathery eggs instead of bearing live young.\nFinally, the beautiful dingo is the largest carnivore in Australia and the only placental mammal other than bats to have navigated to Australia naturally.\nDingos are the only large predator on the continent other than human beings and literally enjoy top-dog status among Australian animals. - Australian Animals Facts"}

It was 25% larger and much stronger than modern lions.\nAmerican lion was slightly smaller than large, heavily built saber-toothed cat, but it was much smarter. This fact is based on the brain size and less fossils found in the obviously dangerous sites such as tar pits.\nScientific name of American lion is \"Panthera leo atrox\", which means \"cruel lion\" in Latin.\nAmerican lion is also known as \"American cave lion\" because it shares many genetic similarities with extinct Eurasian cave lion.\nBased on the cave paintings, American lion was probably mane-less and covered with dark spots. It had thick coat suitable for cold weather.\nAmerican lion had 4-inches-long canine teeth (they were much larger in males), large, muscular body, very long, slender, but powerful front legs and retractable claws on the feet.\nAmerican lion was a carnivore. Its diet was based on the horses, deer, camels, sloths, mammoths and bison.\nAmerican lion was very fast animal. It was able to reach the speed of 30 miles per hour.\nAmerican lion had used powerful forelimbs with sharp claws to subdue its prey, before inflicting deadly wounds on the muzzle or throat, by using its long canine teeth.\nEstimated bite force of American lion is 1.800 pounds per square inch, which is two times stronger than a bite force of modern lion.\nAmerican lion was able to hunt alone and in pairs (to kill small animals), or in large groups (to kill large animals such as mammoths and bison).\nAmerican lion had used cave, canyons and overhanging cliffs as shelter.\nAmerican lion had no natural enemies.

The hind flippers are shorter and also have short claws at the ends of the digits.\nMale: Adult male California sea lions have a prominent sagittal (cranial) crest, making them easy to distinguish from females and immature males. Mature males also tend to be a much darker brown color and are substantially larger than adult females. Unlike many other species of sea lion, California sea lion males lack a well-defined mane.\nFemale: Mature females and immature males are light yellowish to tan in color and lack the prominent sagittal crest of the adult male.

Wing-like front flippers have a bone structure similar to that in our arms and hands. Swimming with these flippers propels the sea lion forward, while the hind flippers steer. Both pairs of flippers enable a sea lion to walk on land. Sea lions produce loud roars help explain why they're named after lions. Males of some sea lion species even grow thick manes around their necks. Most sea lion pups are born in late June. Pups are well developed at birth. Their eyes are open, they can vocalize, and even swim a little. Several days after the pup's birth, the mother leaves the pup in the crowded rookery as she searches for food in the ocean. When she returns, the mother emits a loud trumpeting vocalization, which elicits a bleating response from her pup. This exchange continues until the mother and pup find each other. She makes her final identification by smelling her pup. California sea lions are among the most gregarious marine mammals, forming dense aggregations of a thousand or more animals on land. They also may travel, socialize or rest at the surface in groups of ten or more near haul out areas.

Lions will only attack and eat crocodiles if the food is scarce. In addition, lions often end up devouring crocodiles if the croc tries to attack a lion\u2019s cub.\nIn the wilderness, these ferocious carnivores seldom pay attention to one another. Lions may occasionally hunt younger crocodiles, and older crocodiles may occasionally attack adult lions. Both predators seek to avoid one another because the potential for damage is too significant.\nDo lions actively hunt crocodiles?\nCrocodile running on grass\nNo, they do not hunt crocs actively. Most of these severe encounters occur for the carcass of the other species. It is not uncommon for food to be sparse in the wild for an extended length of time. As a response, lions would try to take carcasses from crocodiles anytime possible.\nAdult lions do not typically eat adult crocs.On the other hand, a crocodile may attempt to attack a lion cub, and a lioness could kill the crocodile. In addition, lions are frequently spotted chewing a cadaver in shallow water while surrounded by crocodiles.\nRelated Article: Why Do Crocodiles Open Their Mouths?\nHow can a lion kill a crocodile?\nWho comes out victorious from a battle between a lion and a crocodile is entirely dependent on the crocodile\u2019s size and surroundings.\nThe lion is among the largest feline on the planet, and it is bigger than most other cats. Only the tiger is bigger than a lion.\nA crocodile dies in a lion\u2019s attack by the riverbank. A lion is no match against a crocodile in the water. If the lion manages to injure the crocodile\u2019s eyes or pierces its head, the result for the crocodile is swift death.\nThe king of the jungle has the upper hand with its canine fangs. Crocodiles, on the other hand, havea powerful jaw. A crocodile\u2019s biting power is three times greater than a lion\u2019s. It is estimated to be at 3,700 pounds per square inch.\nLions know the power of a croc\u2019s bite. When lions pounce on crocodiles, they would encircle the crocodile and try to trap its head back. Often, but not always, a lion attacking from behind may try to turn the crocodile and grab it by the neck or gut. This generally results in deadly injuries.\nRelated Article: Do Crocodiles and Alligators Feel Pain?\nIs it possible for a younger crocodile to kill a full-grown lion?\nOrinoco Crocodile\nNo, it is not possible. A young crocodile does not possess the ability to attack a lion. Lions can easily manipulate crocodiles if they are by the riverbank.\nEven if crocodiles have strong scales as armor, which can protect them from the sharp claws of lions, lions attack the jugular. A younger crocodile can overpower a full-grown lion if the lion is injured.\nRelated Article: Do crocodiles have ears and how well can they hear?\nWho is deadlier, a lion or a crocodile?\nCrocodiles are deadlier. While sharks are frequently considered the most prevalent aquatic predator, crocodiles have always been 100 times more lethal. Their jaws are stronger than lions\u2019, and crocodiles have the advantage in the water.\nWho is more powerful in a fight, a lion or a crocodile?\nCrocodile in the sun\nThe Nile crocodile is one of the enormous crocodiles in the world. Its size ranges between 2400 and 2500 pounds. An older lion cannot defeat a crocodile this size in a one-on-one battle.\nIf the crocodile is young, there is no way it wins a fight. While a croc could gallop towards the water, it is too late to get to that safety if the lion made a move. A lion is fast, and it can outrun a crocodile.\nIt is easy for African lions to kill younger crocodiles. However, the result is never victorious for both predators when lions clash against fierce adult crocodiles.\nThe fight between these two predators might extend for hours at a time. These animals are fierce hunters who don\u2019t give up quickly.\nThe site of the fight, on the other hand, has a significant impact on the result of the battle. Lions are not good swimmers. When they want to hunt a croc, they do it on land.\nWhat would happen if a pride of female lions attacked crocodiles?\nDwarf Crocodile\nLions hunt in groups and execute a calculated group attack to hunt and eat an unaware crocodile. One lioness may divert its attention by biting the tail from behind, while another sneaks in and attacks the neck of a crocodile, choking it to death.\nCrocodiles are inflexible and slow on land due to their girth (in comparison to being incredibly swift in the water), making them vulnerable to lion assaults.\nHowever, those aren\u2019t the only instances in which lions eat crocodiles. In certain places of the world, lions become expert crocodile predators, hunting and eating crocodiles more than usual. In certain cases, crocodiles succeed against lions, while in others, lions dominate over crocodiles.\nAre lions smarter than crocodiles?\nTechnically, yes. Lions can solve puzzles, but crocs cannot. Crocodiles are opportunistic predators that ambush their targets. Lions work in a group to tire and overpower their prey. Both of these characteristics make these animals smart.\nIf the crocodile grabs the lion\u2019s paw in its jaws, it will quickly throw the lion into the sea while also killing it. Although lions are smarter and more powerful as a group, they must engage in a hard battle with the crocodile.\nThe lion hunts crocodiles on the ground to minimize failure.In most cases, lions are victorious in eliminating crocodiles; although they experience severe injuries, they can overpower crocodiles.\nCan an adult Nile crocodile kill a lion?\nCrocodile on land\nOn a one-one battle on land, it is not likely. A lion\u2019s primary weapons are its canines and claws, whereas a crocodile uses its armor, jaws, biting strength, tail in a battle with other animals.\nAn adult Nile crocodile can attack and kill a lion since its hunting style is so lethal. However, once a crocodile grabs a lion\u2019s throat in its jaws, the lionis in huge danger.\nSummary\nLions do not often prey on crocodiles because they are not the lion\u2019s primary food source. Lions do eat younger crocodiles. They prefer smaller crocodiles to maximize their chances of success. And if they come across a defenseless one, they will attack it. Both lions and crocodiles are powerful and cunning predators.\nSince they share the same environment, lions and crocodiles sometimes engage in carcass fights. Whenever these situations happen, lions can eat both the catch and the crocodile."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Rhino Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Rhino-facts.html", "text": "rhino Facts\nPortrait of a White Rhino\nThe rhino is the second largest land animal after the elephant. They have thick, bare skin, which is sometimes arranged over their bodies like plates of armor, barrel-like bodies, gigantic heads, and incredible horns protruding from their faces.\nThe mass is supported by short, stout legs and wide feet that have three both front and rear. Each individual toe ends in a hoof, which leave a footprint that looks like the Ace of clubs.\nThese animals have remained unchanged for thousands of years, so the resemblance to dinosaurs like triceratops is intriguing, but their closest relatives are actually tapirs and horses.\nThere are 5 species of rhinoceros, 3 living in Asia, and 2 in Africa. All rhino species are endangered, except for one subspecies of white rhino, which has recently been brought back from the brink of extinction.\nThe most familiar rhinoceros species are the black rhino and the white rhino, but both of these animals are actually grey in color. The term \"white\" stems from a misinterpretation of the word \"wide\" describing the shape of the white rhinos mouth, and the black rhino is so called because it is often the color of the mud it covers itself with.\nThe African rhinos can be 6 feet tall at the shoulder and average about 3000 pounds. They have massive, low-slung heads that feature unusually forward eye placement, and long, sharp, dramatic looking horns.\nThe word rhinoceros basically means \"nose horn\" in Latin.\nThe white, black and Javan rhinos have two horns, while the Indian (also known as the greater one-horned) and Sumatran, (also known as the hairy rhinoceros), have one. These horns are made of keratin, like human nails, and grow out of the skin in a similar fashion.\nRhinos are intimidating looking creatures, and will charge when confronted or threatened, but they are not generally aggressive towards humans, and only 2 or 3 attacks are reported a year. In comparison, fatalities from elephant attacks number 400 to 500 a year, and hippos kill about 2,900 people annually!\nThe Asian rhinos in particular, are shy, reclusive, and even timid.\nThe rhinoceros is strictly vegetarian, grazing on grasses or browsing trees and shrubs for leaves, shoots and fruits. They are mostly solitary, especially when feeding, since their food intake of 40 to 80 pounds of vegetation a day, requires them to spread out.\nSmall social groups do form, consisting of females and their young, or young males banding together, and herds of as many as 30 individuals may be created near water sources during drought conditions.\nWallowing in mud is somewhat of a social event as well, and favorite spots may attract large numbers of rhinos at a time, but generally, they are not gregarious. - Rhino Facts\nrhino lifestyle\nwhite rhinoceros\nblack rhinoceros\nThe white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros live in small pockets of grasslands on the floodplains of Southern and Eastern Africa. Because of their size they require a home range of about 5 square miles that is rich in resources.\nAbundant vegetation is vital to survival, but unlike many African animals who regularly go for many days without drinking, the water from the plants rhinos eat is not sufficient for them, and they will visit watering holes multiple times a day, drinking heartily.\nDuring drought, they may have to walk up to ten miles between their water source and their food source.\nWet areas also supply them with muddy banks that they will wallow and bathe in, coating their sensitive skin with mud as protection from heat and insect bites.\nRhinoceros skin is a paradox. It can be an inch thick in some areas to protect them from battles with other rhinos, but it is actually very soft, and subject to sores and sunburn.\nThe black rhinoceros is particularly prone to inflamed red areas of skin called \"rhino sores\". Usually forming in the region of skin behind the front legs, rhino sores are parasitic infestations of tiny worms living just below the skin.\nRhinoceroses spend over 12 hours a day foraging and grazing across their territory. They are both nocturnal and diurnal, being most active at dawn and dusk, and alternating a few hours each of feeding and resting throughout the day and night. During the hottest seasons, they will feed mostly at night, and rest and wallow in the heat of the day.\nThe white rhino is by far the most social species, often seen in small communal herds of 5 to 10 individuals, and it is believed that loss of territory is forcing them to become more and more tolerant of each other.\nBlack rhinos are far less gregarious, and are also the most pugnacious of the rhino species. Adult male black rhinos can be quite territorial and may battle to the death.\nAlthough the rhinos within a given area may not see or socialize with each other much, they use communal dung heaps that act as message boards. Both males and females will relieve themselves in these areas, usually kicking around in the pile to spread their scent.\nRhinos have very poor eyesight, but excellent senses of smell and hearing. They are fairly vocal as well, with approximately 10 to 12 specific snorts and calls of warning, greeting, excitement, anger and delight.\n- Amazing Rhino Facts\nrhino reproduction\nblack rhino mother and baby\nwhite rhino mother and baby\nDominant male rhinos establish territories by marking the perimeters with urine and dung, and actively defending the area against other aggressive males.\nA large number of male rhinoceroses, although sexually mature, take a subordinate role in rhino society, and are tolerated by dominant males so long as they display submissive behavior. These males may never even attempt to establish a territory, and will never have the opportunity to mate.\nThe female rhinos home range may overlap several male rhinos territories. She and her youngsters freely move throughout these areas, and females themselves are not generally territorial with other females.\nShe comes into estrous several times a year, and males can detect her condition through the scent of her urine.\nDominant males will follow and court her, attempting to herd her into their territory. Once there, the male may try to keep her close until she is willing to mate. At this time, males may become extremely aggressive with each other, and violent fights may occur.\nWhite, black and Indian rhinos have courtship rituals that involve males and females sparring with each other. The Javan and Sumatran rhinos are so shy and rare, that very little is known about their reproductive habits.\nOnce the female accepts a males overtures, the pair may stay together for a few days or even weeks, even sleeping in close contact. Or, the mating may be over in just a few hours, and she may go on to mate with other males during the same period.\nThe female is pregnant for approximately 16 months. When she is close to delivering she will drive off any youngster she currently has.\nThe birth may take place standing or lying down, and the newborn rhino is gigantic, weighing anywhere from 75 to 150 pounds.\nThe baby is born without a horn, which begins to grow within a few weeks, but is otherwise a miniature adult.\nTheir eyes are open, they are vocal, and they stand and nurse within minutes. Rhino calves begin to sample solid foods at just a week or two old, and are generally weaned at 2 years. They grow very quickly over the first few months of life, gaining as much as 5 pounds in a day!\nWhen traveling, white rhino calves usually walk in front of their mother, probably because, with her poor eyesight, she can keep track of it better. Black rhino calves, however, always follow behind. This may be because the black rhino lives in heavier vegetation, and the mother must clear the way for her calf.\nYoung rhinos are raised by their mothers only, and will stay with her for 2 to 5 years, until she is ready to give birth to a new baby.\nJuveniles that have been driven off by their mothers may band together in pairs or little groups until they reach sexual maturity at 3 to 6 years. Females usually have their first birth at 5 or 6 years old. Most males will not attempt to claim their own territory until they are at least 10 years old.\nRhinos reach full size, including full horn length, at about 8 years old, but males may continue to fill out for another 3 to 4 years, sometimes reaching 15 feet in total length, and weighing 6,000 pounds at the high end for white rhinos. - Rhino Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Many more are fined or imprisoned. But the trade remains a healthy one, and international efforts may not be enough to save the rhino in the wild.\nThe rhinoceros horn, like a human nail, will grow back in a few years if cut off, so some groups are choosing to tranquilize and de-horn adult rhinos. The operation is done with a chainsaw, and a large amount of the horns base, where nerve endings are still present, must remain in order not to harm the animal.\nWhile most poachers kill rhinos outright in order to remove the horn, even if they were to tranquilize, they will not leave any priceless horn material behind, and the animal would still die.\nFurthermore, in areas where dehorning is carried out by conservation groups, the poachers will kill de-horned individuals anyway, so that they don't waste time and resources tracking the same animal again. - Rhino Facts\nrhinos!\nThe white rhino\nsouthern white rhino\nThe largest of all the rhinos, the white rhino can reach over 6 feet at the shoulder, 15 feet in length and 6,000 pounds! But the white rhino isn't white, it is grey.\nThe assumption is that the term \"white\" came from a misinterpretation of the word \"wide\", referring to the animals wide, squared-off lips. The species is also known as the square-lipped, or wide-lipped rhino, and the lip shape is the easiest way to identify the species\nThis is a grazing animal, built with a gigantic, downward dangling head, that is just long enough to mow the ground, with methodical, side to side sweeping motions. The top lip is soft and mobile while the bottom lip is stiffer and serves to shear grass blades very close to the ground.\nThe head of the white rhinoceros is proportionately larger than that of the other species, allowing it to comfortably graze for hours on end, and there is a corresponding shoulder hump of powerful muscles to support it.\nWhen turning around in tight spots they will rotate their rear ends around their front legs in a movement reminiscent of a tractor trailer, but out in the open, and when moving in a straight line, they can be quite swift, with a powerful, and even graceful trotting gate.\nThere are two subspecies of white rhinoceros. At an estimated 20,000 wild individuals, the Southern white rhino is the most populous of all rhino subspecies, while the Northern white rhino is extinct in the wild, and is, as of 9/16, represented by only 3 captive individuals.\nThese 3 precious animals, 1 male and 2 females, are kept under armed guard at Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a sanctuary in Kenya.\nAttempts are being made to save the Northern white rhinoceros through in-vitro fertilization, but time is running out.\nWhite rhinoceroses live on the grassy plains of Africa, and are specialized eaters. They mow grass blades close to the ground, massive mouth fulls at a time, with their broad muzzles and strong lip pads.\nThey are a bit more social than other species, and confrontations tend to be more ritualized and less violent. Dominant males maintain territories but allow submissive males to pass through without much incident. Females move through the territories of numerous males, and females with young will occasionally travel together.\nAdult white rhinos have no natural predators, but juveniles may be taken by lions, hyenas and crocodiles. - White Rhino Facts\nthe black rhino\nblack rhinoceros covered with mud\nThe third largest of all rhino species, the black rhino can be 5 1/2 feet at the shoulder, 12 1/5 feet long and over 3,000 pounds.\nThe origin of their name isn't really understood, because, like the white rhino, the black rhinos skin is also grey. In fact, there really isn't any difference between their average skin color of the black and white rhinos, but it is possible that the mud black rhinos cover themselves with is darker, overall, in the areas that they live, occasionally making them appear black, or ashy in color.\nBlack rhinos are mostly solitary, with adult males staying almost exclusively by themselves, and females co-mingling mostly just with their own offspring.\nThe individuals in a particular range are called a \"clan\", and the dominant males will maintain territories whose boundaries overlap. When two males meet, they may engage in ritualistic horn wrestling, which allows for a test of strength, without the risk of injury or death.\nBlack rhinos are designed for foraging, not grazing. They don't require open grasslands, but instead live in more rugged terrain, often hilly, rocky or wooded. They make trails throughout their range that tunnel directly through the brush, and will simply crash through vegetation when no trails are present.\nBlack rhinos have much smaller heads than the white rhinos, and so don't have a prominent shoulder hump. They have a more forward head placement that puts their mouths in line with the low shrubs and bushes they feed on.\nA pointed, prehensile upper lip, that almost resembles a birds beak, curls around shoots, leaves and fruits, and pulls them into the mouth. Because of this feature, the black rhinoceros is often referred to as the \"hook-lipped\" rhino.\nThe black rhino has a reputation for being a far more dangerous animal than the white rhino, but its habitat may be part of the reason, since most rhino attacks occur when the rhino is startled, and the black rhino lives in much denser areas where visibility may be limited.\nThe adult black rhinoceros has no natural predators, but elephants will often run them off, and mature female elephants, for whatever reason, are often intolerant of them.\nViolent confrontations between black rhinos and African elephants have been documented, with fatalities reported on both sides. - Black Rhino Facts\nthe indian rhino\nIndian Rhinoceros\nThe Indian rhino is more recently being referred to as the \"Great one-horned\" or \"Great Indian one-horned\", or simply \"One-horned\" rhinoceros. In the past, it was regularly referred to as the Asian rhino.\nThis is the second largest rhino species, but is sometimes considered the largest. Indian rhinos are, on average, taller than white rhinos, often at 6 1/2 feet at the shoulder, but white rhinos tend to be heavier, and the largest individuals recorded are white rhinos.\nThe Indian rhino has a single horn on its muzzle, and incredible, thickly folded skin, that absolutely looks like a full coat of armor. The skin even has numerous warty bumps, called tubercles, across the shoulders and flanks that look like rivets, and the effect is positively amazing.\nDespite its aggressive appearance, the Great one-horned rhino is a relatively peaceful creature, with very little of the territorial jousting that occurs among the more familiar black and white rhinos of Africa.\nIn fact, the Indian rhino doesn't even use its single 2 foot long horn in battle. If they do have confrontations, they use their large, tusk-like lower incisor teeth, to bite or jab their opponent.\nIndian rhinos eat both grass and brush, and so their lips are less pointed than the black rhino, but still have a small prehensile tip. They spend evenings and mornings feeding, and hot afternoons wallowing in swampy areas.\nThe indian rhino is mostly solitary, only coming together to mate. Babies are particular large, and are rarely under 125 pounds at birth.\nThis is an endangered species that has experienced an amazing comeback over the last several decades. With population estimates at less than 600 individuals in 1975, they have regained a solid foothold with well over 3,000 animals as of 2016.\nThe citizens and governments of Nepal and Indian have achieved an unprecedented conservation success, and continue to monitor and defend these incredible animals in the wild. - Indian Rhino Facts\nthe sumatran rhino\nSumatran Rhinoceros\nThe Sumatran rhino is the smallest of the five rhino species, with individuals rarely reaching 10 feet in length or more than 4 1/2 to 5 feet at the shoulder.\nThese rhinos have a reddish brown color, and can have quite a bit of hair, particularly on the legs and belly. The hair tends to disperse as the animals mature, and older Sumatran rhinos also tend to loose the reddish tinge.\nSumatran rhinos are solitary and secretive, living at higher elevations than the other species, in tropical rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo. They have been recorded at altitudes of up to 6,500 feet, but logging ventures have depleted their available territory, and the future looks bleak for these fascinating creatures.\nThey are very critically endangered with only 80 to 100 individuals believed living in the wild as of 2016. There are some specimens living in Zoos, but they do not thrive in captivity, and many have perished, even under expert care.\nSumatran rhinos are rather primitive, and are most closely related to the extinct whoolly rhino, a common ancestor of the Asian rhino species.\nSumatran rhinos live in heavily forested and hilly terrain, and are remarkably adept climbers, pushing through the gnarliest brush, and straight up slopes too steep for a person to climb except on all fours.\nThey create tunnel like pathways through the thickest undergrowth, that remain for other animals to utilize.\nThey are far more likely to be heard in the wild than seen, because of the impenetrable nature of their jungle environment, and because they are reported to be very vocal, snorting, chirping and chortling to themselves as they go about their day. - Sumatran Rhino Facts\nThe Javan Rhino\nJavan Rhinoceros\nWith its single horn and heavily pleated skin, the Javan rhino, also known as the Lesser one-horned rhino, looks and acts very much like the Indian rhino.\nThe Javan rhino has a small head by rhino standards, and the horn is also small, rarely reaching more than 10 inches. Females don't usually develop a pronounced horn at all, but the base is present.\nThe Javan rhino is one of the rarest large mammals in the world. In 2016 less than 50 individuals survive in Indonesia\u2019s Ujung Kulon National Park, on the island of Java. These few are the only population left in the world, and none exist in zoos.\nThe Javan rhinoceros once existed throughout Cambodia, Sumatra, Thailand and Vietnam, but the last wild individual outside of Java was poached in Vietnam in 2010.\nVietnam is the largest consumer of rhino products, for medicinal, spiritual and ritualistic purposes, which are not only made from the horn, but from hide, hooves, blood and urine. Even rhino ears and tails are highly prized in Vietnam, so the Javan rhinos small horn, or the lack of a horn on Java rhino females, did not protect them from extreme poaching.\nOne encouraging point about poaching in Nepal and throughout Asia, is a trend since the late 1980's towards the use of liquid and powdered rhinoceros urine in place of rhino blood, for medicines to treat asthma, lung ailments and fever.\nSome zoos and nature preserves collect the urine and supply it for free, which may have an impact on poaching. - Javan Rhino Facts\na few more rhino facts\nWhite rhinos and Black rhinos are both actually grey in color\nWhite rhinos are probably called \"white\" due to a misinterpretation of the word for \"wide\" referring to their wide, straight lips.\nThe Black rhino may be called black because they often cover themselves with very dark mud.\nThe largest rhino horns can be over 4 feet in length!\nRhinoceros skin is over an inch thick in some parts of the body\nRhinos are not nearly as dangerous as they look, and only about 3 attacks a year are reported.\nIt is occasionally suggested that rhinos have \"extra ribs\", but they actually have 18 pairs, which is the same number of ribs that horses have.\nWhite Rhino Mother and Calf"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Barbary lion - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_lion", "text": "Extinct lion population in North Africa\nThe Barbary lion, also called the North African lion, Berber lion, Atlas lion, and Egyptian lion, is a Panthera leo leo population that is extinct in the wild. It lived in the mountains and deserts of the Barbary Coast of North Africa, from Morocco to Egypt. It was eradicated following the spread of firearms and bounties for shooting lions. A comprehensive review of hunting and sighting records revealed that small groups of lions may have survived in Algeria until the early 1960s, and in Morocco until the mid-1960s. Today, it is locally extinct in this region.\nUntil 2017, the Barbary lion was considered a distinct lion subspecies. Results of morphological and genetic analyses of lion samples from North Africa published in 2008 showed that the Barbary lion does not differ significantly from lion samples collected in West and northern parts of Central Africa. It falls into the same phylogeographic group as the Asiatic lion, and is also closely related to lion populations in West Africa.\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\nBarbary lion zoological specimens range in colour from light to dark tawny. Male lion skins had manes of varying colouration and length. Head-to-tail length of stuffed males in zoological collections varies from 2.35 to 2.8 m (7 ft 8+1\u20442 in to 9 ft 2 in), and of females around 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in). Skull size varied from 30.85 to 37.23 cm (1 ft 0.15 in to 1 ft 2.66 in). Some manes extended over the shoulder and under the belly to the elbows. The mane hair was 8 to 22 cm (3.1 in to 8.7 in) long.\nIn 19th century hunter accounts, the Barbary lion was claimed to be the largest lion, with a weight of wild males ranging from 270 to 300 kg (600 to 660 lb). Yet, the accuracy of such data measured in the field is questionable. Captive Barbary lions were much smaller but kept under such poor conditions that they might not have attained their full potential size and weight.\nThe colour and size of lions' manes was long thought to be a sufficiently distinct morphological characteristic to accord a subspecific status to lion populations. Mane development varies with age and between individuals from different regions, and is therefore not a sufficient characteristic for subspecific identification. The size of manes is not regarded as evidence for Barbary lions' ancestry. Instead, results of mitochondrial DNA research support the genetic distinctness of Barbary lions in a unique haplotype found in museum specimens that is thought to be of Barbary lion descent. The presence of this haplotype is considered a reliable molecular marker to identify captive Barbary lions. Barbary lions may have developed long-haired manes, because of lower temperatures in the Atlas Mountains than in other African regions, particularly in winter. Results of a long-term study on lions in Serengeti National Park indicate that ambient temperature, nutrition and the level of testosterone influence the colour and size of lion manes.\nTaxonomic history [ edit ]\nP. l. leo and P. l. melanochaita Map shows range ofand\nFelis leo was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a type specimen from Constantine, Algeria. Following Linnaeus's description, several lion zoological specimens from North Africa were described and proposed as subspecies in the 19th century:\nIn 1930, Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the lion to the genus Panthera, when he wrote about the Asiatic lion.\nIn the 20th and early 21st centuries, there has been much debate and controversy among zoologists on lion classification and validity of proposed subspecies:\nGenetic research [ edit ]\nResults of a phylogeographic analysis using samples from African and Asiatic lions was published in 2006. One of the African samples was a vertebra from the National Museum of Natural History (France) that originated in the Nubian part of Sudan. In terms of mitochondrial DNA, it grouped with lion skull samples from the Central African Republic, Ethiopia and the northern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nWhile the historical Barbary lion was morphologically distinct, its genetic uniqueness remained questionable. In a comprehensive study about the evolution of lions in 2008, 357 samples of wild and captive lions from Africa and India were examined. Results showed that four captive lions from Morocco did not exhibit any unique genetic characteristic, but shared mitochondrial haplotypes with lion samples from West and Central Africa. They were all part of a major mtDNA grouping that also included Asiatic lion samples. Results provided evidence for the hypothesis that this group developed in East Africa, and about 118,000 years ago traveled north and west in the first wave of lion expansion. It broke up within Africa, and later in West Asia. Lions in Africa probably constitute a single population that interbred during several waves of migration since the Late Pleistocene. Genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion specimen from Sudan clustered with P. l. leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to P. l. melanochaita.\nFormer distribution and habitat [ edit ]\nThe last photograph of a wild lion in the Atlas Mountains, taken by Marcelin Flandrin on a flight from Casablanca to Dakar in 1925\nHistorical sighting and hunting records from the 19th and 20th centuries show that the Barbary lion inhabited Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub. The westernmost sighting of a Barbary lion reportedly occurred in the Anti-Atlas in western Morocco. It ranged from the Atlas Mountains and the Rif in Morocco, the Ksour and Amour Ranges in Algeria to the Aur\u00e8s Mountains in Tunisia. In Algeria, the Barbary lion was sighted in the forested hills and mountains between Ouarsenis in the west to the Chelif River plains in the north and the Pic de Taza in the east. It inhabited the forests and wooded hills of the Constantine Province southward into the Aur\u00e8s Mountains.\nIn the 1830s, lions may have already been eliminated along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and near human settlements. In Libya, the Barbary lion persisted along the coast until the beginning of the 18th century, and was extirpated in Tunisia by 1890. By the mid-19th century, the Barbary lion population had massively declined, since bounties were paid for shooting lions. The cedar forests of Chelia and neighbouring mountains in Algeria harboured lions until about 1884. The Barbary lion disappeared in the B\u00f4ne region by 1890, in the Khroumire and Souk Ahras regions by 1891, and in Batna Province by 1893. The last recorded shooting of a wild Barbary lion took place in 1942 near Tizi n'Tichka in the Moroccan part of the Atlas Mountains. A small remnant population may have survived in remote montane areas into the early 1960s. The last known sighting of a lion in Algeria occurred in 1956 in Beni Ourtilane District.\nHistorical accounts indicate that in Egypt lions occurred in the Sinai Peninsula, along the Nile, in the Eastern and Western Deserts, in the region of Wadi El Natrun and along the maritime coast of the Mediterranean. In the 14th century BC, Thutmose IV hunted lions in the hills near Memphis. The growth of civilizations along the Nile and in the Sinai Peninsula by the beginning of the second millennium BC and desertification contributed to isolating lion populations in North Africa.\nBehaviour and ecology [ edit ]\nIn the early 20th century, when Barbary lions were rare, they were sighted in pairs or in small family groups comprising a male and female lion with one or two cubs. Between 1839 and 1942, sightings of wild lions involved solitary animals, pairs and family units. Analysis of these sightings indicate that lions retained living in prides even when under increasing persecution, particularly in the eastern Maghreb. The size of prides was likely similar to prides living in sub-Saharan habitats, whereas the density of the Barbary lion population is considered to have been lower than in moister habitats.\nWhen Barbary stag (Cervus elaphus barbarus) and gazelles became scarce in the Atlas Mountains, lions preyed on herds of livestock that were carefully tended. They also preyed on wild boar (Sus scrofa).\nSympatric predators in this region included the African leopard (P. pardus pardus) and Atlas bear (Ursus arctos crowtheri).\nIn captivity [ edit ]\nThe lions kept in the menagerie at the Tower of London in the Middle Ages were Barbary lions, as shown by DNA testing on two well-preserved skulls excavated at the Tower between 1936 and 1937. The skulls were radiocarbon-dated to around 1280\u20131385 and 1420\u22121480. In the 19th century and the early 20th century, lions were often kept in hotels and circus menageries. In 1835, the lions in the Tower of London were transferred to improved enclosures at the London Zoo on the orders of the Duke of Wellington.\nThe lions in the Rabat Zoo exhibited characteristics thought typical for the Barbary lion. Nobles and Berber people presented lions as gifts to the royal family of Morocco. When the family was forced into exile in 1953, the lions in Rabat, numbering 21 altogether, were transferred to two zoos in the region. Three of these were shifted to a zoo in Casablanca, with the rest being shifted to Mekn\u00e8s. The lions at Mekn\u00e8s were moved back to the palace in 1955, but those at Casablanca never came back. In the late 1960s, new lion enclosures were built in Temara near Rabat. Results of a mtDNA research revealed in 2006 that a lion kept in the German Zoo Neuwied originated from this collection and is very likely a descendant of a Barbary lion. Five lion samples from this collection were not Barbary lions maternally. Nonetheless, genes of the Barbary lion are likely to be present in common European zoo lions, since this was one of the most frequently introduced subspecies. Many lions in European and American zoos, which are managed without subspecies classification, are most likely descendants of Barbary lions. Several researchers and zoos supported the development of a studbook of lions directly descended from the King of Morocco's collection.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the Addis Ababa Zoo kept 16 adult lions. With their dark, brown manes extending through the front legs, they looked like Barbary or Cape lions. Their ancestors were caught in southwestern Ethiopia as part of a zoological collection for Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia.\nCultural significance [ edit ]\nThe lion appeared frequently in early Egyptian art and literature. Statues and statuettes of lions found at Hierakonpolis and Koptos in Upper Egypt date to the Early Dynastic Period. The early Egyptian deity Mehit was depicted with a lion head. In Ancient Egypt, the lion-headed deity Sekhmet was venerated as protector of the country. She represented destructive power, but was also regarded as protector against famine and disease. Lion-headed figures and amulets were excavated in tombs in the Aegean islands of Crete, Euboea, Rhodes, Paros and Chios. They are associated with Sekhmet and date to the early Iron Age between the 9th and 6th centuries BC. The remains of seven mostly subadult lions were excavated at the necropolis Umm El Qa'ab in a tomb of Hor-Aha, dated to the 31st century BC. In 2001, the skeleton of a mummified lion was found in the tomb of Ma\u00efa in a necropolis dedicated to Tutankhamun at Saqqara. It had probably lived and died in the Ptolemaic period, showed signs of malnutrition and had probably lived in captivity for many years.\nBarbary Lion in colosseum of Rome\nIn Roman North Africa, lions were regularly captured by experienced hunters for venatio spectacles in amphitheatres.\nMorocco national football team is called \"Atlas Lions\", and the supporters are usually seen wearing T-shirts with a lion's face or wearing a lion suit.\nSee also [ edit ]"}

One in Ethiopia resulted in the death of 35 hyenas and 6 lions.\nIf you want to learn all about who wins in a fight between a lion and a hyena, then you\u2019re in the right place.\nKeep reading!\nWho Wins a Fight Between a Lion and a Hyena?\nAnimals use aggression as a means of communication.\nSeveral factors are responsible for aggressive interactions among animal species, the two most important are territory and food.\nThe traditional rule in the wild is \u201csurvival of the fittest,\u201d and all animals use any possible means to win the battle for life.\nThis necessity results in violent clashes, which may involve the death of one of the combatants.\nThe epic struggle for survival is being waged continuously in all ecosystems around the world.\nWho Are the Natural Rivals of Lions?\nLions are apex predators.\nAn apex is a peak, or a top, in Latin.\nApex predators are at the top of the food chain and do not have natural predators in their environment.\nDo lions, generally considered as the kings of the jungle, actually face competition? The answer is: Yes.\nThere are a number of animals in the natural world that could be considered self-styled kings in their own right. These include:\nAfrican elephant\nCrocodile\nGorilla\nGrizzly bear\nHippopotamus\nHyenas\nLeopard\nSiberian tiger\nTiger\nWild dogs\nWolf\nSome of them may not be direct competitors of lions, but they are still strong rivals.\nWho Are the Two Main Rivals in the African Savannah of a Lion?\nHave you ever seen a rebellious and ferocious animal battling the \u201cking of the jungle\u201d for dominance?\nThis can be a routine occurrence throughout the African savannah ecosystem; that is, the great lion is challenged constantly by hyenas.\nBut, before we dig deep into their hostility, let\u2019s get a brief introduction to these two main rivals.\nWho Are the Hyenas?\nImagine the most intelligent and successful hunters in Africa. You are probably thinking of lions\u2026 right? No. Believe it or not, this honor goes to the hyenas.\nThese odd-looking animals are perhaps the most ignored and little-known competitors to the big African cats. They are also the most common carnivores in all of Africa.\nHere are some important facts about these amazing animals:\nThey don\u2019t belong to a cat or dog family and are unique enough to have their own family, the Hyaenidae.\nThere are three distinct species of hyenas: brown, striped, and spotted. The largest population among these are the spotted hyenas.\nSpotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are found mainly in Africa. Their length is approximately 4.25 ft. (130 cm), weighing between 110-190 pounds (50-86 kg.).\nTheir large head and strong teeth and jaws aid them in catching prey and crushing bones.\nThey have dark eyes, pointed ears, and thick muzzles.\nTheir ears, throat, and muzzle are almost entirely black, but the coat color may be gray, golden yellow, or brown.\nTheir most unusual feature has to be their legs. The front legs of hyenas appear larger when compared to their hind legs. This peculiar feature makes them look as if they are limping uphill. However, the front legs only appear longer. This is because they are heavily muscled around their neck and shoulders. They use this well-placed strength to their advantage during predation.\nWho Are the Lions?\nWho doesn\u2019t know lions? Lions (Panthera leo) are the traditional \u2018kings\u2019 of the savannah ecosystem.\nVarious subspecies are known, but we will only discuss the African lions here. They are master hunters and perhaps the most powerful of the large cats.\nTheir physical features are majestic and impressive. An average male African lion is about 6-6.8 ft. (183-207 cm.) long and can weigh around 411.3-496 pounds (186-225 kg.).\nSexual dimorphism is distinct, and males are comparatively larger than females.\nMales have a majestic mane on their necks. Due to their unique lifestyle and ability to hunt almost every animal, they have been styled in human lore as the \u201ckings of the jungle.\u201d\nIs There a Rivalry Between Lions and Hyenas?\nSo we need to unpack the facts about these two formidable rivals. The question becomes, who really is the master of the savannah: the lion or the hyenas?\nBelow we will discuss how the two rivals stack up against each other.\nWho Is the Better Hunter: Lion or Hyena?\nWho are better hunters among these rivals? You might be surprised by the answer because it\u2019s the hyenas.\nThey are more successful hunters than the fabled lions. Their hunting success rate in groups can be as high as 74%, while the success rate of lions hardly exceeds 30%.\nWhat Causes the Rivalry Between Lions and Hyenas?\nThese two animals usually compete for common resources, such as food and space. The rivalry between the lions and hyenas is related to the fact that both hunt almost the same animals.\nAlthough the hyenas are better known as scavengers, they are also competent hunters.\nTherefore, the hyenas can become a nuisance for the lions when they interfere with hunting attacks or steal the lion\u2019s kill.\nHow Dangerous Are Hyenas?\nThe hyenas possess several dangerous behaviors which can frighten even the fearless lions.\nHyenas are much more aggressive when consuming their kill. Some might even call it greedy. They rarely leave much of their victims, often consuming all of their flesh and bones. However, they are unwilling to eat hooves, hair, and horns.\nTheir excellent night vision allows them to hunt in the dark.\nA single hyena is not troublesome for male African lions. However, since hyenas usually attack in groups, they can pose a powerful threat. Hyenas often run in groups of sometimes around a dozen animals which are called hyena clans.\nTheir physical features allow them to camouflage themselves easily into the dry and large grasses of savanna.\nHyenas can be pretty good fighters in a one-on-one battle. They have been known to defeat baboons and honey badgers in such duels.\nAre Lions Fearful of Hyenas?\nWhat makes a lion fearful of these much smaller animals? Other animals also fear hyenas.\nWhat strikes such fear in so many animals, including lions, is that hyenas almost always fight in groups.\nIn a group attack, they outnumber a lion by a heavy margin and can tear it to pieces.\nWhat makes it worse is noticing a single hyena is a sure sign that there are probably many more in the vicinity.\nWhat is even more frustrating for a lion is that hyenas can usually withstand an attack by a lion.\nHowever, hyenas are highly aggressive when it comes to defending their territories.\nA single big cat, such as a lion, can easily be killed if it is unfortunate to walk straight into their territory.\nA hyena\u2019s effectiveness is also enhanced by the communication between clan members, which helps them make a coordinated attack.\nCan a Hyena Kill a Lion?\nNow let\u2019s imagine a duel between a hyena and a lion. Both have strong claims to the throne.\nWho would win such a fight?\nThe lion (and even lioness) will not lose to an animal half of its size. Right?\nBecause hyenas have neither the speed nor the agility of a tiger nor the size and strength of the elephant, a hyena stands little chance against a lion in a one-on-one duel.\nThe lion often emerges victorious in such an encounter.\nThe supremely powerful built and aerodynamically balanced moves of the lion are more than a hyena can match.\nIn such fights, the lion usually bites the neck of a hyena and suffocates it to death.\nIs a Fight Between a Lion and a Hyena One-Sided?\nThe fight between a lion and a hyena is far from one-sided.\nThe jaws of hyenas are quite strong, and they are perfectly capable of killing a lion and breaking its bones.\nEven a victorious lion will have sustained acute injuries during any duel between these two rivals.\nA single mistake by the lion can spell the end of everything for him. And if a young, strong hyena faces an injured, old, or very young lion, it will probably win.\nThe hyenas increase their chances of success by attacking in groups.\nFor example, the hyenas swarm around the lion in a group and rip it apart by attacking from multiple directions.\nA Pack of Hyenas vs. a Pride of Lions: Who Would Win in a Fight?\nSince we have assessed reasonable outcomes of a one-on-one duel, one may find it interesting to assume that a battle between their respective groups has an even more uncertain outcome.\nWhat is for certain is such a battle can have dangerous outcomes for both groups.\nFor example, a savage battle that ensued between the two groups in Ethiopia reportedly resulted in the death of 35 hyenas and six lions.\nThe battle was savage and fought valiantly by both groups.\nThe dead ones were mostly those who were isolated from their companions.\nIt had the appearance of a real battle between two medieval armies, with both unwilling to give the ground.\nWhy Are Hyenas Not the \u201cKings of the Jungle?\u201d\nNow that we know how these two rivals stack up against one another, it begs the question about who is the rightful king of the jungle?\nThe answer is still the lion. Why?\nWhile a tiger or mountain lion may be compared to African lions for kingship in their respective habitats, no one will probably ever mention the hyenas.\nLet\u2019s have a look at the reasons why.\nHyenas Look\nIt is often said that the hyenas could have been considered for the title of the king if they were not so ugly and seemingly clumsy. Their walk is not as dominant as a lion\u2019s.\nThe grace, majesty, and exceptional beauty of the lions make them the ideal kings. Despite their hunting ability and strength, the hyenas are not as eye-catching as a lion.\nHyenas Hunting Habits\nTheir hunting habits hardly help them in their bid for the kingship.\nThey are scavengers and usually prefer not to hunt if some leftover from some other animal\u2019s kill is available.\nThis is in sharp contrast to the lions who prefer to kill and eat.\nA hyena\u2019s hunting behavior is more like hit and run, isolating the weakest ones and killing them in groups.\nAlthough the lions also do so when confronted with elephants and hippos, they still prefer to chase their prey and capture them.\nHyenas Lifestyle\nThe hyenas are social animals and prefer to live in groups called clans.\nAfter the death of a prominent female, her eldest daughter will inherit the position. Seems so ordinary? Yes.\nJust compare it to a lion\u2019s pride.\nA young male lion is forced to leave the pride of his birth, struggle for survival, and to fight his way into kingship.\nAll the weak and inappropriate candidates are killed off at the lower stages.\nAs a result, many young males never reach the position of being head of a pride of their own.\nDo Hyenas Roar?\nDespite their strength, the voice of a hyena is nothing more than the bark of a feeble jackal.\nIt barely compares to the mighty roar of a lion that can be heard almost 5 miles (8 km.) away.\nIn the end, we can conclude that, albeit being strong predators and group hunters, the hyenas are ranked below lions.\nA single hyena cannot kill a single lion, while a single lion can easily do so.\nAlthough a group of hyenas is a lethal killing machine, a pride of lions is equally up to the task, if not more so.\nThe position of a lion as \u201cKing of the Jungle\u201d remains unchallenged by hyenas."}

Tiger\nTigers can grow up to a length of 11 feet and weigh up to 300 kilograms when fully developed.\nTigers belong to the cat family and are the biggest of their species.\nTigers are excellent swimmers and capable of swimming up to six kilometres at a stretch.\nTigers are lone hunters and generally hunt at night, taking advantage of the dark and their strong night vision.\nTigers can reach a maximum speed of 65 km/ h while chasing a meal for the family.\nSimilarly, tigers can jump over 5 metres during hunts.\nThe Royal Bengal Tiger, Siberian Tiger, Sumatran Tiger and Indochinese Tiger are various sub-species found in India, China, Russia, and Indonesia.\nTiger cubs stay with their mothers only till they reach two years of age.\nMany subspecies of tigers have already become extinct or are endangered due to hunting and loss of forest cover due to civilisation.\nOnly 10% of tiger hunts turn out to be successful.\nA tiger\u2019s roar can be heard from more than two miles away. Tigers also hiss, growl, moan, and chuff.\n2. Dogs\nDogs have been loyal and useful companions to humans through the ages, providing physical and emotional security as loving pets.\nThere are about 400 million+ dogs in the entire world.\nDogs are quite useful as they carry out farm work, provide security, hunt, and even play guides to the visually-impaired. They are wonderful companions for children and the elderly, due to their ability to give care and unflinching love.\nThe most popular breeds of dogs include Labrador, Golden Retriever, Bulldog, German Shepherd, Greyhound, St. Bernard, Great Dane, Chihuahua, etc.\nDue to the strong emotional connect dogs form with humans as pets, they are known as \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d. They are extremely loyal and are known to spend their entire lifetime with their masters.\nDogs have a terrific sense of hearing as compared to humans and can hear sounds at four times the distance.\nThe average life of a dog depending on the breed can vary from 10 to 14 years.\nDue to their amazing sense of smell, dogs are capable of differentiating and recognising odours. For this reason, they are used to sniff out drugs and weapons by anti-terrorist squads and police departments all over the world.\nAs per the available scientific evidence, dogs are known to have been domesticated about 15000 years ago.\nDomesticated dogs are omnivores, as they can eat grains, vegetables, and meat as a part of their diet.\nDogs are incredibly emotional and actually get jealous when they see their master getting friendly with another human or animal.\n3. Dolphin\nDolphins are blessed with powerful eyesight and hearing, which they use along with echolocation to find the right location of objects.\nDolphins use whistling, clicking and other sounds to communicate with each other.\nThe Killer Whale or Orca is actually a type of a dolphin.\nMale dolphins are called bulls, females as cows and young dolphins are known as calves.\nThe most common type of dolphins found is Bottlenose dolphins.\nDolphins have a blowhole located at the top of their heads which they use to breathe.\nA group of dolphins is known as a pod or a school which consists of a dozen of these intelligent animals.\nDolphins are known to be extremely intelligent creatures and can interact with humans. They have a playful attitude which they display by riding waves and jumping in and out of the water, thus making them popular with kids and adults alike.\nDue to the use of nets, a large number of dolphins are killed every year and many species have become extinct.\nDolphins are meat-eating (carnivores) mammals.\nDolphins are incredibly social, and easily make friends with other dolphins,. In fact, they are said to create several \u2018social networks\u2019.\n4. Elephants\nElephants are the world\u2019s largest mammals living on land.\nThe African Elephant and the Asian Elephant are the two types of elephants, with Bush Elephant and Forest Elephant being sub-types of the African Elephant.\nThe elephant\u2019s trunk is entirely made up of about 100,000 muscles and no bones. A full-grown elephant\u2019s trunk can weigh about 140 kilograms and measure up to 2 metres.\nThe elephant uses its trunk to know the size, shape, and temperature of objects. It is used to suck in water or pick up food and put it into its mouth.\nAn adult elephant needs to drink more than 200 litres of water every day and it uses its tusks to dig the earth for this purpose.\nThe huge, thin ears of an elephant are made of blood vessels which help them to regulate their body temperature.\nElephants use their trunks to breathe when they swim in deep waters.\nElephants spend more than 16 hours every day uprooting twigs, leaves, and roots for their nourishment.\nMale elephants leave their herds when they reach 13 years of age, while females live in their herd for their entire lifetime.\nFemale elephants can get pregnant after 11 years of age and the pregnancy duration in elephants is 22 months.\nElephants are the most intelligent mammals, after the great apes (humans, gorillas, chimpanzees, etc.)\n5. Giraffe\nA full-grown male giraffe can weigh up to 1400 kilograms\nThe length of a giraffe\u2019s neck measures between 1.5 to 1.8 metres.\nA giraffe\u2019s tail is made up of hair that is about 10 times thicker than human hair.\nHorns are present on male and female giraffes, with males having up to three horns.\nThe female giraffe delivers her baby while standing up and the baby falls about six feet without injuring itself.\nA male giraffe fights using its neck, by swinging it from one side to the other.\nThe spots on a giraffe\u2019s body act as camouflage for protection against predators.\nA giraffe has four stomachs, which speeds up the digestion process.\nGiraffes are most vulnerable while bending down to drink water, as they cannot see an approaching predator.\nA giraffe\u2019s tongue is coated with bristly hair, which helps them to eat leaves from thorny trees like Acacia.\nJust like human fingerprints, no two giraffes have the same pattern on their body.\n6. Lion\nA male lion weighs around 180 kilograms, while an average female lion can weigh up to 130 kilograms.\nA lion\u2019s roar is so powerful, that it can be heard from eight kilometres away.\nThe heaviest lion ever weighed was at a mind-boggling 375 kilograms.\nThe responsibility of hunting mostly lies with female lions, as they are better hunters than males.\nLions are known to rest for around 20 hours a day.\nMales who possess darker manes are more likely to attract lionesses (female lions) for mating.\nLions do not possess a lot of stamina, due to which they can run only in short bursts.\nCountries like Singapore, Ethiopia, England, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, and Albania have named the lion as their national animal.\nLions have a lifespan of about 12 years.\nThe breeding of lion and tigers gives birth to off-spring known as ligers and tigons.\nLions are the most sociable animals in the cat family and live in prides of up to 25 individuals.\n7. Sharks\nA shark possesses an amazingly sharp sense of smell and can detect even a single drop of blood in the water.\nA shark\u2019s skeleton is made up of cartilage that is tough and has flexible tissues. There is not a single bone in their bodies.\nThey possess powerful hearing too, because of which they can hear a fish thrashing around even 500 metres away.\nSharks have a set of smaller teeth behind the front teeth. The smaller teeth move forward and the front teeth then fall off.\nSharks have to keep moving to get oxygen into their bloodstream, as the water passes over the gills.\nGreat whites can cut through the water at a speed of 30 km/ h and are the deadliest of all.\nThe whale shark can grow up to a massive length of 14 metres when fully developed.\nSome shark species lay eggs instead of living pups.\nA baby shark has to fend for itself right from birth, as its own mother could eat it up.\nThe great white has to eat large quantities of meat to keep its body temperature regulated.\nEach shark species has a different set of teeth\n8. Whales\nThere are about 80 different species of whales with different shapes and sizes.\nCreatures like sea lice and barnacles stick to the whale\u2019s skin and live there all their lives.\nWhales use a sing-song voice to call others and can sing a different tune, too.\nScientists use a wax plug in the whale\u2019s ear that has a pattern on it to determine its age.\nMost whales do not have teeth and use a comb-like fibre to filter tiny creatures from the water.\nWhale groups either consist of only male or only female whales and both almost never mix.\nThe migration of whales from the Northern and Southern hemisphere is timed such as to never meet each other in breeding areas.\nThough experienced, whales can lose their way during migration.\nA baby whale is known as a calf and is cared for by the entire group.\nThe \u201csmiling\u201d face of a whale is due to the lower arched lip it possesses.\nEven though the Blue Whale hunts in deep waters, it must come up to the surface of the water to breathe.\n9. Camel\nWhile providing desert animals information for kids, camels feature quite prominently in it.\nCamels have a life of 40 to 50 years.\nThere are two types of camels i.e. Dromedary (single-humped) and Bactrian (two-humped)\nCamels measure about seven feet up to their hump and six feet up to their shoulders.\nCamels are a good source of milk, wool, and meat and are used for transportation or carrying heavy loads, too.\nCamels have a thick coat on their body, provides protection from extreme heat and cold, making them suitable for deserts.\nCamels can survive up to six months without water or food due to the fatty tissues stored in their humps.\nThe fatty tissues in a camel\u2019s hump can be converted into energy or water, as and when required.\nCamels can drink 113 litres of water within 13 minutes and are the fastest mammals to re-hydrate.\nCamels have long legs, which help them stay above the hot desert surface.\nDromedary camels weigh between 300 to 600 kg, while Bactrian camels can weigh up to a maximum of 1000 kg.\nCamel milk has more Vitamin C and iron than cow\u2019s milk, and is widely available in Arab countries.\n10. Cheetah\nThe cheetah is the fastest animal to roam the earth, with top speeds of 113 km per hour.\nA cheetah can go up to speeds from 0 to 113 km /hour in a matter of seconds.\nThough fast, cheetahs tire very quickly and need to rest before they burst into top gear again.\nCheetahs weigh between 45-60 kilograms and are amongst the smallest members of the cat family.\nCheetahs have great eyesight and are able to sight their prey from five kilometres away during the daytime.\nCheetahs are the only members of the cat family unable to roar. However, they can purr quite loudly, especially when they are in a group or during one of their grooming sessions.\nAs opposed to other cat family members like lions and leopards who hunt at night, cheetahs are able to hunt only during the day.\nCheetahs have blunt claws and a light body weight, which makes them vulnerable to their enemies. They generally give up if larger animals confront them during a fight or a hunt, due to these physical restrictions.\nCheetahs have a poor night vision, which prevents hunting at night. They are also unable to climb trees due to their blunt claws, giving them a distinct disadvantage during hunting.\nA cheetah is recognisable by its dark lines, known as tear lines, that run from each eye towards the mouth. These tear lines protect the cheetah from the sun and give it long-distance vision that\u2019s necessary during hunting or protection from other predators.\nCheetahs don\u2019t stalk their prey. They simply creep up on them and chase them, which lasts for 20- 30 seconds.\nAs a parent, you may want to teach your child about the abundant flora and fauna on our planet. You may also want to help your child develop a keen interest in the world around \u2013 how things work, how people react, and so on. Stories are a wonderful way to do this.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Who Knew? 5 Amazing Zebra Facts - Lion World Travel", "url": "https://www.lionworldtravel.com/news/who-knew-5-amazing-zebra-facts", "text": "With so many majestic animals that call Africa home, it is little wonder that wildlife enthusiasts from around the world visit Africa to witness its abundance of beautiful creatures. One of the most iconic animals is, of course, the zebra. This wild, horse-like animal lives in harems and large herds across Southern and East Africa. But did you know that there are three species of zebra? Read on for more amazing facts about zebras, one of our favorite animals to see up close on safari.\nZebras at Sunset\n1) There Are Three Species of Zebra\nPlains, Mountain and Gr\u00e9vy's zebra comprise the three species of zebra. Plains zebra are the most common species of zebra, found throughout sub-saharan Africa from southern Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania all the way down to Botswana and South Africa. Though they are less common, Mountain zebra are found in large numbers in Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is the largest and most rare of the zebra species. Unfortunately, Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is also the most imperiled, with only an estimated 3,000 members left in the wild.\n2) Zebras Are Wild Animals That Cannot Be Domesticated\nEver wonder why zebras have never been used by humans in the way that horses and donkeys have? Well, it\u2019s not for lack of trying. According to writer Francis Galton, the Dutch Boers, among others, tried and failed to tame zebras to be used in transportation. The personality and character of the zebra is to blame: the animals frequently escaped their enclosures, and thwarted the training of their masters. This \u2018untrainable\u2019 behaviour may be the result of evolution: since zebras naturally live in large groups in an environment full of predators, their strong survival instinct makes them considerably less friendly to humans than their horse and donkey cousins.\n3) A Group of Zebras is Called a \u2018Dazzle\u2019\nOwing primarily to their distinctive striped coats, a group of zebra is called a \u2018dazzle\u2019. This name also refers to a unique phenomenon called \u201cmotion dazzle\u201d, an optical illusion that occurs when groups of zebra move quickly together. According to researchers, motion dazzle has a big benefits for zebras: the visual illusions caused by the stripes and moving zebras confuse the visual fields of other mammals, including predators, increasing the chances for zebras to escape. The black and white stripes can also ward off horse flies since the high contrast patterns make zebras a less attractive target to insects.\n4) Zebras Can Travel Long Distances\nZebra, like many other large African herbivores, are constantly on the move in search of water and food. In East Africa, zebras are part of the \u201cGreat Migration\u201d, an annual occurrence where millions of zebra, wildebeest and other antelope travel on a 500 mile circuit in Tanzania and Kenya, across the Serengeti, Maasai Mara and Ngorongoro Crater. In Southern Africa, researchers have tracked zebras traveling even further: 300 miles on a straight line across Namibia and Botswana. While this is shorter than the overall Great Migration circuit, it is longer in one single direction, making it the longest migration among all African mammals\u2014an impressive feat!\n5) Zebras are Black Animals with White Stripes\nIt's an age old question: are zebras white animals with black stripes? Or black animals with white stripes? For many years, scientists believed it to be the former (since many zebras have white underbellies), but cutting-edge genetic research has finally put the argument to rest: zebras are black animals with white stripes."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Fox Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Fox-facts.html", "text": "fox Facts\nPortrait of a red fox\nThe familiar fox that is most common in legend and lore is the red fox, but there are over 30 species of fox living in an amazing variety of environments all over the world. In general, foxes are small members of the dog family, the largest of which is the typical red fox.\nMost other species are considerably smaller.\nThe red fox is the most wide-spread carnivore in the world, living in every region of the Northern Hemisphere including Central America, and having been introduced by humans to Australia, where they are so successful they are considered a major pest.\nThe red fox in particular is extremely skilled at adapting to almost any environment. They have succeeded and thrived in close proximity to human beings and there are even some sub-species of red fox that live in heavy urban environments, taking advantage of their naturally nocturnal tendencies.\nMany other fox species are endangered or threatened, unable to adapt to human encroachment, while the red fox enjoys healthy populations all over the world.\nFoxes live in small groups, or alone. They don't have the kind of intense social structure we connect with other canines like the wolf and the dog.\nThey are solitary hunters even if living in a family group, and they are notorious for killing extra prey and burying it for later. This activity is probably how the \"sly\" signature got attached to the fox, although, foxes, in general, are very bright, inquisitive and intelligent animals.\nThere are unusual names applied to male and female foxes as well, the male being known as a \"reynard\" and the female, naturally, a \"vixen\"\nThere is no doubt of the beauty of these animals, (they've paid the price being regularly trapped for their fur). and there is no doubt why the term \"fox\" is often used to describe attractive people too! - Fox Facts\nwhat does the fox say?\nThe fox says allot, actually. Although they are members of the canine family, fox species don't bark like domestic dogs do.\nThey have a warning bark of their own that is very short, high-pitched, and usually singular, definitely not a \"bow-wow-wow\" type sound.\nThey do, however, make an amazing variety of noises- up to 20 different calls it is believed.\nFox vocalizations include chilling nighttime \"screams\", coyote-like howls, whimpers, \"snuffing\" noises, and a happy call that sounds like a human baby crying. But the most distinct sound most foxes make is a chuckling type noise called a \"gekker\".\nFoxes will gekker when they are fighting or playing. They will also gekker out of excitement and nervousness, and as most foxes are rather nervous creatures, the sound is emitted quite often.\nA litter of kits play-fighting will roll around gekkering for hours at a time. And a vixen defending her den will gekker an intruder right out of her territory. -Fox Facts\nfox reproduction\nfox vixen and kits\nThe fox family dynamic is very varied, with some animals forming fairly strong pair bonds, while others are more independent, and live in very loose family structures.\nThe red fox usually lives in a small family unit with a dominant pair, and two to five other individuals, usually maturing offspring. Similar to wolves, it is generally only the dominant female who will have kits, and the other family members will often assist in the raising of the kits.\nOccasionally, a father fox has been known to rear young on his own, after the demise of the mother. Red foxes and many other fox species dig simple, but roomy dens when the babies are about to be born, and the family will stay close by for up to three months while the young kits grow. The whole family takes care of the kits.\nThe rest of the year, foxes usually live basically out in the open, bedding down by turning in a tight circle to tamp down a little bed for themselves, just as we see domestic dogs do on the living room rug.\nAs the kits mature, they may leave to form their own family units, usually at about 10 to 18 months, or, sometimes will stay with their parents for life. When youngsters stay on, they often remain subordinate to the parents and help with the raising of the next generations of kits without producing offspring themselves.\nMother, father and siblings will regurgitate food for young kits and bring food back to the den. It has long been a belief that foxes live alone, and some do, but perhaps it is because they spread out and hunt alone, and if they are seen at all, it is when they are stalking prey or seeking their next meal. - Fox Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Within just a few generations the foxes not only became quite content with human contact, but sought it out and took comfort and even joy from being petted and played with.\nThe psychological changes were interesting for sure, but the physical changes were astounding.\nThe foxes changed color and began to develop patches in their coats, sometimes their tails turned curly and their ears flopped down. It seemed the traits that pushed towards a tamer animal perhaps had strong chemical influences as well.\nMost suggest the domesticated version has less adrenalin, and perhaps less testosterone. DNA research done on the foxes showed that major changes had taken place,and that this was basically a new animal, with strong hints of our domestic dog.\nToday, the study is no longer funded, and only continues with the sale of the foxes as pets. These domestic foxes, once a form of red fox but now known as \"silver foxes\" actually make sweet and lovely pets for many in Russia.\nmany beautiful little beasts\nfox species\nThere are twelve species of foxes in the genus \"vulpus\" which are known as the \"true foxes\". Among these, the red fox is the largest and most common, and is also the most wide spread carnivore in the world.\nThe grey fox, very similar to the red, is also quite large and fairly numerous.\nThe other species are smaller, ranging from the cat sized cape fox to the chihuahua sized fennec fox. There are also numerous species outside of the \"vulpus\" genus that are still referred to as foxes.\nMany of these are quite rare, and several are severely endangered.\nThe fox is somewhat fragile in the wild. Even the amazingly capable red fox which can live to 10 years old has a surprisingly short life expectancy of perhaps only 4 years in the wild.\nHunted, trapped, poisoned, hit by cars, pursued by larger predators, domestic dogs and the occasional birds of prey, too many of these little gems are struggling to hang on. - Fox Facts\nthe arctic fox\narctic fox pair\nThe stunning arctic fox may weigh only about seven pounds, and most of it is fur.\nLiving in some of the harshest conditions on earth, the little arctic fox blends in perfectly for 9 months of the year in glorious snowy white, and then quickly sheds and replaces its coat with brown fur for the few short spring and summer months .\nAmazingly suited to the snow and ice, it has snowshoe like fur on its paws to navigate wintry terrain, and uses its large tail as a muff while it sleeps.\nThe arctic fox can hear small rodents moving beneath the snow and pinpoint their location. With a few quick pounces the ice is broken and the prey is had.\na few more fox facts\ntwo red foxes, normal coloration and melanistic phase known as a \"silver fox\"\nThe red fox is not always red, but a variety of shades from cream to almost black.\nA foxes bones are about 30% lighter than the same size bone of a domestic dog.\nThe fox can hear rodents underground.\nThe grey fox has partially retractable claws - almost like a cat.\nThe fox is taxonomically a carnivore, but will eat almost anything, including fruit\nThe \"fox hunt\" is one of the most common themes in oil paintings, but rarely depicts the fox."}

Since they are carnivores, they generally eat other animals in the wild, including zebras, giraffes, and wild hogs. They have also been known to eat hippos and rhinos. When food is scarce, lions will even prey on elephants.\n2. Since the 1950s, the lion population in Africa has been cut down by half. There are fewer than 21,000 lions currently living in the wild in Africa today.\n3. Lions were once found in different parts of the world, including northern India, the Middle East, and Greece. Today, however, they are only found in parts of eastern and southern Africa as well as the southern region of the Saharan desert.\n4. A pride is the term for a group of lions. It typically consists of about 15 lions, mostly female lions and their young.\n5. Female lions do most of the hunting. They are nocturnal animals and they generally work in teams when stalking prey.\n6. There is no specific mating season for lions. They can mate throughout the year.\n7. The gestation period for lions is between 100 and 119 days. Mothers give birth to a litter of three or four lion cubs each time. Cubs only weigh about three pounds when they are born, which is typically less than one percent of their body weight when they are full grown adults.\n8. There are two surviving species of lion \u2013 the Asian and the African. The Asian species of lion is endangered with only about 300 of them living in India right now.\n9. A lion cub weighs about three pounds when it is born. By the age of two, it has already become a good hunter.\n10. Fully grown adult male lions weigh between 330 and 500 pounds. They average about four feet in height and up to 8 feet long. Female adult lions weigh between 265 and 400 pounds and they get as tall as 3.5 feet.\n11. Lions can go up to six days without drinking any water.\n12. Lions are only second to the tiger when it comes to being the largest cat species in the world.\n13. A lion\u2019s roar can be heard as far as five miles away.\n14. Lions can run as fast as 50 miles per hour. However, due to their lack of stamina, they can only keep up this speed for a short time.\n15. The heaviest lion ever recorded weighted 826 pounds.\n16. Several countries have the lion listed as their national animal, including England, Ethiopia, Bulgaria, Singapore and others.\n17. Lions rest for about 16 to 20 hours each day.\n18. Lions have been known to be able to leap distances of 36 feet.\n19. Catnip can affect lions in much the same way that it affects the traditional house cat.\n20. Another name for a male lion is \u201ctom.\u201d Female lions are often referred to as a lioness or a she-lion. Cubs, lionets, and whelps are also used to refer to baby lions.\n21. A lion\u2019s eyesight is about 5 times better than the eyesight of a human.\n22. Even though the female lions typically catch and kill the prey, the male lion east first.\n23. Lions almost never eat their entire prey. In most cases, they will leave a large portion of it for the vultures and other animals to feed off of.\n24. Deforestation and habitat destruction are the two major reasons why the lion has dropped in population so drastically and been placed on the list of endangered species.\n25. Lions, especially lion cubs, have several animals that prey on them. Some of these animals include hyenas, leopards, wild buffaloes, snakes and even eagles."}

(Surprising Facts) - The Big Zoo", "url": "https://thebigzoo.com/animals/do-lions-eat-lions/", "text": "Lions are the only big cat that hunts in groups, and they\u2019re intensely social animals. The adults spend almost all their time together, and when they aren\u2019t hunting or sleeping, they\u2019re grooming one another. So it might be a little surprising to hear that lions do, on occasion, kill members of their own pride.\nDo Lions eat Lions?\nNo, Lions do not cannibalize and usually don\u2019t prefer to eat their own kind. Lions are highly social animals, forming large pride that can contain dozens to hundreds of individuals. When lions are fighting over territorial rights or a new piece of food, they will often fight to the death.\nA lion will rarely eat its own partner, as they usually prefer to hunt for themselves and for their cubs. In most cases lions are much more prone to attack and kill prey more than predators.\nOne possible exception to this rule is when all the lions in a pride are involved in killing another group of lions. In this case, other lions in the same pride may take a step back and allow the original lion\u2019s pride to hunt them down. Lions have also been observed feeding on the remains of dead members of their own pride during times of famine.\nDo lions cannibalize?\nOn occasion, lions may eat their own dead. And it\u2019s usually not because they\u2019re starving; lions tend to eat their own dead when they\u2019re around, so that the body doesn\u2019t get contaminated. Lions don\u2019t usually prefer to eat their own kind, however, so this is usually a last resort for them.\nDo lions eat baby lions?\nThis does occur from time to time when male lions join a new pride and trying to claim the territory, a Lion can eat other curbs to show dominance to other males and females.\nThey may also eat a small lion cub that has lost its mother. Lions tend to kill and eat members of their own kind when they\u2019re in times of starvation, which makes sense since they are highly carnivorous animals, but it is in their nature to hunt and make sure they are okay.\nOther than this, lions absolutely never eat baby lions.\nDo female lions eat male lions?\nAlthough Lioness does most of the hunting they rarely kill Male Lions since they are bigger and stronger in nature, this makes it tough for a female lion to try attempt to kill and eat a male lion.\nDo male lions eat the females?\nIn most cases, the female lion will be accepted and welcomed by a male lion who ruling their pride. If a male lion does kill another male lion, this usually only happens during a fight.\nOn rare occasions, they have been known to throw the mangled remains of their challengers at each other. Lions like to eat their leaders, but they have never killed each other to do so. Many theories exist as to why this could instill such aggression in a pride of lions.\nWhat do Lions Eat?\nThe main prey that lions eat is large game, including antelopes and zebras. Because of the size of the prey that lions hunt, especially larger antelopes and zebras, a single hunt can feed an entire pride for several days to a few weeks.\nSmaller animals like birds or hares are also hunted by lions, although they aren\u2019t as important in terms of nutrition. Lions usually target the weaker members of herds, though this isn\u2019t always the case. As lions have a very impressive hunting ability, they are able to successfully prey on even the strongest members of a herd.\nHow do Lions hunt?\nLions have been observed targeting large games more often than smaller animals. When hunting their prey, a group of four or five lions will work together to bring down one animal.\nThe pride will begin to stalk their prey from as far away as half a mile away. Once the lioness has signaled that she is ready to attack, the pride will rush in and surround the animal within seconds.\nAfter a lioness knocks the animal down, she will jump back so that another member of the pride can attack. The pride members will continue to bite and claw at their prey until it is dead.\nLions have also been known to hunt in pairs, with one lion stalking the prey while another lies in ambush. They have even been known to use teamwork in order to catch birds\nFinal Thoughts\nTo many people, the question of whether lions eat other lions is unintelligible. But that\u2019s because they\u2019re not familiar with the natural order of things. Every day, every living creature eats other living creatures, and this is perfectly normal. Since all animals are equal in their rights to life and death, it doesn\u2019t matter to a lion what type of prey it takes."}

Like most animals, lions use their vocal chords to communicate with each other and to prevent intrusion of their territory boundaries. They rely on lengthy claws, strong teeth and sandpaper-like tongues to catch, kill and consume prey.\nLions also have large and pronounced paws, which are large in comparison to their body size, and they facilitate long journeys through the desert. These paws have hard layers of padding on the sole to keep lions\u2019 feet safe from debris and hot sands, and they have long claws to help grip surfaces and tear through the tough skins and hides of prey. Lastly, loose belly skin protects inner organs from damage when kicked by hoofed prey such as gazelles and impalas.\nADVERTISEMENT"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Golden Lion Tamarin images!\nThe golden lion tamarin is a small monkey native to the coastal Brazil.\nSometimes called a golden marmoset, it has a long tail, reddish-gold fur, and a dramatic mane that frames its face. Due in part to a shrinking habitat, the golden lion tamarin population has dwindled dangerously near extinction, but intensive conservation efforts over the past few years have pulled it back to endangered status. Currently, less than 3,000 individuals occupy the rainforests of Brazil\u2019s southern Atlantic coast.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Facts\nFemales typically give birth to twins.\nThe golden lion tamarin has a high risk of mortality \u2013 close to 50 percent \u2013 in its first year of life.\nThis type of monkey has an average lifespan of 10 years in the wild.\nIt mainly eats fruit, nuts, and small animals.\nIt has claw-like nails rather than flat nails like other primates.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Scientific Name\nThe golden lion tamarin is a small, New World monkey that belongs to the Callitrichidae family of arboreal mammals. It shares the Leontopithecus genus with three other species:\nThe golden-headed lion tamarin or L. chrysamelus\nThe black lion tamarin or L. chrysopygus\nThe Superagui lion tamarin or L. caissara\nThe golden lion tamarin\u2019s scientific name is Leontopithecus rosalia, which refers both to its lion-like mane and its red coloring. All four tamarin species live in Brazilian rainforests.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Appearance\nA pint-sized monkey that lives in the trees, the golden marmoset has a luxurious, long reddish-gold coat that covers its entire body except for its face and paws. A ruff of fur frames its furless face and sweeps back over the ears like the mane of a lion, lending this New World monkey an exotic appearance. It also has a hank of red-gold whiskers on each cheek.\nThe tamarin\u2019s paws resemble hands, but rather than flat fingernails, or ungulae, like those of humans and other primates, the tamarin has claws, which are also called tegulae. These help it dig into tree bark to get the insects it eats and to cling to branches as it travels through the treetops.\nThe weight range for golden lion tamarins, the largest Leontopithecus species, is between 482 and 680 grams (17 and 24 ounces), so they are about the size of a gray squirrel. Tamarins measure 15 to 25 centimeters in length (6 to 10 inches). Their tails add about 32-40 centimeters (12 to 15 inches) to their length. Males and females are usually similar in size and weight.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Behavior\nLike squirrels, the tamarin travels on all fours, scurrying between tree branches 10 to 30 meters (29 to 100 feet) above the forest floor. It digs into cracks in the tree bark for insects. It pries into small holes with its deft, hairless fingers. It then shares whatever food is available with its family group.\nThese arboreal creatures are social within a core group of up to eight relatives. Like other monkeys, they groom each other, and the young ones play together. The mating pair in each family group is typically monogamous for life.\nGolden lion tamarin families are part of larger troops that mark their territory with scent to ward off outsiders. They also vocalize whining calls to warn of danger. When they are in an aggressive mode, they arch their backs, open their mouths and stare. They make peeping calls when feeling friendly.\nThese golden marmosets also have a trilling call in their vocabulary, which they use to let others in their troop know their location. They may cluck when searching for food, and screech in delight when playing.\nGroups of tamarins re-nest often as another measure to evade predators. They will nestle in the hollows of trees, bed down on a nest of vines or another sheltered spot high in the treetops. Their typical daytime routine consists of foraging for fruit and nectar in the morning and then catching insects in the afternoon. In the late afternoon to evening, they choose a new sleeping spot.\nLucas.Barros/Shutterstock.com\nGolden Lion Tamarin Habitat\nGolden lion tamarins live in three small regions of southeastern Brazil. Their rainforest habitat has shrunk to less than three percent of its former size due to human activities and encroachment. All three locations are wildlife preserves: Poco das Antas Biological Reserve, Unaio Biological Reserve, and a privately owned reserve that works with the Reintroduction Program, all in the state of Rio de Janeiro.\nDifferent troops have made adaptations to survive in various types of terrain. Due to a fractured habitat, some live in lowland coastal rainforests while others prefer forested hilltops or wetlands along Brazil\u2019s southeastern coast.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Diet\nThese tree-dwelling primates eat a diet of foods available in their rainforest canopy habitat. Because they are omnivores, they eat both animal and vegetable matter. For example, everything from spiders to small lizards finds its way into their diet, depending on local availability and season.\nThey also feast on flower nectar, tree fruits and flower petals. Their main criterion in choosing their food is whether it is small enough for them to handle. As they eat and digest fruits and flowers, they naturally disperse the seeds throughout their habitat in their feces, helping to maintain the abundance of the environment.\nThey enjoy unique adaptations that help them dig into tree bark for the insects they eat. Their slender fingers have claw-like nails rather than the flattened ones specific to other types of monkeys and to humans. These adaptations have another purpose as well. They make it safer for golden lion tamarins to travel through the treetops because their claws help them get a safer grip on the branches, reducing the risk of dangerous falls.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Predators and Threats\nA few of the animals that share the rainforest with the tamarin, or golden marmoset, prey on it too. Large birds of prey, raccoon-like coatis, snakes and margays, small Brazilian wildcats, all pose a threat of predation to the golden lion tamarin.\nHuman activities nearly drove tamarins to extinction in the 1960s, and they remain a significant, ongoing threat to the population. Clearcutting tamarin habitat for valuable wood products and charcoal-making has diminished tamarin habitat by 98 percent.\nAdditional destruction of habitat due to urban sprawl further decimates the tamarins\u2019 homes. Ranchers who cut down forestland to create grazing fields for cattle are another threat to a number of native species, as are big agricultural conglomerates expanding their farming operations.\nIn the past, the illegal trade in golden lion tamarins further challenged conservation efforts for this small, attractive species. Poachers captured them to sell as pets and zoo exhibits. The strength of the current conservation movement has minimized this once-pervasive threat, however.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nGolden marmosets are typically monogamous, with a single mating pair within a family group reproducing. Mating season begins as the rainy season draws to a close between April and June. The gestation time for a golden lion tamarin baby is four months, so the baby will be born sometime between September and February.\nTamarins usually give birth to twins, although occasionally, triplets or quadruplets make an appearance. During the first month after birth, a set of baby tamarin twins depends completely on its mother. She nurses them and carries them on her back.\nAfter those initial weeks, the entire family group helps with childcare and feeding, including the father. A baby typically begins socializing at about 17 weeks.\nThe dominant female and male of the group can begin reproducing when each is approximately two-and-a-half years old. Other mature males and females do not reproduce until they have formed their own family groups.\nTheir first year is the riskiest for these infants. The mortality rate for babies under a year of age is nearly 50 percent. After they have survived the critical first year of life, they are young adults.\nOn average, a golden lion tamarin lives about 10 to 15 years in the wild. The longest-lived are those in captivity. One captive male lived nearly 25 years.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Population\nAlthough population estimates vary, there are likely about 3,000 golden lion tamarins left in the wilds of Brazil, and nearly 500 living in zoos throughout the world. At its lowest point, the population totaled a scant 200 in the mid-20th century, but since then, numbers have gradually multiplied, thanks to the efforts of conservation groups.\nGolden Lion Tamarin in the Zoo\nThese small, active primates live in zoos throughout the world. Approximately 38 states in the U.S. host golden lion tamarins too. These include Zoo Atlanta in Georgia, Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington D.C., and Audubon Zoo in New Orleans.\nView all 111 animals that start with G"}

Pinnipedia is made up of three main groups: The walrus, which is the only living member of the family Odobenidae; the eared seals of Otariidae, including numerous kinds of fur seal and sea lion; and the earless seals, known as true seals or Phocidae. Despite the name, earless seals have ears\u2014they\u2019re just hidden beneath the surface of their skin.\nPinnipeds can be found on every continent on Earth, though most species occur in cold-water environments. Thick layers of fat, also known as blubber, keep the animals warm, in addition to dense fur. Walruses are the exception to the rule, as these large, tusked pinnipeds have nearly hairless bodies.\nSeals range greatly in size, from the gargantuan southern elephant seal, which can weigh more than a pickup truck, to the relatively slender, 100-pound Baikal seal.\nWhile there are many differences among the species, all seals have feet shaped like fins. In fact, the word pinniped means \"fin-footed\" in Latin. Those fin-shaped feet make them supreme swimmers, and all pinnipeds are considered semi-aquatic marine mammals. This means they must spend some part of their lives on land or sea ice, usually during the mating and birthing seasons.\nWith so much time spent in water, some species like the elephant seals have evolved the ability to hold their breath for up to two hours and dive to depths of more than 6,500 feet looking for food. (Read more about how diving animals can stay underwater for so long.)\nNearly all seal species are reliant on marine habitats, though some will enter estuaries and rivers in search of food. An outlier is the Baikal seal, which spends its whole life in Lake Baikal, a freshwater lake in Siberia.\nEvolutionarily speaking, seals are thought to be most closely related to bears and the group of animals that includes weasels and otters, as well as skunks, raccoons, and red pandas.\nVaried diets\nAll seals eat other animals, and most rely on fish caught out at sea. But a few species break the mold.\nFor instance, leopard seals make a living hunting down penguins and even other seals. And walruses survive on a diet of clams and other shellfish, which they detect with their highly sensitive whiskers and then suction up from the seafloor with their powerful mouths.\nThere is also a species of pinniped known as the crabeater seal, which lives in Antarctica. However, these animals don\u2019t eat crabs at all\u2014at least not the kind you would think. Instead, these seals use highly specialized teeth to filter water for tiny, abundant crustaceans known as Antarctic krill.\nPinnipeds in peril\nHistorically, hunters have heavily targeted pinniped species for their fur, a practice that drove some species to extinction: The Caribbean monk seal, for instance, disappeared from the planet in the 1970s. Though hunting is more regulated today, the animals still face many threats, including lack of food, entanglement in fishing gear, and conflict with fishermen. Some species, like the Hawaiian monk seal and Mediterranean monk seal, remain very close to extinction.\nHowever, climate change represents the single largest threat to many species of pinnipeds, especially those that rely on sea ice. Various species of Arctic seals rely on ice for breeding, for instance, while walruses use seasonal ice formations to forage for food farther from shore. (Read how climate change is changing what leopard seals eat.)\nRinged seals build caves in the snow and create holes in the ice that give them access to the ocean. If that snow melts earlier than usual, it will put the animals at greater risk of predation from polar bears."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Cougar | National Geographic", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/cougar", "text": "Common Name : Cougar (Mountain Lion) Scientific Name : Puma concolor Type : Mammals Diet : Carnivore Size : Head and body: 3.25 to 5.25 feet; tail: 23.5 to 33.5 inches Weight : 136 pounds Size relative to a 6-ft man : IUCN Red List Status : ? Least concern LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Decreasing\nThis powerful predator roams the Americas, where it is also known as a panther, puma, mountain lion, and catamount. This big cat of many names is also found in many habitats, from Florida swamps to Canadian forests.\nHunting\nCougars like to prey on deer, though they also eat smaller animals such as coyotes, porcupines, and raccoons. They usually hunt at night or during the gloaming hours of dawn and dusk. These cats employ a blend of stealth and power, stalking their prey until an opportunity arrives to pounce, then going for the back of the neck with a fatal bite. They will hide large carcasses and feed on them for several days.\nPopulation Decline and Rebound\nCougars once roamed nearly all of the United States. They were prized by hunters and despised by farmers and ranchers who suffered livestock losses at their hands. Subsequently, by the dawn of the 20th century, cougars were eliminated from nearly all of their range in the Midwest and Eastern U.S.\u2014though the endangered Florida panther survives.\nToday, whitetail deer populations have rebounded over much of the cougar's former range and a few animals have appeared in more eastern states such as Missouri and Arkansas. Some biologists believe that these big cats could eventually recolonize much of their Midwest and Eastern range\u2014if humans allow them to do so. In most western U.S. states and Canadian provinces, populations are considered sustainable enough to allow managed sport hunting.\nBehavior\nCougars require a lot of room\u2014only a few cats can survive in a 30-square-mile range. They are solitary and shy animals, seldom seen by humans. While they do occasionally attack people\u2014usually children or solitary adults\u2014statistics show that, on average, there are only four attacks and one human fatality each year in all of the U.S. and Canada.\n1:33"}

The Arctic North Pole, situated in the Northern hemisphere, is known for its extreme weather, climate and incredibly diverse fauna and flora. But which animals make up this full list of arctic animals living in the North Pole? For more about North Polar animals, their adaption and additional characteristics, keep reading here at AnimalWised. Here, we\u2019ll be discovering everything you need to know about this rich fauna, with the inclusion of a full list of arctic animals and some fun facts associated with them.\nArctic Animals list\nThe North Pole, located in the middle of Arctic Ocean, is made up of a huge floating ice cap. Unlike the South Pole, the North Pole lacks both mass and solid ground. Geographically placed between parallels 66\u00ba - 99\u00ba of northern latitude, it is the northernmost point on the planet. Given our biology as humans and the extreme conditions of the Arctic, living in the North Pole is practically impossible. In addition, due to its constantly moving ice caps, it\u2019s practically impossible to establish a permanent community in the North Pole. Given its location, the North Pole enjoys months of continuous sunlight, followed by another 6 months of complete nighttime. During winter and autumn, North Pole temperature oscillates between -43\u00baC and -26\u00baC, highlighting its harshest time of the year. Although hard to believe, this is considered \"warm\" compared to South Pole winters, where temperatures dip to -65\u00baC. During both spring and summer, temperatures level at around 0\u00baC. It is precisely during this time when large numbers of living beings struggle to survive. This also occurs because this is a period in which there is a greater decrease in ice. Thawing in the North Pole is one of the most prominent global issues today. Although Arctic sea ice ranges between 2-3 meters in thickness, this has decreased considerably over recent years. The fact of the matter is, Global warming is accelerating at a rapid and worrying speed. This increase in warmth threatens both the North and South Poles, as well as the animals that live there. This loss will eventually result in incredibly severe complications, negatively affecting the planet\u2019s health, its general climate and subsistence of all ecosystems.\nArctic animals: facts\nCompared to the South Pole, where climatic conditions are harsher, the North Pole holds greater biodiversity. However, in comparison to other fauna located in warmer climates, there are very few animals that live in the North Pole. Endemic Arctic animals stand out, in general, for the following: A thick layer of fat under the skin : to isolate themselves from the cold and keep their bodies warm.\n: to isolate themselves from the cold and keep their bodies warm. Dense fur : in order to protect and adapt to the intense cold.\n: in order to protect and adapt to the intense cold. White hair : used by Arctic mammals for camouflage to defend themselves or attack prey.\n: used by Arctic mammals for camouflage to defend themselves or attack prey. Few bird species: there are hardly any bird species endemic to the Arctic. And those that are, tend to migrate south during the winter in search of warmth.\n1. Polar bear\nFirst on our list of Arctic animals is the famous polar bear (Ursus maritimus). These cute-looking marine mammals are actually considered one of the strongest of the arctic animals. This particular species is only visible in these Arctic regions. Polar bears are solitary, intelligent and very protective when it comes to their offspring, which are born during hibernation periods. Polar bears are carnivorous animals that feed on a wide variety of mammals, such as seal pups or reindeer. Unfortunately, this emblematic arctic animal is also at higher risk of extinction. In fact, polar bears were listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (2018) and are at risk of disappearing completely. But, why are polar bears endangered? Polar bears are in danger of extinction due to climate change and the subsequent destruction of their habitat. In addition, approximately 500 to 600 polar bears are killed yearly as a result of illegal hinting.\n2. Harp Seal\nSecond on our Arctic animals list is the incredibly cute harp seal, also known as the saddleback seal. Seals are gregarious animals that live in groups and feed on fish and molluscs. These mammals, categorized within the group of pinnipeds, can dive up to 60 meters deep and remain under water for a whopping 15 minutes. Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) are noticeable for their beautiful white and yellowish coat at birth which turns silver-gray as they get older. Once considered adults, arctic seals can weigh between 400 to 800 kg and reach, despite their heavy weight, speeds of more than 50 km/h. Despite being a prominent source of prey for many other arctic animals, harp seals are long-living and can live for up to 50 years. For more, we recommend reading our article where we list all types of seals around the world.\n3. Humpback whale\nAmong the Arctic ocean animals we have the humpback whale and/or rorquals. The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is one of the largest aquatic mammals in the world, measuring a length of 14 meters with a weight of around 36 tons. This particular species can be recognized by its characteristic \"hump\" located in the dorsal fin. In addition, humpback whales are very sociable animals. Humpback whales tend to feed in polar waters and migrate to warmer waters to breed and give birth. Unfortunately, these animals have been targeted by the whale hunting industry and are fortunately protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. If you love aquatic animals as much as we do, you\u2019ll love our aquatic mammals list.\n4. Walrus\nNext on our list of Arctic animals facts we have the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus). This carnivorous semi-aquatic mammal belongs to the pinniped family and carries huge tusks which can can reach up to 1 meter in length. Like other Arctic animals of the North Pole, they have an incredibly thick skin and can weight up to 1,700 kg in males and 1,250 in females. Did you know that Walruses actually dive to the bottom of the ocean to search for food and can hold their breath for up to 30 minutes? Amazing right!?\n5. Arctic fox\nThis canidae stands out for its unique beauty, its white mantle and its sociable character. In addition to its coat, the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) sports a pointed nose and long ears. Since the arctic fox is nocturnal, its smell and hearing senses are very developed. These incredibly strong senses allow the arctic fox to locate and catch their prey under ice. The arctic fox diet is made up of lemmings, sea bird eggs, \u2018leftover\u2019 seals and fish. Despite being a small animal of between 3 and 9.5 kg, the arctic fox is clearly a natural predator. Did you know that arctic foxes are monogamous animals? For more about animals that keep one partner for life, keep reading our list of the 10 animals most faithful to their mates.\nArctic animal list\nWithin the wild nature of this region we can find, in addition to the previous emblematic species, the following Arctic animals: Narval (Monodon monoceros) Sea lion (Otariinae) Elephant seal (Mirounga) Beluga whale(Delphinapterus leucas) Caribou or reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) Arctic Wolf (Canis lupus arctos) Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus) Lion\u2019s mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) Snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) Muskox (Ovibos moschatus) Norway lemming (Lemmus lemmus) At last we need to clear up one of the most common misconceptions about arctic animals: there are no penguins in the North Pole. Although there are other types of birds of the North Pole, such as the Arctic Tern, penguins are endemic to Antarctica. For more about these wonderful arctic animals, with emphasis on the polar bear, we recommend watching our video below where we answer one of the most commonly asked questions, \u2018\u2018Is the polar bear in danger of extinction?\u2019\u2019"}

These amazing creatures that live on our land, beneath the oceans, and beyond will surely make you smile when you discover interesting fun facts about them.\nHere are some of the fun facts about animals from around the world that will remind you that the world is an awesome place.\n1.Koala fingerprints are so close to humans' that they could taint crime scenes.\nIf you take a closer look at Koalas hands, you'd see that they have fingerprints that are almost identical just like humans.\nIn fact, they're so similar that not even careful analysis under a microscope can easily distinguish when it involves loopy, whirling ridges on koalas' fingers from our own.\n2.Parrots will selflessly help each other out.\nResearchers have discovered that parrots will voluntarily help each other obtain food rewards and perform selfless acts.\nAccording to a 2020 study published in Current Biology co-author Auguste von Bayern noted, \"African grey parrots were intrinsically motivated to assist others, albeit the opposite individual wasn't their friend, in order that they behaved very pro-socially.\n3.Prairie dogs kiss.\nPrairie dogs are quirky creatures as they're giant rodents, they dig massive underground homes, and that they kiss. When they seem to be sweetly sharing a smooch they are actually touching their front teeth to identify each other.\nThe BBC explains that scientists believe prairie dogs kiss and cuddle more when they are being watched by zoo visitors because they enjoy the attention.\n4.The mantis shrimp has the world's fastest punch.\nIt's the mantis shrimp that has the world's fastest punch than a boxer, traveling at about 50 mph.\nAccording to Science its little fists are \"accelerating faster than a .22-caliber bullet\". National Geographic also shared the tale of Tyson a mantis in April 1998, an aggressive creature who smashed through the quarter-inch-thick glass wall of his cell.\n5.The world's oldest known breed of domesticated dog dates back to 329 BC.\nDogs are well known for being man's best friend and this relationship goes back longer than you might expect. Consistent with Guinness World Records, the oldest known breed of domesticated dog goes all the way back to 329 BC.\"There are carvings found in Sumer which represent a dog, which resembles a Saluki, which dates back to 7000 BC.\"\n6.And the oldest evidence of domesticated cats dates back 9,500 years.\nAccording to Guinness World Records reports humans have been domesticating cats for over 9,500 years.\nIn 2004 it was proved \"bones of a cat were discovered within the Neolithic village of Shillourokambos in Cyprus. The position of the cat within the ground was next to the bones of a person's, whose similar state of preservation strongly suggests they were buried together.\"\n7.Bottlenose dolphins are even more right-handed than humans.\nAccording to Scientific American \"Around 70-80% humans are right-handed and the remaining are left-handed\". And the same goes for bottlenose dolphins.\nA team of Florida's Dolphin Communication Project noticed the feeding behavior of bottlenose dolphins and found that the animals were turning to their left side 99.44 percent of the time, which \"actually suggests a right-side bias\".\n8.Cows painted with zebra-like stripes can avoid being bitten by flies.\nCows have to deal with the annoying pesky flies. Farmers can now protect their animals by painting them with zebra-like stripes.\nA study of PLOS One published in 2019 states that \"the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly less than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes.\" This worked because the stripes cause a sort of motion that confused them much within the way that optical illusions.\n9.Capuchin monkeys wash their hands and feet in urine.\nCapuchin monkeys wash their feet and hands in urine to urge comfort or sex. Many species of monkeys rinse their feet and hands in their own waste by urinating on their hands and rubbing their feet.\nPrimatologist Miller told NBC News. \"Capuchin monkeys could be doing it because they're excited.\" Either way, ew!\n10.Sperm whales in the Caribbean have an accent.\nPeople from different areas around the world tend to speak with inflections, fluctuations, and patterns that are specific to their home regions. Strangely, the same can be said for whales.\nResearchers of Dalhousie University in Canada and the University of St. Andrews in the UK have found evidence that whales found in the Caribbean have a different accent than whales in other oceans.\n11.Cowbirds use secret passwords to teach their young.\nAccording to Science Daily \"Juvenile cowbirds readily recognize and affiliate with other cowbirds. That's because they need a secret handshake or password.\"\nCowbirds lay their eggs in other bird's nests, which suggests that their little ones eventually got to reconnect with their own kind when the time is true. And when that point comes, the young birds have a trick for deciding whom to succeed in bent, simply they use \"a specific chatter call\" to interact with one another.\n12.Pigeons can do the math.\nOne of the studies of 2011 published in the journal Science found that birds are capable of doing math. During the study, the pigeons were asked to compare nine images, each containing a different number of objects.\nThe researchers found that the birds were able to rank the images in order of how many objects they contained. You might think of pigeons as not that smart but they're actually quite intelligent!\n13.Frogs can freeze without dying.\nAccording to Kenneth Storey, a professor at Carleton University \"We have false springs here all the time where it gets really warm and all the snow melts and then suddenly bam the wind comes from the north and it's back down to -10 to -15 Celsius and they're fine\". Frogs undergo repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n14.Reindeer eyes turn blue in the winter.\nAccording to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, \"the eyes of Arctic reindeer change color through the seasons from gold to blue, adapting to extreme changes of sunshine levels in their environment.\"\nThe change in color impacts how light is reflected through the animals' retina, and improves their vision. Reindeers have beautiful baby blues eyes but only in the winter!\n15.Sloths can take up to a month to completely digest a single leaf.\nEverything about life is slow for these sleepy mammals. With its slow metabolism, it's going to take the sloth a month to digest one leaf.\nFor comparison, it takes the typical human 12 to 48 hours to ingest, digest, and eliminate waste from food.\n16.Adult cats only meow at humans.\nAccording to the ASPCA, while \u201cKittens meow to let their mother know they\u2019re cold or hungry, but once they get a bit older, cats no longer meow to other cats.\nBut they continue to meow at people throughout their lives.\u201d Cats mostly do this to get human\u2019s attention. Next time the cat wants your attention, it will make \u2018miaow\u2019 again!\n17.Painted turtles survive winter by breathing through their butts.\nPainted turtles need to adapt to frozen ponds, which restrict their access to the air above the water. In the winter, Painted Turtles do something called brumation, which may be a period of dormancy, almost like hibernation. During brumation, these turtles use their butts for breathing. This process is called cloacal respiration.\n18.Snow leopards don't roar.\nAccording to a study of 2010 published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, scientists researched why some cats have a higher-pitched meow than others. Through this study, they found that it's not the size that determines a kitty's call, but its habitat.\nSnow leopards have less-developed vocal cords than their fellow large cats, this means that they can't roar, but make a purr-like sound called a chuff.\n19.Squirrels will adopt orphans.\nAn evolutionary biologist Andrew McAdam said, \u201cSocial animals, including lions and chimpanzees, are often surrounded by relatives, so it isn't surprising that a female would adopt an orphaned loved one because they need already spent tons of your time together.\u201d\nAccording to the study of the University of Guelph, animals will take in the orphaned pups of their late family members. Turns out, squirrels have an intense motherly instinct.\n20.Moths experience love at first scent.\nWell, love, at first sight, is not only meant for humans but the same goes for a moth.\nWhen a male moth catches a whiff of a female moth, he'll travel miles to find her\u2060 based on her scent alone.\nAccording to the experts at Audobon, \"they don't know what the female sounds like, or even what she looks like. But when they smell her, boy, do they know it, and they use her seductive musk to track her down.\"\n21.Ravens are masters of deception.\nA 2002 study published in Animal Behaviour found that these birds have the ability to deceive each other. The entire corvid family which includes crows, ravens, and jays is exceptionally intelligent. Ravens have also been known to play pranks on one another and to tease other animals.\n22.Cats recognize their own name but choose not to respond.\nIn a 2019 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers discovered that cats can recognize their own name but they don't necessarily feel obligated to respond.\nSorry, cat owners, your pet does know when you're calling their name, yet they're ignoring you.\n23.Cows produce more milk when listening to slow music.\nResearchers at the University of Leicester School of Psychology found that slow music can reduce stress in cows and increase the amount of milk they produce by 3% as opposed to more upbeat tunes.\n24.Catfish have taught themselves how to kill pigeons.\nIn southwestern France, a group of European catfish has learned to kill pigeons, launching themselves out of the water to grab the sunbathing birds.\nResearchers have no idea why they hunt the birds but guess it could be because of declining prey.\n25.Dragonflies create a heart with their tails while mating\nDragonflies even create a combined heart-shaped with their tails when mating. Dragonflies symbolize change, transformation, adaptability, mark a sign of spiritual growth, and emotional maturity seeing one of these flutterings around has a special meaning. Not only this, but they also embody love in many ways.\n26.Penguins propose to each other with pebbles\nJust like humans propose to each other by exchanging a ring, penguins also use the same method but with a pebble. When penguins choose a mate, they give a small stone over to them, which represents their lifelong commitment to each other. This one really pulls on your heartstrings!\n27.Ghost crabs growl using teeth in their stomachs.\nGhost crabs can growl at their enemies sort of a dog. crabs make fearsome noises using their teeth located within the stomachs. Ghost crabs utilize a special animal acoustic communication system.\nThey can make different sounds by striking the ground with their claws, rubbing their claws together to make a rasping sound, rubbing their legs to make a bubbly noise, and rubbing the teeth inside their stomachs to make a growling sound.\n28.Female lions do 90 percent of the hunting.\nAccording to CBS News \"Lionesses, not male lions, do the majority of hunting for their pride\".\nWhile male lions attract their fair share of attention thanks to their impressive men, it's the female lions who do the bulk of the work when it comes to feeding their families. 29. Some sharks glow in the dark.\n29. Sharks glow in the dark\nThe researchers, from Belgium and New Zealand, found that some shark species produce a glow that only other sharks can see.\nAccording to CNN this glow \"helps sharks identify each other and even fight against infection on a microbial level.\"\n30.Baby Tasmanian devils make life-long friendships.\nIf you have best friends who have been around since you were a child, then you have something in common with Baby Tasmanian devils.\nResearch has shown that Tasmanian devils form bonds when they're young, engage in friendly sleep-overs, that last for the rest of their lives.\nSo these are the 30 amazing fun facts about animals that will shock you.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Facts and Figures About the Cave Lion - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/cave-lion-1093066", "text": "The Eurasian cave lion (Panthera spelaea) is a species of lion that went extinct around 12,000 years ago. It was one of the largest species of a lion to have ever lived. Only its North American cousin, the extinct American lion (Panthera atrox), was bigger. Scientists believe the Eurasian cave lion was as much as 10% larger than the modern lion (Panthera leo). It was often depicted in cave paintings as having some kind of collar fluff and possibly stripes.\nEurasian Cave Lion Basics\nScientific Name: Panthera leo spelaea\nHabitat: Woodlands and mountains of Eurasia\nHistorical Period: Middle to late Pleistocene (approximately 700,000-12,000 years ago)\nSize and Weight: Up to 7 feet long (excluding the tail) and 700-800 pounds\nDiet: Meat\nDistinguishing Characteristics: Large size; powerful limbs; possibly manes and stripes\nWhere Did It Live?\nOne of the most ferocious predators of the late Pleistocene epoch, the Eurasian cave lion was a plus-sized cat that roamed a vast expanse of territory in Eurasia, Alaska, and part of northwestern Canada. It feasted on a wide array of mammalian megafauna, including prehistoric horses and prehistoric elephants.\nWhy Is It Called a Cave Lion?\nThe Eurasian cave lion was also a voracious predator of the cave bear (Ursus spelaeus); in fact, this cat received its name not because it lived in caves, but because numerous intact skeletons have been found in cave bear habitats. Eurasian cave lions preyed opportunistically on hibernating cave bears, which must have seemed like a good idea until their intended victims woke up.\nWhy Did It Go Extinct?\nAs is the case with many prehistoric predators, it's unclear why the Eurasian cave lion vanished off the face of the Earth about 12,000 years ago. The cave lion population might have suffered due to the severe reduction of species it preyed upon. As the climate warmed, the cave lion\u2019s habitat of wide-open spaces was shrinking as forest areas increased, putting severe pressure on the species. Human migration into Europe could also have played a role, as they would likely have been competing with lions for the same prey.\nNoteworthy Discoveries\nIn 2015, researchers in Siberia made the astonishing discovery of two frozen Eurasian cave lion cubs. The cubs were determined to be up to 55,000 years old and were named Uyan and Dina. Another cub was discovered in 2017 in the same area of Siberia; it was about 8 weeks old when it died, and it is perfectly preserved. In 2018, a fourth cave lion cub was discovered in the Siberian permafrost, this one estimated to be about 30,000 years old. The cub\u2019s body was well preserved with muscles and internal organs, including its heart, brain, and lungs, still intact. While it's not uncommon for explorers to stumble across quick-frozen woolly mammoths, these are the first instances of prehistoric cats being found in permafrost. It may be possible to recover fragments of DNA from the cave cubs' soft tissues to clone them, and that could one day facilitate the de-extinction of Panthera spelaea."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion cubs - All the important baby lion facts you should know", "url": "https://www.africa-wildlife-detective.com/lion-cubs.html", "text": "Want to know more African lion cubs facts?\nIn this post we will be looking at facts about how lion cubs are raised within the pride.\nYou will learn how they are raised by female lions in the wild, whether the fathers are involved in this process and how they are trained to be hunters themselves and much more.\nWe also unfortunately have too give you an important warning about where cubs fit in the lion hunting industry.\nWhen it is time to give birth a lioness leaves her pride and has her lion babies in dense cover.\nA female lion mother will move her new cubs to a safe den.\nThe cub gets picked up by the scruff of the neck.\nThe cub instinctively will relax its muscles and allow the mother to move it .\nMother lion protecting her cubs.\nBaby lions remain hidden for one to two months before being introduced to the rest of the pride.\nA baby lion is called a cub.\nBaby Lion life cycle\nBirth weight\n1, 5 kilograms\nEyes open\nat 3 to 11 days\nWeaning\nStarts at 10 weeks; completed at 10 months\nHunting skills achieved\nAt 2 years old\nFully grown\n3-4 years\nAll the lactating females in a pride suckle cubs showing no favoritism for their own offspring.\nThe reason for this is that each lioness is enhancing her own genes' success by helping to raise her sisters' offspring.\nWhat do lions eat?\nThe lion babies start to eat meat at about three months and are weaned at about six months.\nBecause lions are carnivores, they will eventually only eat meat as they grow up.\nThey are known as apex predators which means they are at the top of the food chain.\nFemale lions stay within the pride all their lives but male lions either leave of their own accord or are driven off by the pride males at two to three years of age.\nLion cub playing with mum.\nLion cubs spend most of their day playing which is serious business for baby lions.\nLion cubs play by stalking each other, playing hide and seek and wrestling with each other.\nWith this they develop vital skills that they will use later in life when they have to hunt for themselves.\nDo male lions help raise the baby lions?\nAfrican male lions generally play no paternal role when it comes to provisioning of food to the cubs.\nAfter two years lion cubs will be driven away from the pride by their father. While this may seem cruel, this is very important instinct which cause the father to do away with competition.\nThis action prevents inbreeding in the pride.\nLion cub with dad.\nThe responsibility for training them to hunt is also that of the mother.\nMale lions will however protect lion babies from danger.\nWhen do the cubs start hunting by themselves?\nLion babies stay with their mothers for about two years, by which stage they have joined the pride's hunting trips.\nAfter one to two years of nomadic life these young males drive out the resident males of a pride and take over the females.\nIf a small group of males leave together they are able to hunt as a group and stand a better chance of being able to take over a pride.\nFemales prefer their pride to have a large male coalition because it reduces the number of cubs lost to infanticide at take-overs.\nThe displaced male lions seldom live long since they no longer have lionesses to hunt for them.\nLionesses prefer their pride to be controlled by a large coalition of males whose strength in numbers will give them a longer tenure.\nAre white lion cubs albinos?\nWhite lion cubs are not albinos. True albino lions have no colour pigmentation at all.\nWhite lion cubs simply lack the darker pigmentation due to a rare condition that results in reduced pigmentation.\nWhite lion cub facts.\nWhite lions were first discovered in the Timbavati area of Mpumalanga in South Africa.\nIn some African countries like Botswana, white lions are symbols of royalty and seen as sacred to the Sepedi and Tsonga cultures.\nWarning: Little known facts about the lion hunting industry\nTourists to Africa think there is something very irresistible about playing with small lion cubs that a few years later will be feared predators.\nWe must however send out a warning though that you should please note that several animal activist groups have found that the petting of lion babies by tourists is directly related to canned lion hunting industry.\nWhat that means is that that cute cub you are stroking when you happen to be on an African safari is most likely to meet its end from a hunter with a high powered rifle or bow and arrow.\nIt has been found that some lion farmers rent out the cubs to tourist resorts and volunteerism organisations.\nWe understand the attraction of lion cub interaction for tourist but ask you to please do your homework about the organisations you plan to go to before you visit them.\nThe fact is that as soon as these lion cubs are too big to be handled by tourists, they are returned back to the lion farm that supplied them, only to be killed later by wealthy hunters.\nAnother lie that some of these organisations pedal is that these cubs are orphans. They will often spin you a story about their parents that were supposedly killed by poachers. Others will tell you that the cubs were supposedly rejected by their mothers.\nMost of the time the true facts indicate that the cubs were in fact removed from their mother at a very young age in order to be hand raised.\nWhen they are raised in such a way they get used to human interaction and can then be used to raise funds through tourist interaction.\nA life entertaining tourists is no life for a lion. Be very careful of the trend amongst tour operators who promote walks with lions and lion cubs petting. Those activities will cause them a lifetime of suffering.\nThe challenge unsuspecting tourists have is how to identify a facility where the lions end up at canned hunting operations or where their body parts are traded.\nThankfully the South African Tourism Services Association (SATSA) has compiled a useful guide to help visitors make these decisions which we show you in the flowchart below:\nIf you share our concerns about this practice in the lion industry please spread the news by liking this page and sharing it with your friends through social media."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion Reproduction & Offspring of the African Lion | ALERT", "url": "https://lionalert.org/lion-reproduction-offspring/", "text": "When is a lion\u2019s Breeding Season\nLions have no particular breeding season, and often synchronize breeding, especially after a pride takeover, raising the cubs communally. Birth peaks have been observed in Kruger (February \u2013 April) and Serengeti (March \u2013 July) National Parks related to seasonal weather patterns and prey availability.\nAfrican Lions Sexual Maturity\nMale lions become sexually mature at around 26 months old, but unlikely to breed before the age of four or five, primarily due to a lack of opportunity until they are large enough at around this age to take over a pride and therefore its breeding rights.\nFemales can breed until they are c. 15-years old, but reproduction usually starts to decline at 11 years. A lioness in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park gave birth at 19 years old.\nThe onset of oestrus is in response to within-pride mechanisms such as oestrus in pride mates as well as the loss of cubs from infanticide at pride takeovers. Lionesses are polyoestrus, oestrus lasting 4 \u2013 7 days with intervals between periods of a few days up to more than a year (average 55.4 days). They have post-partum oestrus but do not conceive if the litter survives. If the litter is lost a new one may be produced within four months.\nHow do lions select a partner?\nSelection may be initiated by either member of the pair who remains close during the period of a female\u2019s fertility. The female usually invites the male to have intercourse by assuming a position known as lordosis.\nThere is little competition amongst pride males during mating. Instead of fighting to be the first to mate with a fertile female, a male will follow her around very closely at the first signs of fertility onset.\nOther males keep their distance unless there is a clear size difference, in which case a larger male may fight a smaller one. This works because females have a long fertility period and copulate many times during that period. Males may lose interest before the end of the fertility period, giving patient males a chance.\nAlso, due to the common synchrony of reproduction, there is often more than one female in heat at any one time. A lioness mates up to 100 times per day with an average interval of 17 minutes (range 4 \u2013 148), each mating lasting for c. 21 seconds (range 8 \u2013 68)"}

Look no further \u2013 I\u2019ve got you covered with 9 Galapagos sea lion facts!\nGalapagos Sea Lions Are Amazing\nGalapagos sea lions are so cool! They are like real life mermaids in the water; quick and graceful. On land, though, it\u2019s a different story. Although they may still pose quite a threat if angered, they are generally slow, clumsy, and very\u2026 very\u2026 sleep-py-yy\u2026\nAlthough Galapagos sea lions are very cute, they can be very dangerous and territorial, especially around mating season.\nOn land, the sea lions will use their front and back flippers like feet and drag themselves around.\nGalapagos Sea Lions by the Numbers\nLatin name: ( Zalophus wollebaeki )\n( ) Length: 59-98 inches (150-250 cm)\n59-98 inches (150-250 cm) Weight: 110-880 lb (50-400 kg), smaller than their Californian cousins.\n110-880 lb (50-400 kg), smaller than their Californian cousins. Color: The Galapagos sea lion has a beautiful golden sheen to their brown and black coat.\nThe Galapagos sea lion has a beautiful golden sheen to their brown and black coat. Cool feature: Galapagos sea lions are endemic to the Galapagos Islands.\nWhen we were in Galapagos, I would sit in the common area at our resort and just watch the sea lions. They reminded me of adorable, lazy dogs.\n9 Cool Galapagos Sea Lion Facts\nI hope you enjoy these great Galapagos sea lion facts!\n1. Wacky Naming System\nIn English, as we know, they are called \u201csea lions.\u201d In Spanish, Galapagos sea lions are called \u201clobos del mar\u201d wich translates to \u201cwolves of the sea.\u201d\nBack to English, a male Galapagos sea lion is referred to as a \u201cbull,\u201d a female is known as a \u201ccow,\u201d and a baby is called a \u201cpup.\u201d\nSo, we\u2019ve got: lions, wolves, cattle, and dogs; all in one species! Say what?!\n2. Gimme, Gimme, Gimme!!\nGalapagos sea lions can eat, eat, eat! A male can eat 30-45 lb (13-20 kg) and a female can eat 15-25 lb (6-11 kg) \u2013 every day.\nThat\u2019s like a guy eating 63 to 94 Big Mac\u2019s every day! (Based on an average weight of 7.6oz per burger.)\n3. What Do Galapagos Sea Lions Eat?\nThe diet of the Galapagos sea lion consists of 70% sardines. Blaaaahhh! Forget the Big Macs\u2026\nSome people love sardines. It\u2019s all, \u201csardines this,\u201d and \u201csardines that.\u201d Sardines make me want to be a little bit sick. \u201cSardines\u201d starts to sound really weird the more you say (or write) it. Sardines, sardines\u2026\nBut to a sea lion sardines are fine dining!\n4. Deep Diving\nHow deep can a Galapagos sea lion dive? They tend to average about 98-196 ft (30-60 m), but some have been recorded to dive up to (down to/up to?) 328 ft (100 m)!\nTo add a bit of context, humans, equipped with scuba gear and oxygen tanks, generally refrain from venturing deeper than 100 ft (30 m).\nIf they are going to dive deeper than that, they need special gas mixtures in their tanks so they don\u2019t experience nitrogen narcosis, which can basically make a person feel and experience the symptoms of being drunk or high. Definitely a dangerous thing, especially when you\u2019re 100 ft under!\nThis definitely gives me a new appreciation for how amazing the sea lions are. They freedive up to three times deeper than most people can with all of their special gear.\nThis raises the question: how long can the Galapagos sea lion hold its breath?\n5. How Long Can Galapagos Sea Lions Hold Their Breath?\nIn short, Galapagos sea lions can hold their breath for up to 20 minutes.\nI can\u2019t even hold my breath for 1 minute! (Don\u2019t tell anyone.) In people, brain damage starts to set in after 4 minutes without oxygen. Sea lions are truly amazing!\n6. How Can I Tell Male and Female Galapagos Sea Lions Apart?\nFor one thing, the males are much, much larger than the females. Like, two or three times as big.\nThe males also develop a conspicuous bump on their foreheads when they reach the sea lion version of puberty. This makes it much easier to tell the male from the female, who has a smooth head.\n7. The Galapagos Sea Lion Is Endangered\nUnfortunately, the Galapagos sea lion is endangered. What does this really mean? Endangered means \u201clikely to become extinct.\u201d\nThere are only about 20,000-50,000 Galapagos sea lions left.\n8. \u201cI\u2019m Getting Buffed; Ripped; Toned\u201d\nOkay, so maybe their size doesn\u2019t have anything to do with their ego, but they do seem to be proud of it.\nMale Galapagos sea lions are larger than females, with a thick, strong, neck, chest, and shoulders but have a small, slender butt (\u201cabdomen\u201d). At least sea lions don\u2019t waggle their eyebrows.\nFemales, on the other hand, have longer, sleeker, necks and a thick torso.\n9. Females Bark Back and Forth With Pups\nI, for one, don\u2019t like it when my mom \u201cbarks\u201d at me. Fortunately, this doesn\u2019t happen very often. For sea lions, though, this is the primary means of communication between mother and pup.\nAs soon as they are born, a mother sea lion knows her pup\u2019s unique bark and can find him/her in a crowd of 30 or more barking sea lions. A mother will also bark to warn her pup of an approaching shark or other danger.\nAre Galapagos Sea Lions Dangerous?\n\u201cHow could something so sweet-looking possibly be dangerous?\u201d That was my first thought.\nHowever, sea lions can be very dangerous, especially the males in mating season. Why? They are very territorial and may view you as a threat.\nWhen sea lions fight with each other, it\u2019s scary to see. It can get very bloody and violent. If you\u2019ve ever seen two males fight, it will definitely teach you to respect these giants animals.\nThey are called sea LIONS for a reason. However, if you show them the respect that they deserve, you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble.\nThere\u2019s an awesome fish market on Santa Cruz (Galapagos) where there are tons of sea lions and you can see them up close. The pictures above and below are from that market.\nDon\u2019t Freak Out!\nWhile they are dangerous, they don\u2019t attack people \u2013 unless the people are being world-class idiots.\nSo just follow your guide\u2019s instructions and you\u2019ll be fine! I even got to snorkel with a juvenile male, who was not aggressive at all. It was totally awesome!\nGalapagos Sea-ya-later Lion!\nI hope you enjoyed my 9 awesome Galapagos sea lion facts!

Turtles, water snakes, crocodiles, alligators, dolphins, whales, and other water going creatures will drown if kept underwater too long. Almost half the pigs in the world are kept by farmers in China. On average, dogs have better eyesight than humans, although not as colorful. Deer have no gall bladders. There is an average of 50,000 spiders per acre in green areas. Snakes are carnivores, which means they only eat animals, often small ones such as insects, birds, frogs and other small mammals. In Alaska it is illegal to whisper in someone\u2019s ear while they\u2019re moose hunting. The bat is the only mammal that can fly. The leg bones of a bat are so thin that no bat can walk. Some male songbirds sing more than 2000 times each day. The only mammals to undergo menopause are elephants, humpback whales and human females. Blue-eyed lemurs are one of two (non-human) primates to have truly blue eyes. A tarantula spider can survive for more than two years without food. For every human in the world there are one million ants. If you lift a kangaroo\u2019s tail off the ground it can\u2019t hop \u2013 they use their tails for balance. If you keep a goldfish. in a dark room, it will become pale! Cows can sleep standing up, but they can only dream lying down. The sentence \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\u201d uses every letter of the alphabet. The average fox weighs 14 pounds. The scientific name of the red fox is Vulpes vulpes. Alligators can live up to 100 years. A single elephant tooth can weigh as much as 9 pounds. The turkey is one of the most famous birds in North America. A housefly hums in the key of F. During World War II, Americans tried to train bats to drop bombs. Canis lupus lupus is the scientific name for a grey wolf. To escape the grip of a crocodile\u2019s jaw, push your thumb into its eyeballs-it will let you go instantly. It is much easier for dogs to learn spoken commands if they are given in conjunction with hand signals or gestures. Even a small amount of alcohol placed on a scorpion will make it go crazy and sting itself to death! Male rabbits are called \u201cbucks,\u201d females are \u201cdoes.\u201d The flamingo can only eat when its head is upside down. Animals generate 30 times more waste than humans which is 1.4 billion tons every year. Ants never sleep. Also they don\u2019t have lungs. A group of owls is called a parliament. Just one cow gives off enough harmful methane gas in a single day to fill around 400 litre bottles. Apple and pear seeds contain arsenic, which may be deadly to dogs. Cows have one large stomach that is divided into four compartments to go through the different stages of digestion. An anteater is nearly 6 feet long, yet its mouth is only an inch wide. The blue whale weighs as much as thirty elephants and is as long as three Greyhound buses. A herd of sixty cows is capable of producing a ton of milk in less than a day. A grasshopper can leap 20 times the length of its own body. At birth, baby kangaroos are only about an inch long \u2013 no bigger than a large water bug or a queen bee.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "African Animal Facts - About Big Five Wildlife", "url": "https://www.africanbudgetsafaris.com/blog/did-you-know-fascinating-facts-about-african-animals/", "text": "Prepare to discover loads of interesting facts about African animals of all shapes and sizes! These are some of the many intriguing things I learnt as a safari guide in Kruger and on my past travels.\nAs a child growing up in South Africa, I heard and read a lot about animals. There are some lovely African Tales about most of these animals. As I share animals facts below, I will also list the names of African Tales for you to look out for. These tales are great for children so look them up!\nMost people go on wildlife safaris with the aim of spotting the Big 5 of Africa. Thus, I'll start off with some interesting facts about the Big 5 safari animals.\nFacts About the Big 5 Animals of Africa\nFirst, let's get the facts straight about the term \"Big Five\". Contrary to popular belief, the term Big Five does not indicate that these are the 5 biggest animals in Africa. These are, in fact, the 5 most dangerous animals a person can encounter in the bush when on foot. This was originally a hunting term which was later adopted by the tourism industry. Now spotting the Big 5 of Africa has become the main aim of going on an African safari for many.\nInteresting Lion Facts - about the king of the beasts\n1. Possibly the most social of the cat family, lions typically live in large families. They do everything as a group (called a pride), except for the males who regularly patrol their territories to fend against other lions.\nMale lion\n2. A lion's roar can be heard over 8km away. Lions are able to roar so loudly due to a ligament in their voice box. This ligament is stretched to enable more air to pass across the vocal cords, making the incredibly deep and loud sounds. This is also the same for other large cats like leopards, tigers and jaguars.\n3. Lions have a white line right underneath their eyes which assists them with night vision. There is a reflective coating behind the eye which helps to amplify the light emitted by stars and the moon. With this help, a lion\u2019s eyesight is 8 times better than that of humans at night.\nLion eyes\n4. Lions can sleep, or at least rest for up to 20 hours per day. A big part of why they sleep so much is to conserve energy for when it is needed - for hunting and defending territories.\nLion sleeping\nAfrican Tale with Lions: The story of lion and jackal\nInteresting Leopard Facts \u2013 about the elusive predator\n1. The leopard is probably the most adaptable of the big cats when it comes to human interference. This is the main reason why leopards are spotted close to urban areas. Their adaptability also makes them the most widely distributed wild cat on the planet.\n2. Leopards have strong necks, which allow them to drag prey (that weighs more than themselves) into trees. They do this in order to hide it from other predators.\n3. Leopards scavenge regularly but are brilliant hunters.\n4. Leopard cubs are born blind and are therefore completely dependent on their mothers. Their eyes start opening about 10 days after birth. Cubs typically stay with their mothers for up to about 2 years.\nLeopard and cub\n5. A leopard\u2019s tail is almost the same length as its body. Their long tails mainly assist them with balance when climbing, as well as serving as a rudder when they are chasing prey and have to turn sharply.\nLeopard hunting\nAfrican Tale about Leopards: How the leopard got his spots\nInteresting Elephant Facts \u2013 about the gentle giants\n1. Elephants are the largest land-based mammal in the world and are found in Africa and Asia.\n2. Elephants are highly social animals. They live in herds which are led by an older female matriarch. These herds are usually family herds made up of elephants of all different ages.\nAmboseli elephants\n3. Adult male elephants, or bulls, normally move freely between different family herds.\n4. African elephants' ears are shaped like the continent of Africa and play an important role in cooling elephants down. On very hot days, elephants like to spray water or put mud behind their ears where there are lots of small veins. This cools the veins helping the elephants to cool down. In the heat, elephants tend to constantly flap their ears which in turn cools down their bodies. So their ears and the veins work like an air conditioning unit.\nElephant in the savannah, in namibia\n5. Did you know that elephants are either right-handed or left-handed? One can see this when looking at their tusks. They normally have one tusk which is broken or more worn than the other. This indicates that they prefer using that specific tusk making them either left or right-handed.\n6. Elephants have very complex and intricate ways of communicating. These include using vibrations to make sounds. Some of which are audible to humans and some of which are not. These sounds can travel for several kilometres. They also communicate through visual signals and touch.\nElephants in namibia\n7. The average daily food intake of an elephant is between 150 kg to 300 kg per day, and when drinking they can consume between 100 and 200 litres of water. This is why having too many elephants in a game park that isn't large enough can wreak havoc on the vegetation and ecosystem as a whole.\nAfrican Tale about Elephants: Why elephant has a trunk\nInteresting Rhino Facts \u2013 about nature's real-life unicorns\n1. A group of rhinos is actually called a crash.\nRhino (2)\n2. In Africa, we have the white (square-lipped rhinoceros) and the black rhinoceros (hook- lipped rhinoceros) however, their actual colours are very similar. In my life as a guide, I heard numerous reasons for these names. I guess the one that makes the most sense is that the names originated from when the Dutch settlers in Africa called the white rhinos \u201cwijd\u201d. This actually means wide \u2013 referring to the wide jaw of the white rhino \u2013 but it sounded like \u201cwhite\u201d to English speakers, and was therefore translated incorrectly.\n3. Rhinos are very fast for their size. White rhino males can weigh more than 2 tons and can run at a speed of 40km per hour.\n4. Their horns are made from keratin, which is the same material human nails are made of. Rhinos are primarily hunted for their horns despite the fact that their horns do not have any proven medicinal properties.\nRhino horns\n5. Like elephants, rhinoceroses communicate using infrasonic frequencies that are below the human threshold of hearing.\n6. Like humans, the skin of a rhino is very sensitive to the sun. Thus they love taking mud baths to cover their skin. This also helps to trap ticks and other parasites - once the mud dries up, they scratch against a tree which then removes these parasites.\nRhino mud bath\nAfrican Tale about Rhinos: How the rhinoceros got his skin\nInteresting Buffalo Facts \u2013 teamwork at its best\n1. The buffalo is oddly-enough seen as one of the most dangerous of the Big 5. This has a lot to do with the fact that other animals usually show some warning signs before they attack. This is not so with the buffalo. They rarely give any warning signals and can surround you without being noticed.\n2. Buffalo are usually found in large herds, sometimes hundreds of animals in one herd. These huge herds are often closely followed by lions. So much so that you are almost certain to find lion when you see a large herd of buffalos. When these herds get attacked by lions, they form a circle around their young, facing outward towards the threat to form a barricade of horns.\nBuffalo herd\n3. Buffalo are actually very good swimmers, as they often cross large rivers to find good grazing fields. One also often sees lonely buffalo bulls (also known as dagga boys) lying in water and mud. The name dagga boy comes from the word \u201cdagga\u201d which refers to a cement mixture used in building houses. These solitary buffalo bulls usually look like they have cement patches on their bodies from the mud.\n4. Buffalos have a good symbiotic relationship with many bird species, like the oxpecker and also egrets. You are sure to find a variety of birds when looking at a herd of buffalo.\nBuffalo and bird\nAfrican Tale about Buffalos: The tale of oxpecker and buffalo\nFacts About the Little 5 Animals of Africa\nA lesser-known grouping of smaller animals that we have in Africa, is the Little 5. These are in fact 5 smaller animals that share their names with the animals of the Big 5 grouping. Here are the Little 5 animals...\n1. Antlion:\nThe largest of the lacewing family. They look very similar to dragonflies.\nAntlion by Bernard DUPONT\nTheir larvae are found all over Southern Africa in soft sand and they stay in funnel-shaped pits, used to catch their prey. They sit at the bottom of the pit hidden in the sand, and when they detect an insect entering the pit, they throw sand towards them to make the prey fall to the bottom. Here they grab their prey with their large jaws.\n2. Leopard tortoise:\nThe largest tortoise found in Southern Africa.\nLeopard Tortoise by Bernard Dupont\nThey have unique markings on their shells. They are mostly plant eaters, however, they often gnaw on bones and also eat hyena droppings. They do this to get calcium and other minerals which assist in eggshell production and keep their own shells in good condition.\n3. Elephant shrew:\nSo-called because of their rather long and flexible noses which look similar to the elephant\u2019s trunk.\nElephant shrew by Javier Abalos\nThey eat invertebrates and also fruit, seeds and leaves. The females usually carry food to their young in their cheek pouches.\n4. Rhinoceros beetle:\nThese beetles can reach up to 60 millimetres in size and their name originates from the horns on their head.\nRhino beetle by Bernard Dupont\nThe males use these horns to fight each other for territory and for possession of females. They are part of the scarab family. There are over 300 types of rhino beetles worldwide. It is known to be the strongest animal as it can carry up to 850 times its own body weight\n5. Buffalo weaver:\nKnown as 'buffalo' weavers for following buffalo herds to feed on the insects disturbed by the buffalos' movements.\nRed-billed buffalo weaver by Derek Keats\nThese weavers are communal and live in large colonies. They use thorny twigs to make large nests which are divided into different compartments to create egg chambers.\nInteresting Facts about other African Animals\nPangolin or scaly anteater:\nThe only animal in the world that is completely covered in scales.\nPangolin by Adam Tusk\nThese scales are made from keratin (like rhino horns) and these scales contribute to 20% of the animal's overall weight.\nPangolins have a long sticky tongue that grows from deep inside their chest cavity and can extend to over 40cm, which is longer than its own body!\nThey are able to close their nose and ears when feeding in order to keep ants from entering.\nAfrican Tale on Pangolins: How the Pangolin got its scales\nOstrich:\nThese funny looking birds are somewhat prehistoric in appearance.\nOstrich by Bernard Dupont\nEven though they have a wingspan of up to 2 meters, they are completely flightless. They mainly use their wings for a mating display, and to help counterbalance when running away from predators.\nThey can run up to 70 km per hour, which makes them the fastest living animal and bird on two legs.\nThey have three stomachs, and regularly swallow stones and pebbles. The pebbles help ostriches to grind-up food in their first stomach, as they do not have teeth to chew.\nThe brain of an ostrich weighs around 40 grams, compared to one of their eyes that weighs around 60 grams. They, therefore, have fabulous eyesight and can see up to 3 and a half kilometres.\nAn ostrich egg is equivalent to 24 hen eggs and takes about one and a half hours to hard boil.\nThey do not stick their heads in the sand or the ground \u2013 this is an urban myth. When in danger, ostriches normally run away, but they also have powerful legs and can kick potential predators.\nThe male ostrich is called a rooster, and a female is called a hen. A group of ostriches is called a flock.\nMales and females both roost on their eggs. With the black colour of the male feathers, they are well camouflaged for roosting during the night, and then females roost during the day.\nAfrican Tale on Ostriches: How the ostrich got its long neck\nBlack-Backed Jackal:\nPeople who have been into the bushveld know all about the distinctive sounds these animals make around sunset.\nBlack-backed jackal\nThey are monogamous, which means that they mate for life, and only hold one partner.\nThey are omnivorous as their diets regularly include berries and grass. They scavenge a lot, but they are known to catch small prey like rodents and birds. One usually sees them following lions as they hunt, at a distance. They regularly creep up to lions' prey in order to steal a bit of meat.\nAfrican Tale about Jackal: Clever Jackal gets away\nMarabou Stork:\nIn my view, this is possibly the ugliest bird around, a real thing out of nightmares.\nMarabou Stork by John Cooke\nMarabou storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with a long, bare pink gular sac.\nThey are large birds and can reach an average size of about 152cm, and have a wingspan of around 3.7m. On average they weigh around 9kg.\nThey are not very vocal but indulges in bill-rattling courtship displays. The throat sac is also used to make various noises during mating time.\nThey have tall legs that are often white in colour however, their legs are not white at all \u2013 the whiteness is due to them defecating on their own legs, which is known as urohydrosis. This is mainly to regulate their body temperatures as it cools down the body.\nThe birds are known to build their nests in trees and sometimes even in tall buildings. The female usually lay between three to five eggs. Both the parents are equally involved in taking care of the young, however, only one out of four reaches adulthood.\nTheir diets mainly consist of carrion, fish, insects, frogs, snakes, lizards, mice and other rodents, even other birds.\nI am going to end off with some interesting facts on my personal favourite animal, the African wild dog. Also known as the painted dog or painted wolf.\nAfrican Wild Dog:\nAfrican wild dogs by Derek Keats\nThey have distinctive patterns on their fur, and no two wild dogs have the same patterns.\nThey usually live in large packs, which are dominated by the matriarch. They have an alpha pair (almost like a king and a queen) and these are usually the only ones in the pack who mate. Once the pups are born, the whole pack looks after them and they take priority. Pups that are old enough to eat solid food are given priority at a kill \u2013 even over the dominant pair.\nThey have massively large roaming areas and are known to roam around 50km in a day.\nWhen hunting, they have about an 80% success rate and hunt in groups which are well coordinated. Their main hunting strategy is to outrun an animal tiring it out over a very long distance. Like with cycling races, when the front runners get tired, then the dogs right behind them pick up speed and the front runners fall back a bit. Usually, after a few kilometres of running, the prey gets very tired and weak, which makes it easier to take down.\nIt has been documented that they have similar social and hunting habits to wolves.\nWild dogs\nThey are sadly an endangered species \u2013 they used to range across 39 countries in Africa, with population numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Currently, there are fewer than 6,000 individuals left in the wild, forming fewer than 700 packs.\nI was not able to get African tales for all of the animals mentioned, however, for the little ones, there are a few books published on African tales. I recommend looking out for some of these, as they are lovely stories. Some recommended books:\nStories of Africa by Gcina Mhlope\nAfrican Animal Tales by Jay P.W. Heale\nNumerous short stories and books by Mwenye Hadithi\nWith all these interesting African animal facts, I'm sure your next wildlife safari will be even more fun and interesting!\nFor help planning your next African Safari on a budget contact our travel experts."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Amazing Physical and Behavioral Adaptations of African Lions - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/adaptations-of-african-lions", "text": "African lions are one of the biggest cats in the world. To ensure survival, their body has been going through several changes to fight difficult situations and emerge as a winner.\nAfrican lions are the largest carnivorous animals found in Africa. They belong to the family of cats and are the largest ones in the group. Their body is around 1.4-2 m long, with a 67-100 cm long tail. They are mammals who live in groups known as prides and are the only cats to display sexual dimorphism i.e., males and females can be easily distinguished by physical appearance and behavior.\nEvery animal has to adapt itself physically and behaviorally to survive in a particular environment. African lions have also struggled for several years to develop adaptations that have helped them to survive in the long run. African lion adaptations can be divided into two categories; physical and behavioral. Structural modifications in the body fall under physical category, while reactions of the animal in response to an external stimuli come under behavioral category. So let\u2019s have a look at the adaptations these wild African cats have developed to live on, in the savannas.\nPhysical Adaptations\nSharp Claws\nLarge and sharp claws is one of the best adaptations of African lions. They use their sharp claws to catch hold of their prey and tear meat from the prey\u2019s body, after it has been killed. Sharp claws are also used for defense and to display strength to other animals. Claws also provide the required grip to lions so that they can easily gain speed while running.\nSharp Teeth\nThe most visible and striking adaptation is sharp teeth. Like other carnivores, lions also rely on meat to meet their dietary requirements. Dull teeth are not capable for providing the grip to tear and chew meat, that is why, lions have sharp teeth so that they do not have any problem in eating food. Another use of sharp teeth is defense. In case of a fight, teeth help them to defend and survive.\nWhiskers\nWhiskers act as feelers and allows the animal to sense its surroundings, and find its way out through tight spots. When a lion is on hunt, these whiskers help it to sense the prey. These also help in sensing whether it can fit into a particular area or not.\nTan Fur Color\nAfrican lions have tan-colored fur on their body. This fur color is an adaptation to meet certain requirements. The tan color helps it to blend with the surrounding color which prevents its camouflage. If the color of the fur was different, then it would have been difficult for lions to survive in grasslands.\nBehavioral Adaptations\nVocalizations\nThis is an adaptation lions have developed to communicate within their group. They hum when content and puff when they approach each other with good intentions. Grunting is a sound they produce to keep in touch when they are moving from one area to the other. Females roar to protect their cubs from other animals or when they call other females to help fight the intruders off. Males roar to specify their location, display their strength, and signal other animals to stay away from the pride.\nNocturnal Hunting\nThis species of lions is nocturnal and prefer to hunt in the darkness of the night. They often hunt for food in groups and females do all the hunting. The strength of the group is generally determined by the amount of food the pride has. Another reason for hunting during the night is that lions get tired very quickly due to their muscular body. That is why they spend nearly 20 hours of a day resting. Hunting at night provides them relief from heat during the day.\nFamily Life\nMothers take care of the cubs and keep them hidden from other animals for about eight weeks. Nursing mothers form groups, and take care of other cubs as well in their mother\u2019s absence. In tough situations, when the pride does not have enough food, mothers abandon their cubs and move ahead. This is done so that females remain within the pride and can again give birth to young ones at times when the pride has enough food for all its members.\nTaking Lessons\nLike human beings, these lions teach their young ones ways to live and survive. By the time a cub is three months old, the mother teaches it ways to hunt for food. The young cub observes adult members of the family and learns to look for and hunt its prey. Cubs become experts in hunting only after they are 2-3 years old. The male cubs are forced to move out of the pride after 2 years, and find a new pride for themselves. Females stay in the group to have their own cubs in the future.\nAfrican lion facts reveal that their population has reduced by 30% due to killing. It is feared to reduce further due to extreme climatic changes to which the species have not yet adapted with. However, the adaptations mentioned above have helped them to fight difficult situations in the past and survive in the land of savannas."}

Rather, they associate with each other to the limited time interval at the mating season.\nHunting is a general cooperative activity among their other behavior but the male Asiatic lions or the old adult lions rarely take part. They possess small pride. It is their choice to mostly hunt at night.\nThe male lion doesn\u2019t seek for a large group and prefers to be with their 2 or 3 female loins. For the activities like hunting, feeding and various other such requirements, female lioness travels with the pair of male lions.\nWhereas, the lioness go for a heavy group of around 10 to 12 lioness along with their cubs. But, when it comes to being with their counterparts they are rarely found to do so. Male Asiatic Lion spends up to 20 hours per day resting or sleeping therefore, they are almost inactive for most of the day time.\nHow Asiatic Lion is different than African Lion\nSome of the behavior and characteristics possessed by these two species of lions are similar to each other because they are from the same Felidae Family. Whereas, they also consist of various different and distinct features as well.\nAfrican lions generally cooperate with each other in numerous activities on a daily basis. They usually tend to be together while it comes about to hunt or travel.\nIt has also been found that mostly the African lions typically tend to live and spend most of the time with the lioness of their pride.\nUnlike this social behavior of the African lions, the Asiatic lions do not generally tend to live with their counterparts. These amazing species always prefer small pride. They associate with their lioness at the interval or the season of mating.\nOn the comparison of the size, Asian lions tend to be smaller in size if compared to African lions. Asiatic male lions consist of a short, sparse and darker mane than the African lions having a fuller mane.\nThe unique characteristic of the longitudinal fold of skin is completely absent in African lions.\nAsiatic Lion Population 2020 \u2013 Asiatic Lion Census\nThe population of Asiatic lions has been a point of concern over the past few decades, But we have seen a rise in the population of Asiatic lions in the last one decade.\nRecently, the result of the Asiatic Lion Census 2020 has shown an increase of 29% in the population from the last census held in 2015.\nThe total population of Asiatic lion in Gujarat as per the recent census is 674, which is 29% more than that of 2015 Lion Census. In the 674 count, there are 260 Females lioness, 162 Male Asiatic Lions, 93 Sub Adults and 137 Lions Cubs are there.\nThe counting was carries out Gir National Park and other area of Saurashtra. Surendranager and Morbi are two new districts where the Asiatic Lions have been found.\nThe counting of Lions have been done with the help of 1400 forest personnel using the block count method in the cluster of villages.\nAmazing facts about Asiatic lions\nThere are various interesting and attention-seeking facts about these amazing big cat species. Let us have a look\nAs mentioned, this wild population is only found in one place in the world. This place is the Gir Forests of Gujarat, India. They wander in a group called \u2018Pride\u2019 generally comprise of 7 \u2013 14 Lions. It has been noticed that one member among the other lions in the pride tends to be dominating upon others. Mostly the hunting activity among these Leo species is done by the female lions. The male member takes part in hunting only if the prey is highly aggressive or too strong to be trapped. Again an interesting and unique feature is related to their walking style. This is because whenever they walk, their heels avoid any contact with the ground. This type of fact is general in many species of animals, similarly in the Asiatic lions, sometimes the male lions kill or eat up the cubs of the pride or sometimes their own babies as well. The most suitable time when you will find the lions to wander around will be early morning or evening time. Like the other wild animals, these big cats also do not prefer the crowd around them.\nWhere to see Asiatic Lion?\nIf, you are planning to watch this amazing big cat species. Then there is no need to rethink to plan a trip to such a mesmerizing place. Our country India is allowing or providing this great opportunity to all the visitors and tourists with numerous available facilities\nIndia is the only place where you can see Asiatic Lions in their natural habitat. This wild population is highly in danger nowadays due to its small population.\nGujarat is the only place to have a live glimpse of this amazing big cat . Except that of Africa (where you can see their cousins, \u2018African Lions\u2019), their only home is the Sasan Gir National Park and the wildlife Sanctuary of Gujarat.\nA very small quantity or population of Asiatic Lions exists in the Gir forest, other than that Africa is the place where we can see the subspecies of these Asian lions called African Lions. African lions exist in sub-Saharan Africa. This is the reason why we used to emphasize the similarities and differences between African and Asian lions. They both are the subspecies of the same species.\nOn a finger count, if roughly examined, only 20000 lions are still left in the world.\nThe Best time to see Asiatic Lion?\nIt is one of the most prominent questions which is asked by all the visitors. Most probably there is a range of months with a quiet small interval of the time period.\nGenerally, the summers are the best season to explore the Gir in Gujarat to see Asiatic Lions. The two months namely, April and May are very hot but considered as the best months to spot Asiatic Lions in the wild.\nThe time interval of 16th June to 15th October is the duration when the Gir National Park is closed every year. The other best time to visit is the time interval between the months of December to March when the climate is pleasant.\nThis is a piece of important information that must be noticeable to every person who has the desire to visit such a delightful place. The tourists can mostly spot the amazing species during summers.\nAfter knowing the best time to visit, it is mandatory for you to know about the way to reach the place along with some specific instructions regarding the place.\nThe Gir park is situated at an approximate distance of 65 Kms from Junagarh and 40 Kms from Veraval railhead. Via both road and rail network Sasan Gir is well connected to Ahmedabad . However, the road network Gir from Ahmedabad takes around 07 hrs only to make you reach your destination .\nThere are large quantities of options for laid-back stay in Gir Forest Reserve. The accommodation option runs the gamut from budget to luxury hotels and much more reliable options in between the way for you as a tourist. You must also know that the forest department operates two lodges, the Sinh Sadan Forest Lodge and the Gir Lodge.\nThreats to Asiatic Lions\nOn the IUCN red list, this rare species of the world is highly endangered and is way ahead for its extinction. As an individual, we all must have awareness about the threats to these lions and also must take the initiative to save them.\nThe saddest part is that the habitat of this endangered species has been snatched by the humans.\nThe cruel and inhumane nature of the residents has been recorded by the authorities various times.\nTherefore, the harassment of these lions is one of the primary threats to these king of jungles.\nUncovered areas and open walls are important questions against their safety.\nAround the areas of their habitat, electrification has been recorded as a dangerous activity because it harms the innocent lions.\nActivities like mining and excavation must be avoided as they are harmful to the population of these lions.\nAbstract\nWe all have to take planned steps to help to save these king of jungles. Various projects of the government are working on the way to save the population of Asiatic Lion from extinction."}

Among the Pinnipeds, this creature is smaller in size compared to the elephant seal and the walrus. Named after Georg Steller, the naturalist who described the mammal in 1741, the sea lion lives in the North Pacific Ocean. This species is classified as near threatened by the IUCN since they are considered endangered and could face extinction at any time in the future.\nReproduction\nThe sea lions are polygamous and sexually dimorphic, meaning that the breeding male lions exhibit some significant differences from the female. These creatures gather seasonally on the rookeries to breed and pup, and the males start defending their territories in May before the pregnant Steller lions come to give birth and breed. The females always give birth to one pup from May every year to mid-July, and breeding begins two weeks after giving birth. Their gestation period begins in October. A newborn Steller sea lion weighs between 35 and 50 pounds and stays with its mother on the rookeries for some few months before leaving to look for food.\nBehavior\nThe Steller sea lions live in a vast group just like many other species. These animals communicate using a wide variety of sounds, and female sea lions recognize their young ones by smell and touch. The sea lions feed on a variety of invertebrates and fishes.\nHabitat and Range\nThe Steller sea lion is found all over the northern Pacific Ocean from northern California to northern Japan. These animals breed along the rim of the north Pacific from Kuril Island in Japan to Ano Nuevo Island, California. The sea lion congregates on the rookery sites of different surfaces from rock ledge to sandy beaches on the island. Previously the largest rookeries were in the Alaskan Gulf and the Aleutian Islands, but now they are in British Columbia and the southeastern part of Alaska because of the decline in the Western Alaska sea lion population which started in the 1970s. Although long distance and seasonal movements in response to weather patterns and prey availability are frequent, these animals rarely undertake great migrations.\nDiet\nAlthough sea lions consume a wide variety of food present in the water, what they eat depends on the season and where they live. Their typical diet includes different types of fishes, invertebrates, and smaller sea lions or other small species if their other food sources are scarce.\nDescription\nThe coloration of the adult sea lion ranges from pale yellow to tawny or even reddish. Newborn pups are black and their color stays that way for many months. Both male Steller sea lions and their female counterparts grow swiftly until their 5th year when the growth rate of the female reduces. The male increases in size until their 8th year when their sexual traits begin to appear. Adult females are between 7.5 to 9.5 feet long and weigh between 530-770lbs. Males weigh from 990 to 2,470lbs with a length of between 9.3 feet to 10.7 feet. Males have wider necks and chests, flatter snouts, broader foreheads, and thick coarse hair around their necks."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Australian Sea Lion - Facts, Diet, Habitat & Pictures on Animalia.bio", "url": "https://animalia.bio/australian-sea-lion", "text": "Habits and Lifestyle\nThe sea lions are mainly diurnal. They are highly sociable and communicative animals, gathering in large colonies on the land. They also congregate into more intimate social units \u2013 subgroups - that contain 10-15 individuals on average. They can move from one subgroup to another, depending on their needs. Since the sea lions are non-migratory animals, they usually remain near to their birthplace throughout the life, living and breeding on sandy beaches. Looking for food, they can dive up to 600 feet, staying up to 40 minutes under the water. Some sea lions have been known to swallow small stones: perhaps, it\u2019s done to balance the weight when diving under the water."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "California Sea Lion Facts: Animals of North America - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/california-sea-lion-facts-animals-of-north-america.html", "text": "5. Physical Description\nCalifornia sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are a species of \"coastal eared seals\". They exhibit sexual dimorphism, wherein adult males usually have body sizes that are 1.2 times longer, and weights that are 3-4 times higher, than those of the females.They have an average size ranging between 5.5 and 7.25 feet (1.7 and 2.2 meters) and average weights ranging between 610 to 860 pounds (275 to 390 kilograms). The coat color of these animals varies between chocolate brown in males to golden brown in females. Males develop a sagittal crest at the age of about 5 years, which initially appears as a bump upon their heads. The streamlined body and well-formed flippers of these sea lions allow them to adapt well to their aquatic habitats. Thick layers of blubber insulate their bodies against the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean.\n4. Diet\nThe California sea lion has an extremely flexible diet with a large prey base. This varies as they change their location. Usually, they feed on four to five species that are locally abundant in, and specific to, any given region. Fish, squids, and clams are all parts of the diets of these sea lions throughout much of their range. Pacific Sardines, Jack Mackerels, Red Octopuses, and Northern Anchovies are some of the species most commonly consumed by these animals in the California region. The primary prey base of the sea lions in the Sea of Cortez along the Mexican shore includes the Plainfin Midshipman, the Deepwater Serrano, the Pacific Cutlassfish, and other local marine species. They usually forage along the coastlines and the waters above the continental shelf zone, as well as venturing further towards the bottom of the ocean, though less frequently.\n3. Habitat and Range\nThe California sea lions inhabit the waters of the Pacific Ocean ocean over the continental shelf and slope zones. They are often spotted in river mouths, bays, and the sandy or rocky shores of harbor areas. California sea lions thrive along the western coastline of North America, and have been spotted as far north as the Gulf of Alaska to as far south as Punta San Pedrillo, Costa Rica. Rookeries (breeding colonies) of these animals can be observed from the islands located in Baja California Sur (Mexico) to those further north in southern California (U.S.). This species has been classified under the \u2018Least Concern\u2019 category by IUCN, due to their widespread and growing population size. Nonetheless, irresponsible fishing practices, poaching, and natural disasters, including El Ni\u00f1o-related weather events, account for significant contributions to the mortality rates of these sea lions. Killer whales and large sharks are the natural predators of this species.\n2. Behavior\nCalifornia sea lions are highly intelligent and playful. They can remain at sea for about 14 days in a single stretch, during which time they migrate or forage, either alone or in groups. Such sea trips are usually followed by \u2018haul-out\u2019 phases, when the sea lions rest themselves at specific locations along the shore. After the breeding season, adolescent and adult male sea lions usually migrate northwards, some reaching as far north as Oregon or even British Columbia. The females, however, will continue to forage in the waters closer to the rookeries. Females and juveniles undergo molting during fall and winter, while males usually molt during the months of January and February. The California sea lions have for long been the object of important scientific research due to their high cognitive abilities. The animals have been popularly used by circuses and marine mammal parks for entertainment purposes due to their abilities to quickly learn performance tricks. Animal welfare organizations, however, continue to criticize the use of these animals for such purposes.\n1. Reproduction\nThe California Sea Lions attain sexual maturity at about 4 to 5 years of age. Breeding takes place during the summer months of May to July. Males strictly defend their territories, often even fasting (abstaining from food) to maintain their positions within their respective rookeries. During this time, they depend on their blubber as a stored energy source. Females choose their mates by moving from one male-occupied territory to another within a rookery. With a gestation period of 11 months and only a single pup produced by a female in a year, the growth rate of these animals is quite slow. The newborn pups are tended by their mothers for a period of about 10 days, after which time the females start moving back into the waters for foraging purpose. They sometimes forage for as long as 3 days, while the pups remain on shore and play or socialize amongst themselves. The females return again to nurse their pups for short intervals, generally lasting no longer than a day. The mother and pup communication is distinct for each pair and, after a certain stage, the pups start entering the waters with their mother to develop their own foraging skills. Adult male sea lions have little role to play in raising the pups, but show a relatively higher level of involvement than males of other otariid (Eared seal) species."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Desert Animals - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Desert-animals.html", "text": "desert Animals\nDesert animals survive in some of the most brutal of Earths environments with amazing physical adaptions.\nSpecial bodies for special circumstances help keep creatures like the camel and the meerkat alive and well in habitats and conditions that seem inhospitable.\nWhat is a desert? And what are these unique tools that help these desert animals survive?\nWell the adaptions of desert animals isn't as simple as handling the extreme heat, because although extreme temperatures occur, the definition of a desert is an environment with a lack of precipitation, a lack of water, not high temperatures. In fact, it can get very cold in the desert - and it can even snow!\nHere are just some of the incredible animals that live in the desert, and call places like the Mojave, the Sahara and the Gobi their home...\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nwhat is a desert?\nThe word \"desert\" may make you think of sand dunes and excruciating heat, but only about 1/4 of the world's deserts are covered in sand, and parts of Antarctica engulfed in freezing ice and snow actually qualify as desert. The factor that truly determines a desert is how dry it is, not how hot it is.\nThere are two common explanations for what a desert is. The most common is an area that receives less than 10 inches of rain annually.\nThe other, and perhaps more technical and scientifically accepted explanation of what a desert is, involves evaporation. According to the Koppen system of climate classification, a desert is any area where more water is lost through evaporation than is gained through precipitation.\nUltimately, the amount of rain or snow varies greatly in deserts.\nSome, like the Chihuahuan desert, which makes up a large part of the South West United States and Northern Mexico, has a summer monsoon season of heavy rains, but the rest of the year is nearly completely dry.\nSome areas like Cairo, Eqypt have very meager rainfall scattered throughout the year, with slight, seasonal peaks and valleys.\nAnd some areas, like Dry Valleys, Antarctica, have not had any precipitation in about 2 million years.\nGenerally, low rainfall means limited growth potential for plant-life. Because there are less roots in the soil, the landscape becomes less permanent, and hills and dunes may be formed, moved and made to disappear by strong winds.\nAnother idea about deserts is that they are barren, and unable to support life, but actually many people and animals live and thrive in many desert environments, having adapted in various fascinating ways to their special home.\nAnd consider that human civilization was born in the deserts of the Middle East.\nDoes it snow in the desert?\nBactrian camels in the snow\nRemember, temperature is not the factor that decides whether a region is desert or not, and some of the coldest places on Earth are desert. So yes, it certainly does snow in the desert.\nIn fact, it snowed 3 years in a row in Saudi Arabia from 2013 to 2015. Some arctic deserts are so cold that snowfall hasn't melted in thousands of years, and one of the most famous of all desert animals the Bactrian camel, (the one with 2 humps!) is native to the mountains of the Gobi desert, where snow is fairly common.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Penguin Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/penguins/", "text": "Penguin Profile\nPenguins are flightless, aquatic birds that spend half their lives in water, and on land. They mainly habitat the Southern Hemisphere, with only the Galapagos penguin, north of the equator.\nThey are members of the order Sphenisciformes and family Spheniscidae, and the number of extant penguin species is debated, somewhere between 17 \u2013 20 current living species in total.\nPenguin Facts Overview\nHabitat: Southern Hemisphere & Galapagos Islands Location: Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, and South Africa Lifespan: 6 \u2013 25 Years (Depending on Species) Size: 1.3 \u2013 3.7 ft (0.4 \u2013 1.1 m) Weight: 2 \u2013 78 Pounds (1 \u2013 35 kg) Color: Black on their back, and white on their front. Some species have distinct markings or colors, such as yellow and orange. Diet: Seafood, such as fish, krill, squid Predators: Seals, Sea Lion, Killer Whales. Top Speed: 6 \u2013 9 kph (4 \u2013 6 mph) No. of Species:\n17 \u2013 20 Conservation Status:\n5 Species Endangered: Northern Rockhopper, Erect-crested, Yellow-eyed, African, Galapagos. 5 Species Vulnerable: Humboldt, Macaroni, S. Rockhopper, Fiordland, Snares. 3 Species Near-Threatened: Emperor, Magellanic, Royal.\nThey range from the Little Blue (or Fairy) Penguin (Eudyptula minor) which stands just 40-centimetres tall to the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) which averages just over 1-metre tall.\nDepending on the species, Penguins can weight from as little as 1-kilogram up to 40-kilograms and can live to 20 years. These meat eaters are usually found in coastal waters as well as areas that that are covered in ice.\nOne misconception about Penguins is that they are all cold weather creatures. They are native to the southern hemisphere and are found not just in the Antarctic. Many species inhabit warmer climates with one in particular \u2013 the Galapagos Penguin \u2013 that calls the region near the Equator home.\nInteresting Penguin Facts\n1. Penguins can\u2019t fly, but they sure can swim.\nThe wings of the Penguin have actually become flippers. This means they are somewhat clumsy on land, but can really move underwater. In fact, they are so agile ducking and weaving about that their actions in water look much like a bird in flight in air.\n2. Penguins are speedy underwater and are deep sea divers.\nWhen a Penguin dives into the water it can reach a speed of up to 12-kilometres per hour and when in high gear, some can reach up to 27 km/h. As for diving, the larger penguins can go deeper, with Emperor Penguins capable of diving down to depths of 565-metres \u2013 with dives lasting up to 22-minutes.\n3. The average Penguin spends as much time on land as it does in the water.\nActually, they will spend half of their life in one or the other.\n4. Penguins have devised ways to travel on land that would otherwise be hampered by their overall body shape and length of their legs.\nThey slide across snow on their bellies in a move known as tobogganing. When upright, Penguins waddle on foot or jump with both feet together in order to navigate terrain.\n5. Although the actual number is not clearly known, there are many Penguin species.\nThe common belief is that there are between 17 and 20 different Penguin species on the planet.\n6. Penguins use a layer of air for various benefits.\nWhen underwater, the layer of air that is trapped in the smooth plumage of the bird provides buoyancy. The air layer also acts as an insulator when in cold water.\n7. The diet of the Penguin is met with underwater diving.\nIt may look like they are playing, but since the Penguin feeds on sea life while swimming, it spends a lot of time in the water. One species, the Gentoo Penguin, can make up to 450 dives in a day when foraging for food.\n8. Penguins have special underwater vision.\nThe eyes of the Penguin have special adaptations which provide superior underwater vision. It assists in finding food and spotting predators.\n9. Penguins are highly social.\nBecause they tend to live in large colonies, Penguins have constant opportunities for social interaction and as a result have a number of vocal and visual signals that they have developed in order to communicate with one another.\n10. They have large extended families.\nPenguins also breed in large colonies. The Gentoo Penguin colonies can number just 100 pairs where other species have colonies in the size of several hundreds of thousands.\n11. Penguins know the value of working together.\nIn harsh environments, Penguins will huddle together to stay warm and conserve energy. Once a bird in the centre has warmed up, it moves to the perimeter and this continues so that each Penguin gets a turn in the centre of the huddle.\n12. Monogamy is common in the Penguin world.\nPairs will stick together during the breeding season. Often they will re-couple afterwards, or it depends. Sometimes a couple just goes their separate ways after the young have hatched and grow old enough to take care of themselves.\n13. Homosexuality is part of the Penguin culture.\nPenguins have the distinction of having the most widely publicized homosexual relationships of the entire animal kingdom.\n14. Penguins have small families.\nA typical clutch is two eggs however, the King and Emperor \u2013 the largest of the Penguin species \u2013 only have a single egg in a clutch. When measured proportionately to the adult Penguin body weight, these birds have the smallest eggs of any bird species on the planet.\n15. Roughly 99.999% of the Penguin species will share the incubation duties.\nIt\u2019s true, males take on as much of the work as females in the care of the eggs of their young. Well, that is with one exception. The male Emperor Penguin does not participate in this process.\n16. It\u2019s a good thing that most of the male Penguins pitch in with incubation shifts.\nWhen one part of the Penguin couple ventures off to sea in order to feed, the incubating egg is left with the other partner. Sometimes the shift can go days and even months simply because the ice pack can form leaving open ocean as much as 80-kilometres away from the colony.\n17. Penguins have incredible hearing.\nIt is with their sensitive hearing that parents and chicks are able to locate each other in a crowded colony.\n18. Penguins have a built-in camouflage.\nThe counter shading of the Penguin plumage \u2013 black backs with white fronts \u2013 protect these birds from most prey that cannot distinguish a swimming Penguin from sun shimmering on the water surface when viewed from deep in the water below. The dark plumage on their backs helps to \u2018hide\u2019 them from above.\n19. They have no land predators.\nPenguins are safe in colonies on land as they have no predators except those living in the water. This is very likely why Penguins have little or no fear of humans. Humans have taken advantage of this and have been able to conduct many studies on these interesting birds without much problem.\n20. The size of the Penguin can tell you where they are from.\nThe larger Penguin species inhabit the colder climates. This obviously means that the smaller Penguin species would live in the warmer climates of the world.\nPenguin Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Sphenisciformes Family: Spheniscidae\nGenus & Species List"}

They often work together to prey upon antelopes, zebras, wildbeest, and other large animals of the open grasslands. Many of these animals are faster than lions, so teamwork pays off.\nAfter the hunt, the group effort often degenerates to squabbling over the sharing of the kill, with cubs at the bottom of the pecking order.

It belongs to the subfamily Bovinae, the members of which are known as bovids.\nThere are several subspecies of African buffalo. Each varies slightly in appearance and is found in a different region of Africa. The largest and best-known subspecies is the Cape buffalo, which is found in Southern Africa.\nBoth male and female African buffaloes have distinctive upward-curving horns, the tips of which can be over 1 m (3.3 ft.) apart in large males. The horns of full-grown adult males meet in the middle, creating a hard panel known as a \u2018boss\u2019.\nThe horns are used as a means of defense against predators. Males also use their horns when fighting for dominance in the herd.\nAn adult African buffalo is large, powerful and well-armed; it has little to fear from most predators; only a very brave or hungry lion would attack a full-grown buffalo.\nThese large animals are known for their unpredictable behavior and will occasionally attack humans.\nYou can find out more about the African buffalo here: African Buffalo Facts\nReturn to index\nAfrican Bush Elephant\nScientific Name: Loxodonta africana\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe African bush elephant is the largest land animal in the world. It stands up to 4 m (13.1 ft.) in height, and weighs up to 6,048 kg (13,334 lb.). Both male and female African bush elephants have tusks (only male Asian elephants have tusks).\nUntil recently, all elephants in Africa were considered to be the same species, the African elephant. Recent studies have shown that Africa\u2019s elephant population consists of two different species: the African bush elephant and the smaller African forest elephant.\nThe African bush elephant is herbivorous, eating a wide variety of plant matter. The species is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, but its population is becoming increasingly fragmented.\nYou can find out more about the African bush elephant here: African Bush Elephant Facts.\nReturn to index\nAntelope\nNumber of species: 91\nFamily: Bovidae\nAntelopes are a group of hooved mammals within the family Bovidae (the family also includes animals such as bison, buffaloes, sheep, goats and cattle).\nAll antelopes have horns (although in some species they are only present on males), and most live in herds. Living in herds helps to keep antelopes safe from predators. With all those eyes and ears looking and listening out for danger, predators find it hard to approach undetected.\nThere are 91 species of antelope, most of which are native to Africa. They live in a range of habitats, including forests and grasslands. Antelopes are herbivores (plant eaters), and many species live in large herds.\nThe largest antelope is the giant eland, a species found in the savannas of Central Africa. The smallest is the royal antelope, which is found in Western Africa. It is just 25 cm (9.8 in.) tall at the shoulder.\nReturn to index\nBaboon\nNumber of species: 5\nGenus: Papio\nBaboons are monkeys in the genus (a group of related animals) Papio. They have long snouts and close-set eyes, giving their faces a dog-like appearance.\nThere are five species of baboon: the hamadryas baboon, Guinea baboon, olive baboon, yellow baboon, and chacma baboon. All five species are found in Africa.\nBaboons live in groups called troops. Troops range in size from 5 to 250 individuals. Male baboons use noises and visual threats, such as the baring of their long, sharp canine teeth, to establish dominance within the troop.\nThe conservation status of four of the five species of baboon is \u2018Least Concern\u2019.

This large snake is mainly arboreal (tree-dwelling).\nGreatly feared by local people, the boomslang is capable of delivering a bite that is potentially fatal if not treated.\nLike other members of the family Colubridae, to which it belongs, the boomslang\u2019s venom-delivering fangs are located at the back of its mouth. Snakes such as these are said to be \u2018rear-fanged\u2019.\nReturn to index\nBushbaby\nNumber of species: 18\nFamily: Galagidae\nBushbabies are nocturnal primates in the family Galagidae. Their huge eyes provide them with excellent night vision.\nThese small, monkey-like animals are expert jumpers. While leaping through dense vegetation, bushbabies fold their bat-like ears back for protection.\nBushbabies are also known as Galagos or Nagapies (which means \u2018little night monkeys\u2019 in Afrikaans, a language spoken in South Africa). Their English name is thought to come either from their baby-like appearance, or from the wails they make at night.\nReturn to index\nCheetah\nScientific Name: Acinonyx jubatus\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe cheetah is the world\u2019s fastest land animal. It uses its great speed to capture its prey, which consists of other fast-moving animals such as antelope and hares.\nThe cheetah\u2019s coat is pale brown / yellow and covered with distinctive black spots. The spots provide camouflage, breaking up the animal\u2019s outline against grasses and other foliage.\nThe cheetah is a member of the Felidae (cat) family. Although one of the larger cats, it is not considered to be a \u2018big cat\u2019 as it is neither a member of the subfamily Pantherinae, nor a member of the genus Panthera.\nThe cheetah\u2019s closest relatives are the cougar and the jaguarundi.\nClick here to learn more awesome cheetah facts.\nReturn to index\nCrocodile\nNumber of crocodile species found in Africa: 4\nNumber of crocodile species worldwide: 15\nSubfamily: Crocodylinae\nCrocodiles are semi-aquatic, meat-eating reptiles in the subfamily Crocodylinae.\nThese master ambush predators lie in wait in shallow water for their prey to approach. When the unsuspecting victim gets within range, the crocodile launches an explosive attack, capturing the prey in its immensely strong jaws.\nThere are four species of crocodile found in Africa: the slender-snouted crocodile, Nile crocodile, West African crocodile, and the dwarf crocodile.\nThe largest African crocodile is the Nile crocodile. It is the second-largest crocodile species: only Australia\u2019s saltwater crocodile is bigger!

Like all locusts it is a member of the grasshopper family Acrididae.\nMost of the time the desert locust is solitary and flies at night. However, under certain conditions \u2013 usually an increase in rainfall after a period of drought \u2013 the insects begin congregating and multiplying rapidly, forming huge swarms that fly during the day.\nDesert locust swarms can cover an area of 460 square miles (1,200 km2), and consist of up to 100 billion insects! These crop-destroying insect clouds can move at up to 124 miles (200 km) in a day.\nIt is said that a plague of locusts can affect the livelihood of one-tenth of all humans.\nReturn to index\nDriver Ant\nNumber of species: around 60\nGenus: Dorylus\nDriver ants live in huge colonies containing over 20 million insects. When food becomes short, driver ants march through the undergrowth in long lines consisting of many millions of insects, eating any insects (and occasionally larger animals) in their path.\nDriver ants have a sting, but usually attack with their powerful jaws. Their bite is extremely painful. Local people are known to use the insects\u2019 jaws, which remain closed even if the ant\u2019s head is separated from its body, to close wounds.\nReturn to index\nFennec Fox\nScientific Name: Vulpes zerda\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe fennec fox is the smallest member of the dog family. It is found in the Sahara Desert and other dry regions of Africa.\nThe large ears of the fennec fox are an adaptation for living in desert regions. They help the fox stay cool by transferring its body heat into the air.\nThe fennec fox has excellent hearing, and is even capable of hearing prey moving underground.\nYou can find out more about the fennec fox (and its adaptations for living in the desert) here: Fennec Fox Facts\nReturn to index\nGiraffe\nScientific Name: Giraffa camelopardalis\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe giraffe is one of the most distinctive of all African animals. With its long neck and stilt-like legs, the giraffe is the world\u2019s tallest land animal.\nThe giraffe\u2019s great height allows it to feed on leaves that are beyond the reach of other animals.\nThere is some disagreement over the number of giraffe species. Some authorities, such as the International Union for Nature Conservation (IUCN) recognize only one species. Others, such as the Catalogue of Life, recognize 4, and yet others recognize 8 species!\nOn the heads of both male and female giraffes are horn-like growths called ossicones.\nThe giraffe\u2019s closest living relative is the okapi, which you\u2019ll meet further down the page.\nYou can find out more about the tallest creature in the world here.\nReturn to index\nGorilla\nNumber of species: 2\nGenus: Gorilla\nBoth the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla are Critically Endangered\nGorillas are the world\u2019s largest primates.

It is a fitting name for this large animal, which has a semi-aquatic lifestyle.\nCommonly known as \u2018hippos\u2019, these herbivorous animals spend most of the day bathing in water or mud, only emerging at dusk when the temperature is cooler.\nA smaller hippo species, the pygmy hippo, lives in Africa\u2019s rainforests.\nThe hippos\u2019 closest relatives in the animal kingdom are the Cetaceans \u2013 the group of animals that includes whales and porpoises.\nYou can find out more about the hippopotamus here: Hippo Facts\nYou can find out more about the pygmy hippo here: Pygmy Hippopotamus Facts\nReturn to index\nHyena\nNumber of species: 4\nFamily: Hyaenidae\nThe family Hyaenidae contains four living species: the spotted hyena, brown hyena, striped hyena and the aardwolf.\nHyenas may look like dogs, but in fact are more closely related to cats. The animal group Carnivora (to which both dogs and cats belong) has two branches. One contains animals such as dogs, bears, and seals; the other contains animals such as cats, mongooses and hyenas.\nAlthough hyenas have a reputation for being scavengers it is only the striped hyena and the brown hyena that find most of their food this way. The spotted hyena (also known as the laughing hyena) actively hunts most of its own prey.\nThe aardwolf is the \u2018odd one out\u2019 among the hyenas. Instead of eating large vertebrates, it feeds on insects such as ants and termites.

One of the most common snakes in Africa, the species is present throughout the continent except in rainforests and desert regions. It is most common in savannas and grasslands.\nDue to its abundance, the puff adder is responsible for the most snake bite fatalities in Africa. Its venom is highly potent and the species is known to be aggressive. It is a nocturnal ambush hunter that waits for its victims to draw near before striking.\nReturn to index\nRhinoceros\nNumber of species: 5 (2 species found in Africa)\nFamily: Rhinocerotidae\nRhinoceroses, or rhinos, are among the world\u2019s largest land animals. The name rhinoceros comes from the Greek for \u2018nose horn\u2019.\nThere are five species of rhino, two of which live in Africa: the white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros.\nBoth African species have two horns on their noses. The species\u2019 prominent nose horns, and their large size ensure that they are among the best-known of all African animals.\nThe white rhinoceros is the largest of all the rhinos, with males (the larger of the two sexes) weighing around 2400 kg (5,000 lb.). The black rhino is by no means a small animal, with males reaching weights of around 1400 kg (3,090 lb.).\nDespite their names, both the white and black rhino are grey. The best way of telling them apart is by looking at their lips: the white rhino has square lips; the lips of the black rhino are beak-shaped.\nRhinos are herbivores. Their diet consists mainly of grass.\nThe conservation status of the white rhinoceros is Near Threatened.\nThe black rhinoceros is Critically Endangered, with a wild population of around 5,000.\nThe biggest threat to both species is poaching.

That\u2019s the same group in which the horse and the donkey are found. (The group also includes two lesser-known species: the African wild ass and the kiang, an ass found in Asia.)\nMany theories have been put forward to explain the purpose of the zebra\u2019s stripes. Possible explanations include: camouflage, heat dispersal, creation of an optical illusion to fool predators, and to make the zebra less attractive to biting flies (experiments in which horses were painted with stripes back up this last theory).\nThe plains zebra is the most common and widespread zebra. It is found in several parts of south-central and southern Africa. The conservation status of the species is Near Threatened due to over-hunting and the fencing off of traditional grazing routes.\nThe mountain zebra is found in hot, rocky, mountainous or hilly regions of south west Africa. There are no stripes on the undersides of this species. The mountain zebra\u2019s IUCN conservation status is Vulnerable.\nGr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra is not just the largest species of zebra, it\u2019s also the world\u2019s largest wild horse.

The monkey's coat ranges from golden yellow to red-orange. The color comes from carotenoids\u2014pigments in the animal's food\u2014and the reaction between sunlight and hair. The hair is longer around the monkey's hairless face, resembling a lion's mane.\nThe golden lion tamarin is the largest of callitrichine family, but it's still a small monkey. An average adult is about 26 centimeters (10 inches) long and weighs about 620 grams (1.4 pounds). Males and females are the same size. Tamarins have long tails and fingers, and like other New World monkeys, the golden lion tamarin has claws rather than flat nails.\nNew World monkeys, like the tamarin, use elongated fingers with claws to catch and eat prey. Steve Clancy Photography / Getty Images\nHabitat and Distribution\nThe golden lion tamarin has a tiny distribution range, restricted to 2 to 5 percent of its original habitat. It lives in three small areas of coastal rainforest in southeastern Brazil: Po\u00e7o das Antas Biological Reserve, Fazenda Uni\u00e3o Biological Reserve, and tracts of land set aside for the Reintroduction Program.\nGolden lion tamarin range. Oona R\u00e4is\u00e4nen & IUCN\nDiet\nTamarins are omnivores that eat fruit, flowers, eggs, insects, and other small animals. The golden lion tamarin uses its elongated fingers and toes to catch and extract its prey. Early in the day, the monkey feeds on fruit. In the afternoon, it hunts for insects and vertebrates.\nThe golden lion tamarin has a mutualistic relationship with nearly a hundred plants in the forest. The plants offer the tamarins food, and in return, the tamarins disperse seeds, helping regenerate the forest and maintaining genetic variability in the plants.\nNocturnal predators hunt the tamarins when they are sleeping. Significant predators include snakes, owls, rats, and wild cats.\nBehavior\nGolden lion tamarins live in trees. During the day, they use their fingers, toes, and tails to travel from branch to branch in order to forage. At night, they sleep in tree hollows or dense vines. Each night, the monkeys use a different sleeping nest.\nTamarins communicate using a variety of vocalizations. Reproductive males and females communicate using scent to mark territory and suppress reproduction of other troop members. When the dominant female dies, her mate leaves the group, and her daughter becomes the breeding female. Displaced males can enter a new group when another male leaves or by aggressively displacing one.\nTamarin groups are highly territorial, defending themselves against other golden lion tamarins in their range. However, the practice of changing sleeping sites tends to prevent overlapping groups from interacting.\nReproduction and Offspring\nGolden lion tamarins live together in groups of 2 to 8 members. A tamarin group is called a troop. Each troop has one breeding pair that mates during the rainy season\u2014usually between September and March.\nGestation lasts four and a half months. The female usually gives birth to twins, but can have anywhere from 1 to 4 infants. Golden lion tamarins are born with fur and with their eyes open. All members of the troop carry and care for the infants, while the mother only takes them for nursing. The babies are weaned at three months of age.\nFemales become sexually mature at 18 months, while males mature at 2 years of age. In the wild, most golden lion tamarins live about 8 years, but the monkeys live 15 years in captivity.\nConservation Status\nIn 1969, there were only about 150 golden lion tamarins worldwide. In 1984, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C. started a reintroduction program that involved 140 zoos around the world. However, threats to the species were so severe that the tamarin was listed as critically endangered in 1996, with a total of 400 individuals in the wild.\nToday, the golden lion tamarin is categorized as endangered on the IUCN Red List, but its population is stable. An assessment in 2008 estimated there were 1,000 mature adults and 3,200 individuals of all ages in the wild.\nDespite the success of the captive breeding and release program, the golden lion tamarins continue to face threats. The most significant is habitat loss and degradation from residential and commercial development, logging, farming, and ranching. Predators and poachers have learned to identify monkey sleeping sites, affecting the wild population. Golden lion tamarins also suffer from new diseases when they are translocated and from inbreeding depression.\nSources\nDietz, J.M.; Peres, C.A.; Pinder L. \"Foraging ecology and use of space in wild golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia)\".

When people speak of the American bison and the American buffalo they refer to the same animal.\nThere is a European bison as well, that, although separated by oceans, looks very much like the American bison or buffalo, and is basically considered to be the same animal.\nThe Old World \"buffaloes\" are the Cape buffalo of Africa, and the domesticated water buffalo of Asia. The most obvious difference is that they lack the thick, woolly fur of the American buffalo, and are usually black in color.\nThe horn shape is different as well, with the Old World buffaloes having longer horns that curve back in towards each other.\nFinally, all of these animals are bovines from the subfamily bovinae, which are all basically cow-like animals with cloven hooves and multi-chambered stomachs.\nThe American buffalo once numbered over 65 million strong across almost the entire continent of North America. By the end of the 1800's their numbers were reduced to a few hundred.\nNow, with organized conservation efforts, the number of wild bison roaming the open range is about 16,000, and there are close to 500,000 individuals living in large, privately owned herds.\nnative americans and the american buffalo\nThe American bison or American buffalo once roamed the continent of North America in such mass, that a galloping herd would leave a black swathe of trodden soil in its wake.\nNative people, particularly the Dakota, Lakota and Nakota Sioux, were indebted to the buffalo for their very lifestyle. These tribes followed the buffalo and planned each year around the migrating herds.\nThey hunted buffalo in several fascinating ways.\nBefore they had horses, they would drape themselves in wolf hides and crawl close enough to use a bow and arrow. This technique worked only with herds of \"bachelor\" males who did not fear wolves. The Indians found they could approach within yards of the herd when wearing wolf skins which hid their scent, where the buffalo would flee if they caught the scent of the Indians approaching. Herds with females and youngsters were wary of wolves and could not be hunted with this technique.\nIndians in the Dakotas employed a very dramatic hunting style, which involved stampeding a buffalo herd over a cliff. This was called a \"buffalo jump\" and there is a particular site in South Dakota where thousands of buffalo bones and hundreds of Indian arrowheads can be found at the foot of a steep cliff.\nThe native Americans had great respect for the buffalo, and some believed in a deity with the head of a buffalo called Tatanka. The word was also used as the word for buffalo in many Sioux native American societies.\nIn the mid 1800's the United States Government attempted to wipe out the buffalo, not because they wanted to be rid of buffalo, but because they wanted to wipe out the Indians.\nBecause of the plains Indians dependency on the buffalo for their survival, the animals were hunted down by the U.S. Cavalry in numbers so great that the army could not use all the meat and hides.\nThey literally burned thousands of carcasses after slaughtering them, so that they could not be utilized.\nIn the Indian culture, almost every part of the precious animal was harvested and put to use. Hides for clothing and tepees, bones for tools, each edible part used for different recipes and tonics. The tongues, eyes, horns and hooves all put to use.\nFor the Native American, the sight of their precious buffalo slaughtered and burned, must have been simply horrible..\nKinder hearts prevailed in the last years of that century, and the preservation of the species can literally be traced to several small groups of individuals moved to areas of the country where they would be protected. - Buffalo Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The herd is led by a wise matriarch who chooses grazing areas and napping sites and schedules throughout most of the year.\nWithin the herd are females and their youngsters, the females having a well-defined hierarchy which is helpful for cooperation and keeping the peace.\nMales live in smaller groups called \"bachelor herds\" and occasionally will move about in solitary until the mating season. In July, females begin to come into season and the males will start their attempts to attract willing females.\nDominant males will bellow, charge and head- but other males to keep them away from their females. These battles are not generally serious and the less aggressive or smaller male will simply find another female to tend or wait till later in the season.\nMating season will last until September, and then the males will recede back into their own herds. Males have nothing to do with the rearing of calves.\nThe calves are born a much lighter color than the adults. They have thick wool, and small tabs on their heads called \"buttons\" where their horns will soon start to grow. The females raise their calves in their maternal herd where the excitable youngsters frolic together in little \"kindergartens\" that are watched over by all the mothers.\nWhen calves are young, they may fall prey to bears or mountain lions, but wolf packs pose the greatest danger.\nWolf packs are particularly skilled at hunting buffalo, and use their classic \"tag-team\" hunting approach to run the herd until the weakest fall behind.\nThe gift of speed and the ability to run is critical to the survival of the young buffalo, and newborns are up and running with the herd within 20 minutes of birth.\nwhy aren't there domestic buffalo?\nThe buffalo is basically a very large cow - a ruminant which has a four-part stomach for breaking down food that would be undigestable by many other creatures.\nIt spends long hours chewing and re-chewing the grass of the plains. With their short necks they only can bend their head down and eat comfortably to a height of about six inches, and by leaving that amount of grass, the plant survives and regenerates.\nBuffalo usually drink by walking into the stream or river till they can comfortably reach the water.\nTheir incredibly plush fur sloughs off in the summertime in sheets, in a process, called \"moulting\", which leaves mounds of discarded hair throughout the valley.\nAttempts to domesticate the buffalo have failed miserably, and often resulted in injuries, because along with its immense size, the buffalo has a wild heart and has been described by those who tried, as being an animal that simply can't be tamed.\nEven buffalo cows raised in captivity refuse to be milked.\nhuge bison\na few more buffalo facts\nThe American bison and the American buffalo are the same animal\nThe name \"bison\" is more commonly accepted and is the name of the animals zoological genus and zoological species\nThere were once an estimated 65 million buffalo roaming free in North America\nThe buffalo is the largest land animal in the New World\nNovember 2nd is National Bison Day!\nin the 1800's the buffalo was almost hunted to extinction by the U.S. Government in an attempt to starve out the Native Americans\nBoth male and female buffalo have horns\nThe European bison lives in Poland and looks almost exactly like the American bison - Buffalo Facts!\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Bovidae\nSubfamily Bovinae\nGenus Bison\nSpecies bison\nBuffalo Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD herd North America plains,\nsome forest grass ENEMIES ENDANGERED TOP SPEED GENDER DIFFERENCE wolves threatened 37 mph both have horns AVG.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Liger Facts - Big Cat Rescue", "url": "https://bigcatrescue.org/liger-facts/", "text": "Hear this page:\nWhere do Ligers Come From?\nIrresponsible breeders is the short answer.\nA liger is the result of breeding a male lion to a tigress. A tigon is the result of breeding a male tiger to a lioness. Since lions and tigers do not exist in the same areas, this is not something that happens in the wild. It is done in captivity by disreputable carnies to produce a freak that ignorant people will pay to see. These cats suffer from many birth defects and usually die young. Because ligers are usually larger than either parent, it also puts the tigress at great risk in carrying the young and may require C-section deliveries or kill her in the process. When the public quits paying to see these unfortunate creatures, the evil people responsible for breeding them will stop this inhumane practice.\nYou can stop the abuse. Don\u2019t support places, like T.I.G.E.R.S. and Jungle Island, that breed ligers. Bhagavan Antle who calls himself Doc Antle, the person you will most often see promoting this shameful practice, has gone to great lengths to stop us and the brave young girl who created the video at the bottom of the page, from letting you know the truth. Visit her YouTube site HERE and let her know you appreciate what she is doing to prevent the future breeding of ligers and tigons.\nWhen you see ligers in the news or on TV, write the station and let the reporters know the truth about hybrids. You can send 5 letters at once to the media of your choice through our online email system at CatLaws.com\nActually they aren\u2019t this dramatic. See real photos of ligers below.\nFind out more about Big Cat Rescue\u2019s liger and tiger rescue.\nRead about the conviction of those involved in canned hunts in the US. They excuse their behavior by making the case that ligers and tigons are not protected by the Endangered Species Act. Now you know why so many of these sleazy back yard breeders are trying to produce more of them.\nLIGERS and TIGONS\nVideo by a Big Cat AdvoCat. Visit her site: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKYILLEdy5s\nThe following story attempts to make it sound like there could be some reason to breed lions and tigers for public amusement, but anyone who cares about animals knows that this is a despicable thing to do because the cats have to spend their lives in deprivation and confinement and are genetically so unhealthy that they usually die young. The ONLY reason anyone breeds ligers is to create a freak that simple minded people will pay to see.\nLigers Make a \u201cDynamite\u201d Leap Into the Limelight\nby: Maryann Mott August 5, 2005\nIt\u2019s half lion, half tiger, and completely real. Now thanks to a cameo in the 2004 cult movie Napoleon Dynamite, the liger has leaped into the limelight, prompting fans to ask, What are they really like?\nThe faintly striped, shaggy-maned creatures are the offspring of male lions and female tigers, which gives them the ability to both roar like lions and chuff like tigers-a supposedly affectionate sound that falls somewhere between a purr and a raspberry.\nWeighing in at about a thousand pounds (450 kilograms) each, they typically devour 50 pounds (23 kilograms) of raw meat in a meal.\n\u201cFor the most part they\u2019re really laid back,\u201d said Jason Hutcherson, vice president of Wild Animal Safari in Pine Mountain , Georgia . \u201cThey like to swim and play in the water.\u201d\nThe drive-through wildlife park is believed to have the country\u2019s largest concentration of ligers, housing ten of the massive cats.\nSince 1999 the park has bred its male lion and female tiger many times, producing about 24 cubs.\nNot all of them have been healthy, though.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had 3 out of 24 that, for all practical purposes, were normal but developed as they grew older some kind of neurological disorder,\u201d Hutcherson said.\nAutopsies didn\u2019t reveal what caused the cubs to develop \u201chead shakes,\u201d so park staff \u201cchalked it up to a genetic defect,\u201d Hutcherson said.\nAccredited zoos frown on the practice of mixing two different species and have never bred ligers, says Jane Ballentine, a spokesperson for the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, based in Silver Spring , Maryland.\n\u201cKeeping the two species separate has always been standard procedure,\u201d she said.\nWild Ligers?\nLong before fans heard Napoleon claim that the liger is \u201cpretty much my favorite animal,\u201d there have been rumors of the hybrid\u2019s existence in the wild.\nLion-tiger mating occurs in captivity. But it does not happen in the wild, probably for the same reason humans do not breed with gorillas or chimps.\n\u201cCrossing the species line\u201d does not generally occur in the wild, because \u201cit would result in diminished fitness of the offspring,\u201d said Ronald Tilson, director of conservation at the Minnesota Zoo in Apple Valley.\nGeography is another obstacle to natural lion-tiger mating. Wild tigers mainly inhabit Asia, whereas the lion\u2019s current natural habitat is almost entirely in Africa.\nThe Gir National Forest in India is the only place in the world where tiger and lion ranges overlap, fueling speculation that wild ligers roamed the area hundreds of years ago.\nTilson doesn\u2019t believe it.\n\u201cThis would be highly improbable, because the Gir forest is really very dry and not optimal tiger habitat,\u201d he said.\nA Liger Named Patrick\nPerched on the edge of the Mojave Desert near Los Angeles , California , a lone liger, named Patrick, lives at Shambala Preserve, which bills itself as \u201ca haven for endangered exotic big cats.\u201d\n\u201cThe interesting thing about these animals is that they have the best qualities of the tiger and the best of the lion,\u201d said movie actress and conservationist Tippi Hedren, who has run Shambala since 1972. \u201cThose qualities manifest themselves in the fact that they like to be in the water [a tiger trait] and are very social [a lion trait].\u201d\nMany of the cats at the 80-acre (32-hectare) sanctuary are orphans or castoffs from circuses, zoos, and private owners who could no longer care for the animals.\nPatrick arrived at the sanctuary seven years ago after federal authorities shutdown the roadside zoo in Illinois where he lived.\nThe 800-pound (360-kilogram) liger was kept in such a small cage that his hind-leg muscles had started to atrophy, said Hedren, who starred in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds.\nPatrick\u2019s compound at Shambala allows him plenty of room for exercise. A stream runs through his compound, so his tiger half can play in the water or his lion half can stay out of it, whichever he chooses.\nLiger in the Hills\nSpirit of the Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in Spearfish, South Dakota , recently acquired a liger named Samson and 48 other big cats after federal authorities closed a Minnesota wildlife facility.\n\u201cEveryone who comes wants to see Samson,\u201d said Trevor Smith, an environmental biologist and sanctuary board member.\nThe four-and-a-half-year-old hybrid tips the scales at over a thousand pounds (over 450 kilograms), and eats 30 to 50 pounds (14 to 23 kilograms) of raw meat every other day.\n\u201cSamson is really picky. He\u2019ll only eat beef, elk, and venison,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe try and feed him chicken, like the other animals, but he won\u2019t touch it. He\u2019ll let it rot in the sun.\u201d\nThe sanctuary-whose mission is to educate people about wild animals and emphasize that they don\u2019t make good pets-has seen a surge in visitors since Samson\u2019s arrival in June.\nMuch of the public\u2019s curiosity about the liger stems from Napoleon Dynamite, Smith said.\nSmith worries that Samson is \u201cbecoming too much of a freak show.\u201d\nIf Samson had his way, Smith said, he\u2019d sleep away the day inside, away from public view.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge ethical debate at the sanctuary on whether or not we should lock him out of his shed,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut at the same time, he\u2019s why the visitors are coming.\u201d\nTigons and Ti-tigons\nA tigon is the product of a male tiger and female lion. They receive growth inhibitor genes from both parents and so are smaller than either of them. They show much the same coloration of ligers except they sometimes have more distinct stripes. As with ligers the females are fertile whereas the males are sterile. They have the same vocalizations as liger, a sort of cross between lion and tiger. Ti-tigons speak tiger. Tigons are now rarer than ligers, but in the late 1800\u2019s/early 1900\u2019s tigons were more common.\nMeet our past liger friend Freckles\nThis lion and tiger had been raised together for the bad purpose of creating ligers. The female was spayed and the male got a vasectomy upon arrival to Big Cat Rescue to ensure there would be no \u201caccidents.\u201d\nLigers in the News\nLiger\nliger\nView \u201cLiger\u201d on Spundge\nBig Cat Rescue does not condone the breeding of ligers. These news stories are posted so that you can help us educate people as to why it is cruel to breed ligers and tigons."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Cape Buffalo Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Cape-buffalo-facts.html", "text": "cape buffalo Facts\nPortrait of a Cape Buffalo\nThe most awesome of all cape buffalo facts is that they are so dangerous they are referred to as \"the Black Death\"! Highly prized by big game hunters, these incredible creatures are members of \"Africa's Big Five\" - the five most difficult African animals to hunt on foot.\nThe African lion, the leopard, the African elephant and the rhinoceros (either white or black), are the other four members, but the cape buffalo actually kills more big game hunters than the other four animals combined.\nThere are 4 subspecies of African buffalo, which is Africa's only cow-like animal. The largest of these is the Cape buffalo, which is the only subspecies recognized as a \"Big Five\" member. In other words, just like all Pit Bulls are dogs but not all dogs are Pit Bulls, all Cape buffalo are African buffalo, but not all African buffalo are Cape buffalo.\nIt is also incorrectly referred to as the water buffalo, which is a significantly different animal found in Asia. Water buffalo are taller than cape buffalo, but are actually domesticated animals, with mild personalities compared to their hot tempered cousin.\nThe cape buffalo is a herbivorous bovine, effectively a plant-eating cow, but they are extremely aggressive and downright vengeful. Displaying perhaps a little more smarts than a typical bovine, there are numerous accounts of them using their legendary memories and extreme persistence to enact revenge upon hunters who shoot at or injure them. Cape buffalo have stalked hunting parties, hiding in wait, and ambushing their attackers.\nThey reportedly charge thousands of people a year, and gore over 200. They can attack and cause serious injury with the tips of their huge, curved horns, or by head butting with their \"boss\" which is the solid shield of horn that covers the skull where the horns emerge.\nBoth males and females have horns, but the males horns grow larger and can measure close to 4 feet across. Males also develop a thicker neck, a larger hump over the shoulders, and a fringe of long hairs around the throat that looks a bit like a beard, but is called a \"dewlap\". The largest males approach 2,000 pounds and 6 feet at the shoulder and take nearly 10 years of growing to reach full size.\nFull grown individuals are rarely targeted by large predators, but weakened adults and calves are hunted by lions. Even for a large pride of lions however, attacking any member of a Cape buffalo herd is extremely perilous. Herd members will come rushing to eachothers aid, and many a full grown lion has been gored to death by the Cape buffalo's incredible horns.\ncape buffalo lifestyle\nCape buffalo are extremely gregarious herd animals that will gather in groups of thousands when grazing is good. In the dry season they break up into smaller groups of 30 to 200 or so to find food. Within these herds are several smaller sub-herds that stick together and travel together.\nCows and their offspring, including young bulls up to 3 years old, will form family type units of 10 to 30, generally lead by a few matriarchal females. Groups of young bachelors stay together, and mature bulls may stay in small groups of 4 or 5 grizzled veterans sometimes called \"gangs\". Bulls passed their prime are called \ufeff\"dagga boys\", and will stay on the perimeter of the herd. The movements of these herds is driven generally in the same direction, following food sources and green pastures as they emerge.\nCape buffalo cannot go long without drinking, and are rarely more than 10 miles from a water source. They travel close to rivers and waterways, and will joyfully wallow in mud if available. They cover themselves and roll around in muddy pools to keep cool in hotter months. The mud can prevent insect bites and may smother some insects as well.\nCape buffalo, although notorious for their aggression, particularly towards hunters, are highly social. They engage in mutual grooming, will rest or lie down in close proximity, resting their chins on eachothers backs and shoulders, and engage in affectionate nuzzling and playful ear chewing.\nThey are extraordinarily protective of eachother, and weak, injured or older herd members have been observed enjoying the support of the herd. When in unfamiliar territory or under attack, herds will often surround calves or weak members all facing outward in a circle, ready to fight all comers.\nThere have been numerous accounts over the years of buffalo coming to aid one of their own against a lion attack, mobbing lion prides with a community effort. A tendency to charge en masse Sometimes the buffalo are the aggressors, particularly if a solitary lion, hyena or wild dog wanders into the path of the herd. Older bulls and sometimes fearless matriarchs will chase and sometimes kill lone predators, and some even make sport of it.\ngorgeous Cape buffalo\ncape buffalo reproduction\nAfrican buffalo adults protecting calf\nDuring mating season mature bulls will drive off younger males and old bulls, while attempting to keep cows close. Males may engage in sparring, pushing eachother with their bosses, but goring is rare, and joists tend to be tests of strength, with the less robust party leaving the scene before any damage is done. Strong, healthy bulls in the 8 to 14 year range are most successful at attracting a herd of cows, and just a few males will actually breed with most of the females. Gradually, however, they lose their ability to defend their herd. Eventually, very old males will stop attempting to rejoin the herd and will stay on the outskirts in small groups, or sometimes alone. As cape buffalo age the hair on their rumps tends to bald, and older males can be identified by their bare behinds. With patches of bare skin exposed, mud wallowing is a requirement to prevent sunburn, and these older bulls spend lots of time by the mud holes. They are called \"dagga boys\" by the Zulu people, dagga being the Zulu word for mud. Dagga boys tend to be cantankerous, frustrated, and exceptionally dangerous, probably accounting for the majority of attacks on people. Cows are pregnant for about 340 days, and breeding is timed so that calving takes place at the beginning of the rainy season. The calf is born quite precocious, fully furred, eyes open and able to stand within minutes. Calves have no horns when newborn, but there are two horny circles on the head called \"buttons\" from which the horns will soon start to grow. It takes about 10 years for horns to reach full size, and for the boss to fully harden. Young calves are raised by their mother, but all members of the herd look out for them and may come to their aid. The herd will also form a circle around calves when danger is near. If a pride of lions or other threat approaches herd members will stand in a circle around the calves facing out, ready to defend the little ones.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

There are 2 species of oxpeckers, both very similar in appearance, one red-billed and the other yellow-billed.\nThey are both quite happy to roost on not just Cape buffalo, but also elephants, antelope, and especially rhinos. They feed on the insect parasites that infest their large hosts. Ticks, lice, flies, and fleas colonize on Cape buffalo and are eaten by these birds.\nThe oxpecker will remove embedded ticks from all areas of the hosts body, entering ears and nostrils, and excavating around delicate nether regions. This has always been thought of as a symbiotic relationship, with both creatures benefiting relatively equally, but recent observations suggest that the buffalo doesn't benefit nearly as much as the oxpecker.\nOnce thought to keep buffaloes wounds clean by removing dead tissue, it is now thought that the oxpeckers actually interfere with and delay proper healing.\nIt is also questionable how beneficial their control of ticks may be, since they tend to prefer blood-engorged ticks that have already fed off the buffalo, allowing the ticks that have just arrived to attach and settle in for a meal.\nBy doing this the birds are, in a way, actually consuming buffalo blood with each engorged tick they eat. So the pendulum is swinging towards the idea that oxpeckers, once thought to be little helpers, are actually just as parasitic as the parasites they feed on.\na few more cape buffalo facts\nCape buffalo are so powerful they have been know to tip over cars\nThe \"boss\" is the solid shield of horn that covers the top of the buffalo's head\nThe Cape buffalo is also called the African buffalo\nThere are 4 subspecies of Cape or African buffalo\nBaby Cape buffalo can run with the herd just an hour after being born\nNew born Cape buffalo have spots on their heads called \"buttons\" where the horns will grow\nCape buffalo have a top speed of 35 miles an hour\nCape buffalo are so dangerous they are known as \"the Black Death\"\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Bovidae\nGenus Syncerus\nSpecies caffer\nCape Buffalo - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD herd, gang Africa savanna grass TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG HEIGHT 35 mph no 1300 pounds 50-70 inches ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH WEIGHT BIRTHHEIGHT 1 x year 340 days 90-120 pounds 20-26 inches RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH STANDS mother 1 eyes open 1/2 hour WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 6 months 1 year 2 - 3 years 15-25 years"}

Flippers Two long, powerful, wing-like front flippers with short claws and two smaller rear flippers.\nUses front flippers for propulsion and back flippers to steer while swimming.\nRotates all four flippers underneath body to walk on land.\nFlippers are supported by a skeletal structure similar to the bones in a human hand.\nMay hold flippers out of the water to thermoregulate. Body/Fur/Whiskers Stiff, thick whiskers, or \u201cvibrissae,\u201d made of keratin found around the muzzle. Help to feel the shape and size of objects and detect vibrations and sounds.\nFemale coloration is lighter brown while male is typically darker brown, though males range in color from light brown to black. Fur on male\u2019s head may become lighter with age. Coat appears darker when wet.\nMale develops bony bump on head known as a sagittal crest at approximately five years of age.\nPup is dark brown in color at birth.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Monkey Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Monkey-facts.html", "text": "monkey Facts\nPortrait of a Howler Monkey\nMonkeys, gibbons and apes are all primates, but belong in different families. The most obvious difference between monkeys and apes is that apes do not have tails.\nA few isolated monkey species do not have tails either, but they are the exception rather than the rule.\nThe great apes, which are the human being, the orangutan, the gorilla, the chimpanzee and the bonobo, are much larger than monkeys and much more highly evolved.\nThe gibbon, which has many aspects of both monkeys and apes, is truly its own separate creature, although it is often lumped in with either apes or monkeys by virtue of many different arguments, both scientific and not so scientific.\nWe have separated the gibbons and offer their own article. We have also separated the baboon into it's own page because it is so well known, but the baboon is in fact an Old World monkey with the customary large size and non-prehensile tail..\nMonkeys are highly intelligent and active primates that are broken into two groups known as Old World monkeys and New World monkeys.\nThe Old World monkeys (including baboons) inhabit Africa and Asia, and are more closely related to apes. They are generally larger than New World monkeys, have more elongated faces, and have a tail that is not \"prehensile\".\nNew world monkeys are five families of primates that inhabit Central America, South America and some parts of Mexico. New world monkeys are generally smaller, have more flattened faces and have \"prehensile tails\" which they are capable of gripping with.\nThe prehensile tail is slim, muscular and very long, usually longer than the body length, and can easily support the weight of the entire monkey. These tails often have a patch of bare rough skin called a tactile pad or friction pad, that helps in grasping objects.\nWhile the tail is used primarily to assist in climbing and keeping the hands free for foraging and carrying, some monkey species will use it almost as an extra hand to hold and manipulate food items.\nNew world monkeys often use their tails to grab each other during wrestling and play, and will wrap their tails around each other for comfort.\nThe Old World baboons are the largest of the monkeys with males reaching almost 4 feet long and weighing nearly 80 pounds. The tiny pygmy marmosets of the New World rain forests are the smallest monkeys and can be as tiny as 4 inches and 4 ounces!\nof monkey hands and tails\nProboscis Monkeys - Old World\nSpider Monkey - New World\nOld World monkeys are most quickly differentiated from New World monkeys by looking at their tails.\nThe Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails that can not grip. The New World monkeys have long. slim prehensile tails that they may climb with and that they can carry and manipulate items with.\nThe most dexterous tail in the monkey kingdom belongs to the spider monkey. These monkeys can hold, carry and even catch items with their tails, and will gesture with them as well.\nThere is a small bare area of rough skin on the underside of the last vertebra in the tail. This \"tactile pad\" has many nerve endings like a fingertip, which aids in delicate tasks like peeling a banana.\nThe prehensile tail is surely a product of the New World monkeys densely forested environment. Most New World monkeys are largely arboreal, spending the majority of their time high in the forest canopy, and some never leave the trees at all.\nWhile many Old World monkeys like the baboons, spend most of their time on the ground walking around on all fours like a dog.\nAnother area of monkey anatomy that shows some variety is the hand. All of the great apes have opposable thumbs meaning that the thumb can be swiveled around so that the pad of the thumb faces the pads of the fingers and can be brought together in a \"pincer\" grip.\nLikewise, all of the Old World monkeys have opposable thumbs.\nBut many New World monkeys, including marmosets, spider monkeys and capuchins do not have opposable thumbs.\nThese animals thumbs range from completely unopposable where the thumb can not be rotated, as in the marmoset and the tamarin, pseudo-opposable where there is partial rotation of the thumb to the side of the hand, and a third situation, as in the spider monkey, where the thumb is actually a very small digit - only 15% the length of the other fingers, and has very little use at all.\nThe New World monkeys life high in the trees no doubt plays a part. Using all five digits together to encircle a branch with more of a cupping motion rather than grasping, seems more effective when speed and mobility are of the essence.\nWith a tail that is able to help as well as its hands, the spider monkey swings from limb to limb with incredible ease, and with a thumb that is always in harmony with the rest of the hand.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Bachelor males may live either in small groups, or completely alone. Proboscis are similar to lions in that when a new male displaces the dominant male, he may kill the existing infants.\nThis is not the typical monkey lifestyle however. Most monkeys live in social groups from 5 to 30 individuals, and separate into pairs for a few days while mating takes place.\nOften there is a change that signals both the males and females readiness to mate, including swelling of the genitals, and reddening of both the genitals and sometimes the face.\nFemales may mate with several males and usually give birth alone.\nSome species, like macaques and baboons, give birth on the ground, but many others make nests up in the trees.\nOne infant is standard, and the baby will be held close to the chest for a few hours to up to two weeks before they graduate to riding on the mothers back.\nInfant monkeys live exclusively on mothers milk for as many as three months, but even after starting solid food, they will continue to nurse for up to a year.\nIn some species, there is some mild cooperation within the group in the rearing of young, but the mother is mostly responsible, and most male monkeys do not treat their own offspring with any special interest.\nYoung monkeys are agile, active and incredibly curious. The most advanced monkey species have their own culture, including greatly varied \"accents\" to their vocalizations, even from troop to troop of the same species.\nLittle ones are taught social codes, local ways to gather and handle food, hunting techniques, seasonality of fruits and nuts, the safest places to sleep and eat.\nLike humans and apes, monkeys have been seen to demonstrate actions in order to teach young ones. In one such instance a mother macaque was observed repeatedly washing a piece of fruit until the toddler caught on and began dipping his own lunch in the river. - Amazing Monkey Facts\nmonkey face\nthe many faces of monkeys\nThere are over 260 known species of monkeys, all of whom display their own distinct look. Colors and patterns, Mohawks and mono-brows, variations in eye shape, skull, nostril, and ear structure, bare skin to fur ratios, and overall proportions produce a slide show of differences unrivaled by any other animal group. Forward facing eyes and color vision no doubt played a part in the development of so many wonderful mugs! - Monkey Facts.\nmarmosets and tamarins\nGolden lion tamarin, Emporer tamarin, pygmy marmoset, cotton-ear marmoset\nThe marmoset genus is made up of 22 species of New World monkeys including the worlds smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset. There are 16 species within the tamarin genus.\nMarmosets and tamarins differ in jaw shape and skull construction but otherwise have a very similar appearance and lifestyle. They are the smallest monkey species and differ from other monkey families in several ways.\nTheir teeth are specially designed to strip open the bark of trees exposing the sap inside. Some marmoset species may get up to 70% of their diet from tree sap. Otherwise they will eat insects, birds eggs, flowers and fruits.\nMarmosets and tamarins have more primitive brains than other monkeys, and they have claws on their hands and feet as opposed to the flat nails that other monkeys and apes have.\nThese beautiful little monkeys have an amazing variety of face and head decorations, from the flowing red locks of the Golden Lion tamarin, to the feather like extensions of the cotton eared marmoset, to the outrageous mustache of the emperor tamarin.\nThese monkeys almost always give birth to twins. Double adorable!\ndifferent monkey species\nGolden monkeys and black and white colobus monkeys\nThe tremendous variety of monkey species lead to differing lifestyles, habits and appearance.\nMany New World monkeys are largely arboreal and some, like the marmosets and Tamarins may spend their entire lives in trees, never touching the ground.\nThe largest of the Old World monkeys the baboons, have a completely different experience. Living similiar to a pack animal, moving in fairly large groups on the ground, walking usually on all fours.\nThey are still good climbers and will hunt small prey and gather fruits in the trees, but also scavenge around on the ground like dogs might, with their noses low to the ground.\nMany of the Old World monkeys are built for life on the ground, with stronger, wider and more developed lower bodies, while the New World spider monkeys have tiny hips and legs as thin as their arms.\nnight monkey\nMost Old World monkey species sit down fully on their buttocks much as humans do when resting and eating giving them a sort of \"little old man\" quality, while the New World monkeys rest on flexed haunches, more like a cat.\nWhile the majority of monkey species are diurnal - out and about by day- there is an entire family of New World monkeys known as \"night monkeys\" eleven nocturnal species who have large forward facing round eyes like an owl for night vision.\nEqually diverse are the temperatures and habitats monkeys may be found in. Many monkeys naturally live in hot - even sweltering- desert or rain forest environments, but there are some species that live in ice and snow like Japans amazing macaques.\nThese monkeys range farther North than any primate species living in the highlands of central Japan where the snowfall is extensive. Also known as snow monkeys, they are known for bathing in the hot springs there, grooming each other meticulously while soaking up to their necks .\na few more monkey facts\nA group of monkeys is called a \"troop\"\nSome Old World monkeys have cheek pouches that allow them to save food and chew it later.\nMany monkey species, like capuchins, use tools regularly.\nOnly one monkey species exists in Europe, the Barbary macaque of Gibraltar\nHowler monkeys can be heard for 5 miles\nSome New World monkeys may live their entire lives in rain forest treetops and never touch the ground.- Monkey Facts"}

Unlike African lions, the males do not tend to live with the females of their pride unless they\u2019re mating or have a large kill.\nAsian lions used to range from Turkey, across Asia, to eastern India, but the rise of firearms across the world meant that they were hunted to near-extinction for sport.\nThe male Asiatic lion has a relatively short, sparse and darker mane compared to the fuller mane of the African lion. As a result, the male Asiatic lion's ears tend to remain visible at all times.\nThe most distinguishing characteristic of the Asiatic lion is the longitudinal fold of skin that runs along its belly. This is absent in African lions.\nToday, the remaining wild lions are vulnerable to disease, disaster and potential poaching, and have to live alongside a growing human population that also needs the land for cattle and crops.\nConservation status\nThe Asian lion population has recovered from the brink of extinction to several hundred individuals. They occupy remnant forest habitats in the two hill systems of Gir and Girnar that comprise Gujarat\u2019s largest tracts of dry deciduous forest, thorny forest and savannah. Five protected areas currently exist to protect the Asian lion: Gir Sanctuary, Gir National Park and Pania Sanctuary to form the Gir Conservation Area (GCA) covering an area of 20,000 km2 of forest representing the core habitat for the Asiatic lion. The other two wildlife sanctuaries, Mitiyala and Girnar, protect satellite areas within dispersal distance of the Gir Conservation Area. An additional sanctuary is being established in the nearby Barda forest to serve as an alternative home for Gir lions.\nFactors which are threats to the Gir PA and lion conservation identified as encroachment, forest fire, natural calamities, grazing, collection of fuelwood, Non-timber forest produce (NTFP), poaching, tourism, religious pilgrimage and accidental lion deaths due to human causes. Currently the Gir landscape is witnessing an unprecedented change of traditional land-use patterns owing to agro-industrial developments and urban sprawl. Lions in the human dominated landscape are long ranging, even venturing inside villages at night for food. But they need specific day time habitat patches (refuge sites) so as to avoid conflicts. Such patches are characterized by mostly grasslands, Acacia patches, Prosopis juliflora patches and orchards. Since the land ownership of these crucial habitat patches are complex and largely private owned, they are likely to succumb fast to such development induced habitat alterations thereby threatening the metapopulation dynamics of the lions in future.\nWhat will ZSL do?"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Black Lion Tamarin - Facts, Diet, Habitat & Pictures on Animalia.bio", "url": "https://animalia.bio/black-lion-tamarin", "text": "The Black lion tamarins have a monogamous mating system, where one male mates with one female exclusively. However, populations in some areas exhibit polyandry. When a group contains more than one mature male, the female often mates with multiple males to hide paternity of her offspring. Breeding and births usually occur from spring to autumn. Meanwhile, populations in Brazil mate and breed between August and March. Duration of pregnancy is unknown, although females of other related lion tamarins usually undergo 125 - 132 days of gestation. Females can yield up to 3 - 4 young per litter, although twins are most common. The newborn babies live mainly with their mother until 2 - 3 weeks old, when the father begins to care for them. He will remain with his offspring during most of the day, carrying them to their mother every 2 - 3 hours to feed. Weaning occurs after 2 - 3 months old. However, young lion tamarins continue living with their natal group until 16 - 24 months old, when they are mature."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Sea Lion Facts, Worksheets, Taxonomy & Etymology For Kids", "url": "https://kidskonnect.com/animals/sea-lion/", "text": "Not ready to purchase a subscription? Click to download the free sample version Download sample\nKnown for being popular attractions at zoos, sea lions are marine mammals that have short, thick hair; a big belly; and long fore flippers. They can walk on all fours and have external ears. They can be found in shallow waters where there is an abundant food supply.\nSee the fact file below for more information on the sea lion or alternatively, you can download our 20-page Sea Lion worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\nKey Facts & Information\nTAXONOMY AND ETYMOLOGY\nSea lions are part of the Otariidae family, which also includes the fur seal. The Otariidae family has 6 living species of sea lions: Steller sea lion, Australian sea lion, South American sea lion, New Zealand sea lion, California sea lion, and the Galapagos sea lion. The Japanese sea lion species became extinct in the 1950s.\nSea lions also belong to the same scientific group as seals and walruses. This group is called Pinnipeds. This term means \u201cwing foot\u201d or \u201cfeather foot\u201d because of the flippers they have at the end of their limbs that help them swim in the water.\nPHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES\nMale sea lions can range from 2 to 3 meters in length and can weigh from 200 to 1,000 kilograms while females can reach 1.3 to 2.7 meters in length and 50 to 270 kilograms in weight.\nSea lions can turn their limbs forward, enabling them to walk on all fours. Their ears have flaps that they can turn downward so water does not enter their ears while swimming or diving.\nThe bodies of sea lions are covered with a thick layer of blubber or fat to keep them warm in the chilly sea water. Their body color differs depending on the type of species, but it generally ranges from light to very dark brown, and some even have reddish coverings.\nThey also have very sensitive whiskers that help them detect fish in the water, and their eyes have a reflective membrane that allows them to see in the dark underwater.\nBEHAVIOR\nSea lions are fit for the extremes of marine life. They rely on their excellent sense of smell, hearing, and touch to catch food in the water. When on land, their front flippers offer strong support for their bodies.\nWhen they dive, sea lions\u2019 nostrils automatically close up, allowing them to stay in the water for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. They can swim at a speed of 29 kilometers per hour, helping them escape from killer whales and sharks.\nSea lions are generally not violent animals. However, humans are advised to stay at least 15 meters from them in order to avoid violent or aggressive actions from the sea lions.\nOverwhelming human presence may cause sea lions to undergo stress, causing them to retreat and sometimes even abandon their locations completely.\nHABITAT AND DIET\nSea lions live along the coastlines and islands of the Pacific Ocean. Their range extends from subarctic to tropical waters, except for the Northern Atlantic Ocean.\nThe six different species of sea lions are found in different sea coasts around the globe, including California, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and the Galapagos Islands.\nSea lions are carnivorous, which means their diet consists mostly of meat. They eat fish, squid, crabs, and clams. The Steller sea lion species also eats seals.\nSea lions swallow their food whole, and they often toss the fish or squid up until it can slide down their mouth and into the stomach. When eating food with hard shells, they use their flat back teeth to crush the food before swallowing.\nREPRODUCTION\nSea lions begin their breeding period during the summer months from January to March. Despite being marine animals, sea lions still reproduce on land.\nMale sea lions or bulls leave the water during the spring to claim their territories on ice, rocks, or the shore. They eat large amounts of food, so they can live without eating while they guard their territory and the female sea lions.\nEach adult male sea lion gathers as many female sea lions or cows to his territory, which is called a harem. Each sea lion harem or family group can have up to 15 female sea lions.\nFemale sea lions give birth to only a single pup per year. These pups are born with their eyes open and with a long dense coat of hair called the lanugo. Mothers nurse their pups up to six months of age.\nCONSERVATION STATUS\nThree species of sea lions are already categorized as endangered by the The World Conservation Union: the Australian sea lion, the Galapagos sea lion, and the New Zealand sea lion.\nSome stranded sea lions get rescued, treated, and sheltered by zoological institutions. These sea lions have usually become stranded due to illness, injury, or abandonment.\nSea lion populations continue to decrease due to the drastic effects caused by humans on their ecosystems. One of the most effective methods for conserving sea lions is through minimizing human interaction with them.\nSea Lion Worksheets\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the sea lion across 20 in-depth pages. These are ready-to-use Sea Lion worksheets that are perfect for teaching students about the sea lions which are marine mammals that have short, thick hair; a big belly; and long fore flippers.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "15 Hippopotamus Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/hippopotamus/", "text": "Hippo Profile\nThe hippopotamus, or hippo, is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is a large, mostly herbivorous mammal.\nThe name hippopotamus comes from an ancient Greek word that translates to mean \u2018river horse\u2019 and the hippo is the third-largest land mammal following the elephant and rhinoceros.\nHippo Facts Overview\nHabitat: Rivers, lakes & mangrove swamps Location: sub-Saharan Africa, Colombia Lifespan: 40 \u2013 50 years Size: 13 \u2013 18 ft (4 to 5.5 m) Weight: 1,760 \u2013 3,530 pounds (800 \u2013 1,600 kg) Color: Grey, black, brownish purple Diet: Herbivore \u2013 Grass & fruit Predators: Crocodiles, lions & hyenas can prey on baby hippo. Adults, don\u2019t generally have predators. Top Speed: 40 Kph (30 mph) No. of Species:\n2 Conservation Status:\nVulnerable\nThe hippo can be found in lakes, rivers and mangrove swamps. Male hippos are known as \u2018bulls\u2018, female hippos are \u2018cows\u2018, and babies are \u2018calves\u2018.\nTerritorial males will control a pre-determined stretch of water, which will include a group of five to thirty females and their young. This group of hippos is actually known as a \u2018bloat\u2018.\nThe main reason why hippos are often found near bodies of water is that this is how they stay cool and prevent sunburn. During the hot daytime a hippo will either stay in water or mud in order to cool down.\nHippos may be seen near each other at rest, but feeding is done in solo and they are not territorial on land. The hippo generally grazes after dusk when it is cooler.\nThey are characterized by their barrel-shaped torsos. The hippo mouth is wide and open which contains large canine tusks. They have bodies that contain little hair, short columnar legs and can weigh up to 4,400 pounds for males and females are slightly smaller at 2,800-pounds.\nThere are two species of hippo, the modern hippopotamus and the pygmy hippopotamus, which is native to the forests and swamps of West Africa, primarily in Liberia.\nThe female hippo has a gestation period of eight months. Baby hippos are born underwater and will weigh between 55 and 100-pounds and will be about 4-feet long. They must swim to the surface in order to take their first breath of air. A normal birth rate is a single calf, but twins are not uncommon.\nMothers are very protective of their young and calves are often left together in \u2018nurseries\u2019 which are usually watched by one or more adults. While in these nurseries, the baby hippos will engage in play fights which prepare them for when they must fend for themselves.\nWhile the hippo used to be found all over the sub-Saharan area of Africa, their modern habitat is much smaller \u2013 barely a fraction of the size! This loss of habitat is one reason why they\u2019re now considered a vulnerable species.\nInteresting Hippo Facts\n1. Hippos are the deadliest large land animal on the planet\nThe Hippopotamus is one of the most dangerous animals in the world, killing an estimated 500 people a year in Africa.\nThey are extremely aggressive, unpredictable, have sharp teeth and can crush a human or predator to death with relative ease due to their size.\nIn one 2014 case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed.\n2. Hippos love the water!\nThe hippopotamus is a semi-aquatic mammal. This means that even though they\u2019re a mammal like humans, dogs, cats, and other similar species, they spend a majority of their life in the water. Their historic habitat even included the Nile River.\nThey love the water so much that the Greeks had named them river horses!\nHowever, they only spend their days in the water. By night, they\u2019re on the land and grazing for up to 6 hours.\n3. There\u2019s only one wild herd famous outside of Africa\u2026\nAnd it has its roots entangled with Pablo Escobar!\nDuring his time, Escobar ran a private zoo which featured hippopotamuses. After he left, however, they escaped into the wild and continued to thrive in Colombia, where they are now part of a herd of at least 80.\nSince the hippo is an invasive species in this area that could damage the river ecosystems and native wildlife, there are now efforts to help reduce their ability to reproduce, providing a more humane way to halt the growth of the herd.\n4. The hippo is a victim of ivory poaching\nWhen you think about poaching and ivory, you probably think about rhinos and elephants. However, the hippopotamus is also a victim of this crime, which is another reason aside from habitat loss that they\u2019re endangered.\nWhile they may not have tusks or horns, the hippo\u2019s front teeth are made of ivory. This ivory is harder than an elephants, making it more durable but more difficult to carve.\nThe incisors can reach 40 cm (1 ft 4 in), while the canines reach up to 50 cm (1 ft 8 in).\n5. They can eat around 35 kg of grass in a single night\u2026every night!\nEver heard the saying \u201chungry as a hippo\u201d? There\u2019s more truth to that than meets the eye!\nDuring the night, when hippos return to land, they spend up to six hours grazing on grass and any fallen fruit they might stumble across. In a single night, a single hippopotamus can easily eat 35 kilograms of grass!\nNot sure just how impressive that is? Some other things that weigh around 35 kilograms are a small sofa, a chest freezer, a single twin bed (frame and mattress included), and medium size dryer.\nImagine eating an entire dryer\u2019s worth of weight in your favorite food every day!\n6. Hippos can open their mouths at almost 180 degrees\nHippos can open their mouths over 50cms wide, and their jaw hinge is located far back, allowing them to open at almost 180 degrees.\nHippopotamus bite force measures 12 600 kPa. By comparison, a lion\u2019s bite force is only 4500 kPa.\nThe hippopotamus, with his ferocious jaw force, unique mouth size and sharp teeth, can easily bisect a human body in a single bite!\n7. They can reach top speeds over 40 kph\nAt a first glance, you may think that the hippopotamus is one of the slowest animals around. After all, they have odd proportions and weigh a ton (literally).\nHowever, while they\u2019re not the fastest animal by far, the hippopotamus can reach top speeds over 40 kph when they\u2019re running on land. This is around the same speed as a moped!\nAs a result, a human has no hope of out running one of these massive mammals. That\u2019s one reason why hippos kill more humans in Africa each year than any other species, including big cats.\n8. Predators are only really a threat when a hippo is alone\nTaking a quick look out our hippopotamus profile, you\u2019ll notice that these mostly water dwellers have quite a few predators both in the water and on land. From big cats to hyenas to crocodiles, there are many animals that pose a threat to the hippopotamus.\nHowever, only when they\u2019re alone.\nThere\u2019s a reason that hippos travel in dense herds. While they\u2019re easy targets alone, an entire herd of hippopotamuses can easily throw their weight around.\nWith the strongest bite strength of all land animals and a knack for aggression, the hippopotamus can easily defend itself so long as its not out numbered. They\u2019ve even been known to chase down human boats!\n9. Hippos can\u2019t swim\nThe most surprising fact of them all? Hippos can\u2019t swim!\nThat\u2019s right, despite how much they love the water and having webbed feet, hippos aren\u2019t actually the best swimmers. They aren\u2019t even swimmers at all! Instead, they have such a high body density that they sink right to the bottom of the river where, instead of swimming, they gallop through the water.\nTurns out they earned the name \u201criver horse\u201d for many reasons! Fortunately hipppos can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes.\n10. They weigh as much as a car\nAdult male hippos can weigh about 3,300-pounds with females reaching 2,800-pounds. Very large males can grow to 4,400-pounds with exceptional large ones reaching 5,800-pounds.\n11. A Hippo can live to become a senior citizen\nThe average lifespan of a hippopotamus is between 40 and 50 years.\nHowever, the oldest living hippo in captivity set a record when she died in 2017. Bertha was a resident of the Manila Zoo in the Phillipines. At the time of her death she was 65.\n12. Hippos can be traced back about 52-million years ago\nA total of six species of Hippopotamus are extinct with three of them being subspecies of the Malagasy Hippopotamus.\nThese species were much smaller in size than the modern hippo with the last of them disappearing in the past century.\nThere are also three species of the European Hippopotamus that have become extinct.\n13. Hippos engage in \u2018muck-spreading\u2019\nThis involves marking territory with their own faeces \u2013 by spinning their tail which acts as a fan to spread their faeces over a greater area!\nGross!\n14. They can sleep underwater\nHippos are able to sleep while fully submerged underwater, intermittently surfacing to the surfce using a reflex that allows them to take a breath, before sinking back down \u2013 without waking up!\nWhen completely submerged, their ears and nostrils fold shut to keep water out.\n15. The IUCN lists hippos as vulnerable\nHippos are thought to have a stable population estimated between 115,000 and 130,000 animals.\nSadly however, hippos are considered vulnerable due to loss of access to fresh water and being subject to poaching.\nHippo Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Giraffe Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Giraffe-facts.html", "text": "giraffe Facts\nPortrait of a Giraffe\nThe giraffe and its closest relative the okapi are the last survivors of the once plentiful Giraffidae family. While the okapi is a solitary, forest dwelling creature rarely seen, the giraffe is a true show stopper, herds of which wander in surprising abundance across the African savanna.\nToday the giraffe is the tallest animal on Earth, with males topping out at about 18 feet at the tip of the horns (called occicones), and 11 feet at the shoulder.\nAlthough no fossil trail exists, it is assumed the giraffe developed its remarkable physique and out-survived its relatives, by reaching for the treetops.\nAs taller individuals ate leaves and fruits unavailable to shorter individuals, the giraffe thrived, and became more and more specialized. While the 6 to 8 foot long, 600 pound neck is most obvious, the giraffes entire body is a masterpiece of specialization.\nViewed from the side, the giraffes shoulder region is towering, with a highly elongated pectoral girdle which gives the illusion that the front legs are longer than the rear. Front and rear legs are about the same length, however, between 5.5 and 6 feet long.\nWhile the relatively short back has vertebrae of a median size, the vertebrae of the neck, are stretched to about 11 inches long, They still have the standard 7 neck vertebrae found in most mammals, including us, but they are not only elongated, but also articulate far more than ours.\nThe neck is supported by powerful muscles and reinforced ligaments which anchor to vertebrae between the shoulder blades, and form a hump where the back and neck meet.\nThe head is refined, streamlined and equipped with an 18 inch long tongue for even further reach.\nBoth males and females have horns known as \"occicones\", which are formed from cartilage and covered with skin. Females have thinner occicones, that are tufted with longer hair on top. Males occicones are larger, have knobs on the ends, and become bald on top as they mature.\nGiraffes live in very loose groups of 3 to 40 or so, mostly related individuals. They are not territorial, and their social structure is very peaceful and cooperative..\nThough the giraffe is the worlds tallest animal, it is, by mammal standards, remarkably peaceful, with very little territorial drive. Even aggression between adult bulls is limited to largely harmless \"necking\" displays.\nMales and females mingle, young are protected by herd members, and individuals take turns looking out for eachother while drinking or napping.\nGiraffes have a \"fission-fusion\" society, that means groups come together and break apart freely, and friendships and alliances are loose and varied.\nWhat Sound Does a Giraffe Make?\nWhile some may incorrectly report that giraffes make no sounds at all, they are, in fact, diverse in vocalizations, emitting grunts, snorts and flute-like noises of different meaning. Giraffe vocalizations are infrequent, however, and are usually at very low volume. The loudest giraffe calls are from baby giraffes separated from their mother - these are robust, guttural grunts that sound very much like the calls of large adult deer such as elk.\nThe length between lungs and vocal chords could be the reason why there is a limit on the production and volume of giraffe noises, but new research has also found that giraffes make sounds we simply can't hear because they are at too low a frequency. In 2015, it was discovered and documented that giraffes in zoos hummed to eachother. This humming was only at night, and only in the dark, and far too low for humans to hear. - Amazing!\nhow do giraffes sleep?\nBecause they are always on the move and always eating, even overnight, t was once thought that giraffes never sleep. After lots of observation it was discovered that the giraffe sleeps 1 or 2 hours a day, and usually only a few minutes at a time. Adults generally sleep standing up, while youngsters lie down and rest their head on their rump.\nWhat do giraffes eat and how do they drink?\nLike cows, giraffes have multiple stomach chambers and \"chew their cud\", meaning they regurgitate partially digested food back up their 6 foot long throat, to re-chew it one mouthful at a time.\nWith this method, they get as much nutrients as they can from the leaves and fruits they consume. The giraffes top lip, and its 18 inch long tongue, are not only prehensile, allowing them to grasp leaves and branches, but are also extraordinarily tough, protecting them from damage as they munch on the leaves from their favorite tree the Acacia - which has 3 inch long thorns! Giraffes have a hard thickness of tissue called the \"dental pad\" in place of the top front teeth, which they grind their food against. Giraffes are some of the largest land animals, and need up to 70 pounds of food a day to survive. They spend almost all of their time grazing among, tall branches for herbs, vines, flowers and fruits, but will lower their heads and graze off the ground if something is tempting enough. Because their legs are so long, they must either bend the front legs, or spread them awkwardly wide, especially to drink. This is a vulnerable position for them, and herd members will take turns looking out for predators while others drink. They can go for long periods without water, and regularly go for days without a drink.\nWhat are giraffe predators?\nGiraffe kills a hyena\nBecause of their immense size, healthy adult giraffes have little to fear out on the savanna. They are extremely cautious, with excellent hearing and eyesight, and effortlessly swift if they spot danger. But more importantly, a giraffes kick can be lethal to even the largest predator.\nGiraffes have been known to kill leopards, hyenas, African wild dogs and adult male lions with a few - and sometimes just one- well-aimed strikes. They can kick with front and rear legs, and are simply too great a risk for even the hungriest on the plains.\nWhile they are still young, however, giraffe calves may fall prey to any of the large predators on the Savanna. Mothers will try to defend their young, but about half of the baby giraffes born will be lost in the first 6 months.\nherd of Masai girrafes\na few more giraffe facts\ngiraffes snuggling\nThe giraffe is the largest ruminant and the worlds tallest animal\nMale giraffes can be 18 feet tall at the top of the horns\nGiraffes have 2 to 5 horns called \"occicones\"\nThe giraffes neck is 6 to 8 feet long and can weigh over 600 pounds\nGiraffes \"chew their cud\" just like cows\nGiraffes defend themselves by kicking\nA giraffes kick can kill a lion!\nThe giraffes tongue is about 18 inches long\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Giraffidae\nGenus Giraffa\nSpecies camelopardalis\nGiraffe Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd HOME HABITAT LIFESPAN FAVORITE FOOD Africa Asia savanna 20-25 years acacai leaves ENEMIES GENDER DIFFERENCE AVG.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Leopard Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Leopard-facts.html", "text": "leopard Facts\nPortrait of a Leopard\nThe leopard is the smallest of the four Big Cats, but is probably the most powerful pound-for-pound. They have amazingly strong necks and shoulders, and are able to carry prey often heavier than themselves, high up into the branches of trees where other predators can't reach.\nThe leopard's climbing ability sets it apart from the other big cats and has made it the most successful of the group as far as its numbers in the wild.\nAlthough leopards in Asia are critically endangered, the African leopard is quite numerous and estimates are that there are close to 500,000 wild leopards in existence.\nThat number is nearly ten times the number of all wild lions, tigers and cheetahs combined.\nTheir tree climbing prowess doesn't just give them the means to keep their kills safe, it also provides them a quick escape from the many animals on the African plains that can make life tough.\nThe leopard is a gifted, swift and effective hunter, but it is less than half the size of a mature lioness, has nowhere near the pugnacious tendencies of a hyena, and wouldn't stand a chance against a pack of African wild dogs.\nWhile the cheetah hunts in daylight in plain sight of any other predators that might want to steal it's prey, the leopard hunts almost exclusively by night, and it is a notoriously silent killer. One of the things that makes the rare man-eating leopard so incredibly lethal.\nAn older or injured leopard that can no longer take wild game, may find an easier mark in a nearby African village.\nWhile the man-eating tiger will kill humans mostly out in its own territory, leopards who resort to preying on humans are so swiftly deadly that they have been known to take people from their beds without other house mates hearing. - Leopard Facts\ncool leopard facts\nAsiatic lions\nThe leopard is a stunningly beautiful animal with a coat of buff to bright orange strewn with circles of spots called \"rosettes\". Sometimes their spots are actually square in shape.\nThere is also a type of coloration known as melanism which is an increase in dark pigment of the skin and fur which occurs in about 6% of all leopards and results in what is known as a \"black panther\".\nFrom a distance, Black panthers appear to be solid black in color, but close up you can actually see black spots on the coat.\nThe other spotted big cat, the jaguar, is very similar in appearance to the leopard and easily mistaken for one. Jaguars are generally much larger and more bulky than leopards and have much broader, rounder heads with smaller ears and eyes.\nBecause of their bulk, they do not share the leopards excellent climbing abilities, and so their lifestyle is more like that of a tiger than a leopard.\nMelanism occurs in jaguars as well, at approximately the same rate as in leopards, and the term \"black panther\" applies to melanistic individuals of both species.\nstunning leopards\nleopard reproduction\nleopard mother and baby\nLeopards are loners and live the most solitary lives of all the big cats.\nIn fact, unless they are paired up during a few short days of mating, adult leopards are almost never seen together.\nThe only time leopards spend in close company is the first 1 1/2 to 2 years of life spent with mom. After that, and once the youngster leaves, they have no further contact with their mother, and no contact at all with their father who never hangs around after mating is over.\nLeopards mark their territories in the same way as many cats do, with scent marking using urine sprays and sight markings leaving deep claw marks in selected tree trunks.\nA male leopards territory is thought to be three times as big as the females, and will overlap or completely encompass one or more females home ranges. Even so, they will avoid each other, making husky coughing type sounds as they patrol to let others know its time to clear out.\nConfrontations are rare because great effort seems to be taken to have no close contact, but they will keep tabs on each other by visiting the sites that their neighbors regularly mark and scent.\nFemales come into season several times a year until impregnated. When looking for a mate she makes a rowling sound similar to a house cat in heat.\nA male and female will pair up for 4 or 5 days, after which the male leaves for good.\nThe pregnant female will find a safe den and have a small litter of 1 to 3 cubs on average. More than 3 is possible, but rare. Newborn leopard cubs are a dark grey in color, an abundance of fuzzy fur, and very faint - if any- spots.\nLeopards, particularly in Asia, regularly give birth to just one cub. Because of this, and because of the leopards naturally seclusive lifestyle, survival rate is actually very good for young leopards compared to some other cats.\nOne of their most common enemies are snakes who may find little cubs alone, waiting for their mother to return from a hunt. Lions are a threat as well, and lions will kill young leopards if given a chance.\nLions have also been known to actively pursue and kill adult leopards without any interest in eating them. Solitary male lions in particular seem to make almost a sport out of trying to catch both leopards and, even more often, cheetahs.\nThe leopards greatest defense and greatest asset is how it lives its life, quietly and with unparalleled stealth. - Leopard Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The other subspecies, spread through little pockets along Southern Asia, India, and up through the Russian far east.\nAt the highest Northern altitudes, leopards can be found living in mountain regions where the temperatures regularly dip below freezing. In some areas they live alongside Siberian tigers, but tend to exist along the snow line and avoid areas that get any real snow accumulations.\nAll of the Asian subspecies are endangered, and some may even be extinct to date.\nThe exceedingly rare Amur leopard of Korea, China and East Russia is on the crest of extinction with numbers of less than 30 in the wild.\nThe leopards notorious stealth, however, makes it hard to determine true numbers, and the leopard, no matter where its home range may be, remains by far the most difficult big cat to record and photograph.\nthe balancing act\nThe leopard is a very large carnivore with exceptional hardware that would give it the edge in allot of tough neighborhoods.\nIn areas of Asia where tigers are not in their range they are king of the jungle. But out on the African plains, the leopard is definitely not the apex predator. Surrounded by lions, hyenas and African wild dogs, harassed by vultures, jackals and even baboons, a hungry leopard must not only kill quickly and quietly, but also take its bounty to the trees in a hurry.\nLeopards stash large kills in the crooks of branches where they can eat in peace and even leave the carcass for a few days with some confidence that heavy lions and non-climbing pests just can't reach the cache.\nHaving the power to take down and maneuver very large prey, coupled with the agility to climb higher than the competition, works hand in hand, as a large kill does not go to waste on the floor of the savanna..\nWith a large kill the leopard will climb to a safe height, eat its fill, and then return for a number of days to feast on the carcass, occasionally having to fetch body parts from the ground if they become detached while it feeds.\nA somewhat surreal and gruesome sight to see, a leopard may have a favorite tree with particularly handy niches for hanging corpses, and in Central Africa it is not unheard of to see whole antelope, gazelle, even immature giraffe carcasses hanging from a tree thirty feet off the ground. - Leopard Facts\nand the leopards far removed\nThere are two cat species regularly referred to as leopards that are not closely related to the true leopard. Both the snow leopard and the clouded leopard are in the subfamily pantherinae and are not big cats.\nThere are attempts to classify the snow leopard as a member of panthera, with the belief that it is actually related to the Siberian tiger, but the snow leopard lacks the ability to roar, which has separated that genus for decades.\nBoth the snow leopard and the smaller clouded leopard live in mountainous areas of Asia including the Himalayas.\nThe snow leopard exists in higher altitude and is specially equipped for freezing temperatures with exceptionally thick fur and a very stocky build.\nThe clouded leopard lives in dense forest and is rarely seen. It has massive fangs and claws for its size, and a beautifully marbled coat.\nBoth of these cats are considered an evolutionary stepping stone from smaller cats like the ocelot, to the true big cats.\na few more leopard facts\nThe leopard is the best climber of the big cats..\nLeopards can drag prey twice their size high up into trees to keep them from scavengers\nThere are more leopards in the wild than lions, tigers and cheetahs combined.\nA leopards spots are really circles of spots called \"rosettes\" that may be round or square in shape depending on the region.\nLeopards hang their kill in trees.\nAlthough they are rarely in groups, a group of leopards is called a \"leap\" or a \"prowl\"\nLeopards can be found both in rainforests and in the snow covered wilderness of Siberia\nLeopards are also known as panthers.\nA black panther is a leopard with melanistic coat coloration.\nBlack panthers have faintly visible spots..\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Carnivora\nFamily Felidae\nGenus Panthera\nSpecies pardus\nSub-species\n9 subspecies\nLeopard Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT leopard leopardess cub solitary GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD leap, prowl Africa, Asia jungle, savanna rabbit, gazelle ENEMIES AVG.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion information - wildlife-pictures-online.com", "url": "http://www.wildlife-pictures-online.com/lion-information.html", "text": "Lion Information Quick Lion Facts Family: Felidae (Cats)\nScientific name: Panthera leo\nAverage shoulder height: Males - 1.2 m;\nFemales - 90 cm.\nWeight: Males - 190 kg; Females - 130 kg.\nGestation period: 110 days\nLife expectancy: 13 -15 yrs\nLion cub, showing faint spots on the lower parts Appearance\nThe lion, tawny to sandy brown in colour, is the largest of the African carnivores. Cubs are faintly spotted on the lower parts; some adults retain traces of the spots. Adult males have manes that vary in colour from tawny to black. This, together with their larger size, distinguishes them from females. Behavior\nLions live a lazy lifestyle, typically active for only two to four hours in every 24. They are most active at night and rest during the day. A lion pride consists of a group of two to 12 closely related adult females with their young, attended by one to six adult males. If there is more than one male they are often, but not always, close relatives, often brothers. Only pride males have access to the pride females. Males take over prides by driving out the current males in savage and sometimes fatal fights, and are in turn displaced by new challengers after one to 10 years. The new males expel any young males from the pride and try to kill all the cubs to bring the females quickly back into breeding condition and so ensure offspring will have their genes. After a take-over females come into heat and mate but, amazingly, do not bear cubs until the new males have established their status against possible challengers. Reproduction\nFemales give birth to litters of up to six cubs (usually one to four). Weaning starts at 10 weeks, and is completed by six months. Lions mate about four times an hour over two to three days! Pride males do not compete for available females as these females will mate with all of a pride's males in turn as each loses interest in her. Pride females suckle one another's cubs, with no bias towards their own. Hunting\nLions differ from other cats by regularly hunting in groups. When hunting small prey, each lion pursues its own animal; with larger and more dangerous prey co-operation is needed to split a herd or pull down and kill one animal. Most of the hunting is done by the females. When in a pride, the males take what food they want from the females. Cubs get what the adults leave, and in times of food shortage, starvation is their major cause of death. Diet\nMedium and large prey, including impala, wildebeest, zebra and gemsbok. Will also take larger species such as buffalo, giraffe, hippo and young elephants. Lions will also eats birds, reptiles, fish, and even insects, also smaller mammals down to the size of mice. Sounds\nTo hear the roar of lions at night is an experience to be savoured - provided you're safely in your tent or bungalow. Typically a lion's roar will start with a series of low grunts, building to a reverberating crescendo before trailing off again. Lions also grunt, cough and snarl.

Play-fighting enables the lions to practice their battle skills which is useful for tackling prey and it also helps to establish relationships among the pride members.

The last known adult specimen of this big-maned lion was shot in South Africa in 1858, and a juvenile was captured by an explorer a couple of decades later (it didn't survive long out of the wild). The trouble is, the various extant subspecies of lions have a tendency to interbreed and mix up their genes, so it may yet turn out that Cape Lions were an isolated tribe of Transvaal Lions, the remnants of which can still be found in South Africa.\nThe Cape Lion has the dubious honor of being one of the few big cats to have been hunted, rather than harassed, into extinction: most individuals were shot and killed by European settlers, rather than slowly starving due to habitat loss or poaching of their accustomed prey. For a while, in the early 2000s, it seemed that the Cape Lion might be de-extincted: a zoo director from South Africa discovered a population of big-maned lions in Russia's Novosibirsk Zoo, and announced plans to perform genome testing and (if the results were positive for fragments of Cape Lion DNA) attempt to re-breed the Cape Lion back into existence. Unfortunately, the zoo director died in 2010 and the Novosibirsk Zoo closed a couple of years later, leaving these putative Cape Lion descendants in limbo."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "California sea lion | Smithsonian's National Zoo", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/california-sea-lion", "text": "Physical Description\nSea lions, along with fur seals, are considered eared seals. Their visible ear flaps distinguish them from true seals. They also use their fore flippers to propel themselves through the water, whereas true seals rely primarily on their back flippers to swim.\nMales are generally a dark chestnut brown, although some males have lighter coloring on their head, muzzle, sides, hind and belly. Females and juveniles are usually tan. Both sexes have a sleek, single hair coat, which also distinguishes them from true seals.\nAt about 5 years old, males develop a noticeable crest that runs lengthwise along the top of their skull creating a high, domed forehead. The fur on this crest usually becomes increasingly lighter as a sea lion ages.\nCalifornia sea lions lack the \"mane\" that gives sea lions their name. They also have a more slender neck than some species and a dog-like head.\nCalifornia sea lions have many adaptations for their aquatic lifestyle. Their limbs are short with elongated digits encased in cartilage and connective tissue to form flippers. They have strong, bulky shoulders and their streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies taper to the tail.\nTheir front flippers are especially long and are used for propelling them through the water. Their back flippers are used as rudders and have three claws for grooming.\nOn land, these sea lions move by rotating their rear flippers under their bodies and supporting their body weight on all four flippers. Although California sea lions appear clumsy when moving on land, their movement through the water appears almost effortless.\nThe flexibility of their bodies allows them to make tight, twisting turns as they play or pursue fish, and they can quickly reach speeds of 25-30 mph (40-48 kph) while hunting, avoiding predators or simply playing.\nA layer of blubber, or fat, insulates the sea lion's body, and the circulatory system can shunt the blood supply to the extremities and outer surface of the body. Meanwhile, a layer of fur traps water next to the skin nad warms it to body temperature. The California sea lion's small body surface in proportion to its volume also reduces the amount of heat lost to its surroundings.\nOverheating can often be a problem for California sea lions, and they use behavioral means to cool off, such as resting with a flipper in the water, flipping sand over their back or flipper fanning in the water."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "liger | Size & Facts | Britannica", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/animal/liger", "text": "liger, offspring of a male lion and a female tiger. The liger is a zoo-bred hybrid, as is the tigon, which is the result of mating a male tiger with a female lion. The liger and the tigon possess features of both parents, in variable proportions, but are generally larger than either. It is thought that most, if not all, male ligers and tigons are sterile. The females, however, on occasion, may be able to produce young. The terms liger and tigon are portmanteaus of the words lion and tiger.\nLigers tend to be larger and heavier than members of their parent species. Biologists suggest that the liger\u2019s large size, or \u201cgrowth dysplasia,\u201d results from the absence of certain growth-limiting genes. Female lions mate with several male lions throughout their lives, so the genes of a male lion are adapted to maximize the growth of his offspring, since his offspring may be required to compete with those of other males produced by the same lioness. The genes of female lions, however, are adapted to cancel or dampen the effects of the growth-maximizing genes of male lions, so lions remain within a given size range. Tigers, on the other hand, have no such competitive mating strategy, and many biologists argue that tigresses do not possess the growth-limiting adaptations of their lioness counterparts. As a result, the influence of the growth-maximizing adaptations provided by male lions is greater, which allows ligers to become larger than their parents. However, for tigons, growth-limiting genes are found in both male tigers and female lions, so their offspring possess an abundance of these genes, which accounts for their smaller size.\nliger A liger, the result of a mating between a male lion and a female tiger in a captive environment. In nature, interbreeding between these separate species is prevented by prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms (RIMs), such as differences in behaviour, and by nonbiological factors, such as differences in range. Most, if not all, male ligers and many female ligers that arise by accident or intent do not develop functional sex cells. Such hybrid sterility is a postzygotic RIM. Sally Anne Thompson/Animal Photography Partnership\nThe largest ligers often grow to lengths of more than 3.3 metres (10.8 feet) and weigh more than 400 kg (900 pounds); however, there are reports of some individuals weighing more than 1,000 kg (1 metric ton [about 2,200 pounds]). Tigons, in contrast, tend to be the same size or smaller than their parents, because the growth-limiting genes are carried by both parents.\nAlthough lions and tigers may mate in the wild, they are separated by geography and behaviour, and thus all known ligers stem from accidental mating between lions and tigers as well as from directed breeding efforts that have occurred while in captivity. The first known breeding of a lion and a tigress in captivity likely occurred sometime during the late 1700s. Roughly 100 ligers and fewer than 100 tigons are thought to exist. Many national governments and animal-rights organizations view the practice of breeding lions and tigers as unethical, because ligers often acquire birth defects that result in death shortly after birth and are prone to obesity and abnormal growth that places stress on their internal organs. In addition, ligers and tigons have problems interacting with members of their parent species because their behavioral traits often manifest as a mix of the habits of both species rather than either one or the other (see also animal social behaviour). Other opponents of liger breeding point out that ligers often take up valuable space in zoos that could be better used as habitat for endangered species."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "ADW: Panthera leo: INFORMATION - Animal Diversity Web", "url": "https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Panthera_leo/", "text": "Geographic Range African lions (Panthera leo) live in most of sub-Saharan Africa except in desert and rainforest habitats. Lions were once exterminated from South Africa, where they remain in Kruger and Kalahari Gemsbok National Parks and possibly some other protected areas. Lions once ranged throughout southwest Asia and north Africa. Asiatic lions (P. l. persica) belong to the single remaining subspecies in this region. Once roaming from Greece to central India, Asiatic lions persist in the Gir forest of northwest India. (\"Asiatic Lion Information Center\", 2001; Alden, et al., 1998; Estes, 1993) In addition to the asiatic subspecies, many taxonomists contend that there are five extant African subspecies. Each subspecies is identified by geographic region. Panthera leo senegalensis (west African or Senegalese lions), P. l. azandica (north east Congo lions), P. l. bleyenberghi (Katanga, Angolan, or south Congo lions), and P. l. krugeri (south African or Transvaal lions). Panthera leo krugeri includes Kalahari lions (sometimes denoted as P. l. verneyi). Lastly, there are East African lions (P. l. nubica). These animals have been categorized as Somali lions (P. l. somaliensis), Masai lions (P. l. massaicus), Serengeti lions (P. l. massaicus), Congo lions (P. l. hollisteri), and Abyssinian lions (P. l. roosevelti). It should be noted, however, that there is some debate as to the validity of the African subspecies classifications, leaving only the Asiatic subspecies, P. l. persica, uncontested. (O'Brien, et al., 1987; Urban and West, 2002) Biogeographic Regions\npalearctic native\noriental native\nethiopian native\nPhysical Description Lions are large cats with short, tawny coats, white underparts, and long tails with a black tuft at the end. They are sexually dimorphic and male lions are the only cats with manes. Three year-old male lions grow manes that vary in color from black to blond. Manes tend to be fuller in open habitats. Adult males typically weigh 189 kg; the heaviest male on record weighed 272 kg (Mount Kenya). Females weigh 126 kg on average. The average male height is 1.2 m and the average female height is 1.1 m. Length ranges from 2.4 to 3.3 m and tail length ranges from 0.6 to 1.0 m; the longest male lion recorded was 3.3 m. Cubs have brown spots on a grayish coat until the age of three months; spots may remain on stomach, especially in east Africa. Albinism does occur in some populations, but there are no published records of melanism (black fur) in lions. Adult lions have 30 total teeth and adult females have four mammae. (Alden, et al., 1998; Cat Specialist Group, 1996; Estes, 1993; Urban and West, 2002) Asiatic lions (P. l. persica) are slightly smaller than African lions and have shorter manes, thicker elbow and tail tufts, and longitudinal skin folds on their stomachs. Although Asiatic lions are genetically distinct from African lions, the genetic difference between the two species is smaller than that between human races.

It is estimated that lions copulate 3,000 times for every cub that survives over one year. One estrus out of every 5 results in a litter and lions mate approximately 2.2 times per hour for the 4 day estrus period. The first male member of a pride that reaches a female in heat has the mating priority over her. Fighting between pride members over females does not normally occur. (Estes, 1993) Male lions are conspicuously large and showy because they have the opportunity to control the reproduction of many females when they rule over a pride. Males form coalitions with each other to increase their chances of pride takeover. The fierce competition among males and the social structure of a pride have led to infanticide by both males and females. Successful males that takeover a pride have about 2 years before another younger, stronger coalition will replace them. Pride takeover battles are often violent leading to severe injury or death of the losing lions. It is to the successful male\u2019s reproductive advantage to kill the suckling cubs of the defeated males. A nursing lioness that loses her cubs will come back into estrous within 2 to 3 weeks. The normal time between births is 2 years, which is the typical time for a male to rule a pride. Therfore, by killing all unweaned cubs at the time of pride takeover, males can ensure that they have some opportunity to father offspring of females who would otherwise not be available to them during their tenure as pride leaders. Females vigorously defend their cubs during a takeover and are sometimes killed also. (Estes, 1993; Packer and Pusey, 2001) Mating System\npolygynous\ncooperative breeder Female lions are polyestrous, breeding throughout the year and peaking in the rainy season. Female lions tend to have cubs every 2 years. However, if a female's cubs are killed (usually by an intruding male lion), then the female comes into estrus early and has more cubs. Females are able to breed at 4 years of age and males at 5 years. (Alden, et al., 1998; Estes, 1993; Schaller, 1972) One to six cubs are born after a 3.5 month gestation period. There is an interbirth interval of approximately twenty to thirty months. Newborn cubs weigh 1 to 2 kg. Eyes typically open by 11 days, cubs can walk by 15 days and are able to run by 1 month of age. Mother lions keep their cubs in hiding until they reach about 8 weeks of age. The cubs are weaned between 7 and 10 months, however they are dependent upon adults in the pride until they are at least 16 months old. (Estes, 1993; Schaller, 1972) Key Reproductive Features\niteroparous\nyear-round breeding\ngonochoric/gonochoristic/dioecious (sexes separate)\nsexual\nfertilization Breeding interval Female lions tend to have cubs every 2 years.

Females nurse their young, but will also nurse the young of their female relatives in the pride if litters are born close together. Cub mortality is lowest when related females in the same pride synchronously reproduce and cross-suckle. Since synchronous reproduction is common in prides, cubs are often raised in cr\u00e8ches where the entire pride helps to raise several litters. (Estes, 1993; Urban and West, 2002) Cubs are often left alone for more than one full day by the time they are 5 to 7 months old. This is a particularly vulnerable time for the cubs to be attacked by predators (often hyenas). Hungry mothers occasionally abandon weak cubs that can not keep up with the pride. (Estes, 1993) Although males do not directly provide care for the young in a pride, they are important in the protection of the cubs from rival males. So long as a male maintains control over a pride, preventing another male from taking over, the cubs he has sired are at lower risk of infanticide.

There can be anywhere from 2 to 40 lions in a pride. In Kruger and Serengeti National Parks, pride size was on average 13 lions. The average composition of these prides was 1.7 adult males, 4.5 adult females, 3.8 subadults, and 2.8 juveniles. (Estes, 1993; Packer and Pusey, 2001) The resident males of a pride are immigrants that have forcefully gained control of the pride from the previous male members. In order to successfully take over a pride, males form coalitions, usually consisting of brothers. Adolescent males leave their natal pride when their fathers (or the new male leaders of the pride) begin to view them as competition at about 2.5 years. These males lead nomadic lives for two to three years, then form a coalition and seek a pride to take over. Male coalitions of 2 tend to rule a pride for no more than two and a half years, long enough for one set of cubs to be reared. Coalitions of three and four tend to rule a pride for longer than 3 years. Coalitions of more than four are rare, most likely because large coalitions are difficult to keep together. (Estes, 1993; Packer, et al., 1990) Prides are comprised of related females. Females are lifelong residents in their mother\u2019s territory. Female pridemates do not compete or fight with each other and do not display the kinds of dominance behavior that are observed in many matriarchal social systems. Related females in the same pride tend to have synchronous reproduction, and they cross-suckle their cubs. This cooperative behavior discourages dominance behavior. In contrast, males are very aggressive with other pride members, especially when feeding. The lack of dominance among females may have made it easier for communal cub-raising, since females are unable to influence the reproduction of other female pride members. Alternatively, the mutualistic benefits of communal cub-raising may have reduced the tendency to form pride hierarchies. Lions have the great ability to critically injure or kill other lions when engaged in a fight. Fighting with a pridemate of similar age and sex not only threatens the survival of the individual but also risks injuring a valuable team-member that could later help to defend the pride against intruders. It would seem, therefore, that intrapride aggression would be selected against. (Estes, 1993; Packer and Pusey, 2001) The lions of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania have been studied continuously since 1966. Research has shown that lions form groups for many reasons besides greater hunting efficiency. Because lions live at higher population densities than other large cats, there is a great need for pride members to collectively defend their territory against takeovers by other lions. Also, lionesses reproduce synchronously and form highly stable groups that defend their cubs against infanticide. Finally, smaller prides tend to be more gregarious than larger prides in order to defend their territory as a group. (Packer, et al., 1990) Areas that have the greatest variety and total biomass of hoofed mammals (prey) in open habitats can support up to 12 lions per 100 km^2. In an area with bountiful prey, lions spend approximately twenty hours per day sleeping. They become most active in the late afternoon, mainly socializing with the pride. Hunting typically takes place at night and into the hours of the early morning. Lastly, lions have a common greeting ritual of rubbing heads together with tails looped in the air, while moaning. (Estes, 1993) Key Behaviors\nterricolous\nnocturnal\ncrepuscular\nmotile\nnomadic\nsedentary\nterritorial\nsocial Range territory size 20 to 400 km^2 Home Range Home range sizes of African lions depend on the prey density. Home ranges can be from 20 to 400 km^2. (Estes, 1993)\nCommunication and Perception Lions have the cognitive ability to recognize individuals and to interact with other lions to benefit their own survival. They use visual cues in this communication. For example, the mane is thought to signal to other lions the sex of a male from a distance and to indicate individual fitness. (The rate of mane development is mostly controlled by testosterone.) Resident male lions regularly mark their territory by spraying vegetation with urine and by scuff-marking. Females spray occasionally. This behavior starts at the age of 2 years. This type of marking uses both chemical and visual communication signals. Male lions start to roar at 1 year of age and females start shortly after this. The male\u2019s roar is both louder and deeper than the female's. Lions can roar at any time, but they typically stand or crouch while roaring. Roaring serves to advertise territories, to communicate with other pride members, and to demonstrate aggressions toward enemy lions. Lions also roar in chorus; this may be a form of social bonding. This is accoustic communication. Finally, lions use tactile communication. Males engage in physical aggression during pride take over. There is touching during greetings between pride members. Physical communication passes between lactating females and the cubs they are nursing. (Estes, 1993; Grinnel, et al., 1995; Schaller, 1972; Urban and West, 2002) Communication Channels\nvisual\ntactile\nacoustic\nchemical Other Communication Modes\nchoruses\nscent marks Perception Channels\nvisual\ntactile\nacoustic\nchemical\nEcosystem Roles Lions are the top predators in their range. It is not clear to what extent lions regulate their prey population; some studies have shown that food availability plays a larger role in regulating prey populations than consumption by lions. (Eltringham, 1979)\nEconomic Importance for Humans: Positive Lions are a glamorous species, well-known throughout the world. They are a cultural icon in England and are one of the highest valued eco-tourism species in Africa. They are also the subject of many documentaries and research efforts. (Dudley, 2002) Positive Impacts\necotourism\nresearch and education\nEconomic Importance for Humans: Negative Humans are fearful of being attacked by lions and of their livestock being killed by lions. In most cases, this has not been a large problem. Lions have historically coexisted with the Masai and their cows in east Africa. When the prey base is plentiful, lions do not typically attack cattle. Also, if a lion sees a human on foot, it will typically run in the opposite direction. (Eltringham, 1979; Packer and Pusey, 2001) There have been well-publicized attacks on humans by lions, such as the man-eating lions of Tsavo (killed 135 construction workers) portrayed in the 1996 movie The Ghost and the Darkness. As lions lose habitat, they are more frequently entering human inhabited areas, thus creating more conflict and potential for \"problem lions\" that attack humans. (Dudley, 2002; Pickrell, 2004) Lions are frequently infected with FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) which is similar to HIV. In Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Crater, and Kruger National Park of South Africa, 92% of lions tested had FIV. FIV does not seem to adversely affect lions but it will kill domestic cats.

About 2,500 live in Washington state, double the populations of the early 1980s, and their numbers are growing. What they look like: Cougars are carnivores (meat eating animals). They are very good at hiding and are rarely seen in the wild. Cougars are mammals and the young drink their mother's milk. This animal is identified by its large size, cat-like appearance, uniformly gray to reddish-tan body color, and long tail - nearly three feet (1 m) long and a third of its total length. The muzzle and chest are white and there are black markings on the face, ears and tip of the tail. Cougar kittens have black spots until they are about 6 months old. Adult males weigh up to 200 pounds (about the weight of an adult man), and adult females up to 120 pounds.\nWhere they live: Other than humans, cougars are the most widely distributed land mammal in the Western Hemisphere. Cougars range from northwestern Canada to Patagonia, South America. Click on a range map to see where cougars live in Washington and California. Cougars make their dens in rocky ledges, dense thickets and under uprooted trees. They are highly territorial\u2014 a male cougar may use a home range of 50 to 150 square miles (for comparison, the City of Seattle is 92 square miles). What they eat: Cougars hunt primarily from dusk till dawn (sunset to sunrise). Their primary prey is deer, but they also eat porcupines, raccoons, birds, small mammals, foxes, mice, and grass. After the cougar is finished feeding on prey, it will cover the carcass (dead animal) with leaves and sticks to save it for another day. How they develop: Cougars begin breeding at about 3 years of age. Typical litters have 1 to 6 kittens born after a 3-month pregnancy (people have a 9-month pregnancy). Their eyes open in 8 or 9 days and the young are weaned from the mother in 2 to 3 months. The kittens may remain with the mother into their second year. How long they live: Cougars live about 10 to 20 years in the wild and over 20 years in captivity.

There are five living genera of sea lion and they can be found in the coastal waters in all of the world\u2019s oceans at subarctic to tropical latitudes.\nDescription\nSea lions are large and streamlined with a smooth appearance and short, thick hair. They have large front flippers and a tail fin that allows them to swim proficiently. They are also able to walk while on land, although they are not nearly as graceful out of the water as they are in the water. Male sea lions can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lb) and grow to 8 ft (2.4 m) long, depending on the species. Females are generally smaller, normally weighing 100-200 lb (45-90 kg).\nThere are various species of sea lion belonging to five extant genera. The largest species is the Steller\u2019s sea lion, which can weigh up to 2 200 lb (1 000 kg) and grow to a length of 10 ft (3.0 m). They are related to walruses and seals, but lack the long tusks of walruses and retain the ability to \u2018walk\u2019, unlike seals. Together with fur seals, they form the family known as Otariidae or eared seals, in reference to their characteristic external ear flaps.\nDistribution and Range\nWith various species among five genera, sea lions can be found in most of the world\u2019s oceans in all subarctic to tropical waters in both hemispheres. California sea lions and Steller sea lions are common along the west coast of North America, while the Galapagos sea lion is native to the coastal areas of northern South America near Ecuador. South America also hosts the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens), which lives primarily along the Chilean coast, while New Zealand and Australia each have distinct species of sea lions along their shores.\nAll sea lions inhabit coastal waters, generally remaining close to known \u2018haul-out spots\u2019, locations where they will exit the water and rest on the rocky shores. These haul-out spots may be small, rocky islands or remote shorelines. Sea lions are often seen lounging on man-made structures such as navigation aids and docks. When in the water, sea lions are adept swimmers, playing and hunting with speed and grace. They are capable of diving to great depths of up to 900 ft (272 m) thanks to special adaptations and the ability to remain underwater for minutes at a time.\nDiet and Predators\nSea lions are carnivorous and are voracious predators. Depending on the species and the region, they will eat a variety of items including large fish species such as salmon and tuna. Where they both occur, sea lions will also feed on penguins. Some species have also been observed feeding on young seal pups. They also eat squid, various crustaceans and mollusks, small shark species, and octopus.\nDespite being larger than many species and a fierce predator itself, sea lions have other more formidable predatory species to worry about as well. Orcas are apex predators in the ocean and almost any animal can fall victim to them, including sea lions. Pups in particular are prone to predation and orcas have been known to identify sea lion breeding grounds, often engaging in fascinating hunting activities to catch one. In New Zealand, for example, whales risk beaching themselves while rushing up on the shore in chase of young sea lions swimming and playing in the surf zone. Large sharks such as the great white shark will also hunt sea lions, pups in particular.\nReproduction\nReproductive behaviors vary somewhat between species of sea lions. However, many features are common to most species. Adult males generally try to establish a territory in the spring. Later, the female will arrive in the area as if to assess the territories available. During this time, infighting between males will increase significantly, with vicious fights and aggressive displays occurring in defense of their territories.\nFollowing copulation, females will often delay fertilization for up to three months, sometime mating with other males later in the breeding season instead. The gestation period is normally about 9 months, at which point one pup is born to each female although twins do rarely occur. In many species, females will mate again within weeks of giving birth while continuing to care for her new pup, beginning the annual cycle anew.\nSea lions reach sexual maturity at about 5-7 years of age and can live for up to 30 years. Currently, three species are listed as endangered while the rest are not currently threatened. However, as global climate change causes drastic changes in marine habitats around the world, certain populations are indeed under pressure.\nFun Facts about Sea Lion!\nSea lions are ubiquitous throughout the world and commonly observed by humans in bays, harbors, or at the zoo. They are highly intelligent and, in captivity, have been trained to perform many entertaining tricks. However, some of the most fascinating aspects of these charismatic species are better observed in the wild.\nThe Lion of the Sea\nPerhaps fitting with their common name as the lions of the sea, sea lions are voracious predators and have seemingly insatiable appetites. They will often feed in groups and effectively gorge themselves before hauling out of the water onto a rocky shoreline to digest and rest. Sea lions are known to eat up to 8% of their body weight at a time. For a 180 lb human, this is the equivalent of eating 14.4 lb (6.5 kg) of food in a single meal. Sea lions can eat prey larger than their head, such as the large Pacific octopus, all at once. There have also been accounts of steller sea lions catching sharks and consuming the pups of northern fur seals. It seems the sea lion indeed has been aptly named.\nSea Shepherd\nSea lions are known to have many adaptive behaviors and interesting hunting and feeding strategies. Most are unique to their habitat and the prey available in it. For example, the Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaek) has been demonstrated to engage in interesting herding behavior while hunting. As a group, the sea lions will herd tuna into shallow lagoons where they will be much easier to hunt. Tuna are large and powerful predators themselves, yet the sea lions seem to have found a safe way to hunt them using their numbers and intelligence to their advantage.\nSCUBA Sea Lion\nSea lions are capable of diving to deep depths in search of food. At depth, the pressure from water increases. This presents a risk due to the potential buildup of nitrogen gas in the tissues of animals, a phenomenon well-known to SCUBA divers. Many marine animals have special adaptations that allow them to inhabit these environments. While humans must return from depth slowly to allow the gases to escape their system at a reasonable rate, sea lions have specially adapted lungs that allow them to prevent the exchange of gases in their system while they are underwater.\nThis adaptation allows them to move up and down in the water column quickly in search of prey without risk of dangerous gas buildup in their circulatory system. However, this also requires their muscles to be fully loaded with oxygen prior to diving, as the air in their lungs is entirely expelled before diving, another necessity for this unique adaptation to remain effective."}

In this article, we will emphasize the distinction between Bobcat vs mountain lion.\nScientific Classification of Cougar and Bobcat:\nSpecification Bobcat Cougar Kingdom Animalia Animalia Phylum Chordata Chordata Class Mammalia Mammalia Order Carnivora Carnivora Family Felidae Falidae Scientific Name Lynx Rufus Puma Concolor Classification\nDifference Between Bobcats and Mountain Lions:\nIs a Bobcat a Mountain Lion?\nA bobcat is a medium-sized wildcat, measuring about double the size of domestic cats. It is found in a variety of habitats across the southern half of North America. They are widespread and adaptable predators that are strictly related to the northern dwelling Canadian Lynx.\nAlso read difference between a pigeon and a dove.\nFacts About Bobcat:\nBobcats are solitary animals, and they are also considered good swimmers and tree climbers.\nBut the Bobcats don\u2019t spend much time in trees.\nUsually, the Bobcats prefer to rest on rocky ledges in a thicket during the day time.\nBobcats have a short bobtail, which is about five inches long.\nMost importantly, Bobcats have tufted ears, and it has hair that sticks on the top of the ear.\nUsually, bobcats have an orange color and some black spots on their bodies.\n13 sub-species of bobcats have been recognized.\nBobcats are highly terrestrial and mark their area from their urine and feces.\nBobcats are excellent climbers to catch a low flying bird and swimmers, and also have good vision, hearing and sense of smell.\nBobcats sleep in hidden dens, which can be a hollow tree, caves, or rocky gaps.\nBobcats can run up to 30 miles per hour, and they put their back feet on the same spot of the front feet to reduce the sound when hunting.\nBobcats mate primarily in winters, the mating can take place from November until August.\nAfter the evolution of 60 to 70 days, the female bobcat usually delivers two to four kittens.\nThe predators of the kittens are eagles, owl, bears, foxes, and coyotes.\nFacts About Cougar: Mountain Lion\nCougar is the second largest cat species of North America; cougars are also known as mountain lions.\nThe coats of cougar vary from greyish tan to reddish hue; the tail is black and has black spots on its ear and face.\nCougars have rounded heads, pointed ears, and slim body.\nThe hinds of cougars are strong, and they also have more giant paws that enable them to curl around and snatch at its prey.\nAs cougars are ambush hunters, they hide behind rocks or hills waiting for their victims.\nCougars are most active during the dawn and the dusk.\nCougars are excellent swimmers but have a poor sense of smell.\nCougars are solitary animals; the only female cougar can be seen in a group with her cubs.\nAn adult cougar can be seen in a group while mating.\nThe female cougar will deliver one to six or usually three to four cubs after the gestation of 3 months.\nBaby cubs are born blind and deaf; after two weeks, they can open their eyes.\nThe cubs have spotted bodies which help them blend with grass, bush, mottled sunlight, and protect them from their predators.\nAlso read alligator versus a crocodile fight comparison.\nBobcat Habitat:\nThe habitat of a bobcat ranges from swamps, desert fringes, and forests. The majority of the bobcats are found in the United States, but they range from Mexico to Southern Canada. Bobcats are also referred to as wildcats. They are twice as big as an average housecat.\nCougar Habitat:\nThe geographic range of the cougar is the greatest of any wild terrestrial animal in the western hemisphere, from Canadian Yukon through central and South America to the southern tip of Chile.\nBobcat vs Mountain Lions Tracks:\nIf you can identify animal tracks, you can keep yourself safe while walking in nature. The first thing you want to be able to determine is whether or not the print is feline or canine. Feline prints are easy to distinguish because unlike canine prints, they do not have claws, cats keep their retracted while they walk. You can also determine a feline print because the pad is shaped like the letter \u2018M,\u2019 the pad has two lobes on the top and three on the bottom.\nCougar Tracks:\nCougar footprints are easily distinguished from bobcat print because they are large, measuring up to 4 inches wide and 3 and 1/3 inches long.\nMountain Lion Tracks:\nBobcat prints are about double the size of the domestic cat, but about half the size of a cougar\u2019s footprints. The bobcat print measures about 1 and 3/8 inches wide by one and \u00bd inches long.\nThe Bobcat vs Mountain Lion Sounds:\nCougars are also unable to roar as both the species don\u2019t have the needed larynx. They also communicate using hisses, purr, growls, and screams.\nMountain lion communicates through scents, visual signals, and vocalization. The vocalization made by bobcats includes meows, hisses, yowls, growls, and screams.\nBobcat Versus Mountain Lion: Who Would Win?\nOne can quickly identify cougars and bobcats by their size because mountain lions are considered large cats. It is 5 to 6 feet in body length, and the average weight is around 135 pounds to 180 pounds. In general, bobcats are mid-sized cats that measure only approximately 2 to 3.5 feet and weigh about 40 pounds. Usually, a fight between bobcat and cougar will be rare to see. With aggressive behavior, a mountain lion will beat any other animal quickly.\nAlso read puma vs cougar full fight comparsion."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "21 Fun Facts about Black Panther the Animal", "url": "https://beyondthepitch.net/facts-about-black-panther/", "text": "21 Fun Facts about Black Panther the Animal\nFacts abaout Black Panther \u2013 Black panther is a name that many remember; it even became a name of a popular movie. However, in actuality, black panther is very rare to be found.\nThere are a lot of amazing facts about black panther that will amuse you, and we have 21 of those facts listed below!\nBlack panther is either a leopard or a jaguar depending on where it is found. Sometimes, it is even used to describe any other dark-colored cats. Basically, the name refers to any black-furred leopards or jaguars.\nThe black color is the result of rare mutation, which is called melanism, that increases the pigmentation of the dark color in the skin or hair of a black panther. Here are some unique facts that you should know:\nRead: Species that are endangered\n21 Fun Facts about Black Panther the Animal\n1. Holds The Scientific Name Of Panthera Pardus\nRelated to the Felidae family, black panthers are included in the member of the cats. Panthers that are from jaguar species are from Panthera orca.\nThe number one facts about black panther is that normal jaguars can only have regular spotted cubs, but black jaguars can either have the spotted or completely black cubs.\n2. Black Panthers Are Also Called Leopards And Jaguars\nDepending on where it is located, black panthers are black furred leopards and jaguars. Black leopards are referred to as black panthers in Asia and Africa, while in Latin America, jaguars are also called black panthers. In North America, it is the name of a black cougar.\nIn fact, the name \u201cpanther\u201d is used to refer to other big cats as well. Even tigers, lynx, bobcats and other cats that are black-colored are often referred to as black panthers.\n3. The Fifth Largest Species Of Big Cats\nBig cats include leopard, jaguar, tiger, lion and snow leopard. They are all have enormous size; therefore, they are classified into big cats. The black panthers that are known currently hold the position of the fifth largest species of big cats.\nCurrently, the species of big cats that are living right now are the big cats we have said, along with Caracal, Lynx, Serval, Indian Bengal Tiger and several other wild big cats.\n4. The Population Of Black Panther Is Almost Unidentified\nAs panthers are not the name of a specific animal, we are unable to identify the exact numbers of panthers in the world. Leopards and jaguars are also a secretive animal, in which they mostly hide and steer clear of dangerous opponents, such as humans.\nBut, there are only around 250,000 of them can be found in the world right now. Because black panthers are basically the panthers with pigmentation mutation, they are rarely found. However, black panthers are used as mascots by the soldiers of United States.\n5. Has A Pigmentation Mutation Called Melanism\nMelanism is a pigmentation mutation that turns the skin and hair of an animal into black. It comes out as a form of adaptation, in which an animal could survive better in the wild due to the black furs. To black panthers, this mutation is very beneficial especially when it comes to night-hunting.\nThis mutation doesn\u2019t only happen to black panthers alone. A number of animals, such as squirrel, guinea pigs, and roosters can also have a melanism.\n6. Panthers First Evolved In Eurasia\nThe ancestors of big cats separated a very long time ago. Their splits led to different evolutions among the big cats. The oldest fossil of big cats to be found was from Africa and aged around 3.8 million years old.\nAs for panthers, the fossil record shows that the first evolution started in Eurasia. This happened during the ice ages where they spread across Eurasia.\n7. National Animal Of Gabon\nAs it was found in Africa, Gabon, a country in Central Africa, has named black panthers as their national animal. Black panther is chosen as the national animal because it is rare, fearless, intelligent as well as powerful.\nA black panther is able to roar as the fangs are properly developed and could bite any victim to death in a single take.\n8. Black Panthers Are Great Swimmers And Climbers\nThis strong big cat is known to be an amazing swimmer and climber. Black panthers love to dive in the water as a form of relaxing. They could also climb up to 20 feet, making them very powerful to catch any prey on a tree.\nBlack panther is made to be excellent at hunting, equipped with excellent sense of hearing, eyesight and jumping ability.\n9. Developed To Be Excellent Hunters\nAlong with amazing hearing and eyesight, panthers are also equipped with large and strong paws. Supported with the sharp claws, panthers are excellent at hunting the preys.\nThe ways of hunting are not different with common big cats. They use element of surprise to catch the other animals, hiding in the bush and attacking the prey with a suffocating neck bite.\n10. Relies On Stealth When Hunting For Foods\nPanthers are carnivores, therefore they have to catch their living foods. So, they need to be fast to catch them. However, they won\u2019t rely on speed to do this because big cats lack in stamina.\nIntensive running will make them get tired and hungry easily due to over-heating. Instead of relying on speed, they will hide behind the bush, trees and across ledges. Then, they will catch the preys by surprise.\nIn order to hunt for food, panthers use their best strength: to be unpredictable and aggressive. This is why they are often referred to as the ghost of the forest, especially black panther, which has dark coat that helps them hide and stalk the preys even better during the night.\n11. Weight Up To 96 Kilograms And Range In Length Up To 2 Meters\nAn adult leopard can grow as tall as 90 to 160 cm with the mass of 31 kg. Adult jaguar can grow even bigger, with the length of 1.2 to 2 m and weigh around 56 to 96 kg.\nThis doesn\u2019t include the tails, which can range around 500 cm to 1 m long. These are the approximate weight and length of an adult, male panthers. As for the females, they are usually about a half or two-thirds of their size.\n12. Panthers Can Roar\nAlong with the other big cats, namely lion, tiger, leopard and jaguar, panthers can roar loudly. This is due to their voice box where one of the bones is replaced with ligament.\nThe ligament can be stretched and giving them a wider range of pitch, therefore letting them roar loudly. The more the ligament is extended, the deeper the sound that panthers produce. This is because their cords are large and fleshy.\n13. Panthers Are Solitary Animals\nOther facts about black panther are that they don\u2019t spend their times interacting with other animals. Instead, they are often alone while hunting for foods as well as traveling.\nThis is why panthers are called solitary animals, which are the opposite of social animals. Panthers don\u2019t even spend much time with the other panthers, except during the mating season as well as raising their children.\n14. Panthers Only Meet During Mating Seasons\nWhen panthers are ready to mate, the female panthers will leave a mark of scents so that the male panthers can follow it. In addition to that, they also make a sound to attract the male panthers. This is a competition among the male panthers to mate.\nPanthers are ready to mate around 2 years old, but due to the competition, male panthers may get the opportunity to mate when they are 2 to 4 years old. After they mate, the male and female panthers won\u2019t spend much time together anymore.\n15. The Gestation Period Is Around 3 To 4 Months\nThe female panthers will take care of the children by themselves after having them around 3-4 months. Each pregnancy will create 2 to 4 cubs, who will stay with the mothers for 2 years before traveling on their own.\nThey learn quickly, so only a couple of months after being born, they can already help their mother hunt. Even though they are black, black panthers may give birth to spotted cubs too.\n16. The Eyes Of The Cubs Are Covered With Light Fur\nWhen they are still newly born, the cubs\u2019 eyes are covered with light fur. This makes the cubs blind for the first two weeks of their lives. They are small and vulnerable, in which the mother plays a big role in protecting the den. However, the mother still needs to go out to hunt, so they are prone to attacks during this time.\nThe cubs could accompany their mother after a couple of months. It only takes around 2 to 3 months for the young panthers to learn hunting. After nine months, they can even bring down medium-sized preys.\n17. Can Live Up To 15 Years And In Captivity Up To 20\nOne of the facts about black panther is how they can live for a long time. They will hold their moves or even disappear when humans are nearby.\nThey have become used to the noises that human makes and are able to distinguish them to their preys. As a result, panthers can live from 12 to 15 years in the wild.\n18. The Speed Is Up To 58 Kilometers Per Hour\nAlthough their method of hunting is to creep up the preys as close as possible and make a sudden attack, they are actually incredibly quick. But, not so quick like cheetah which is the fastest animal in the world. Panthers can move and run up to 58 km per hour, but not for a long run.\nThey are low in stamina so they don\u2019t use their speed for running; instead, the speed is used to keep up with the fast prey such as antelope and deer. Combining both ways, they like to stay close without the prey knowing and then catch them in a short spring attack.\n19. The Fur Of Black Panther Is A Mix Of Colors\nEven though the fur of black panther looks black, it actually is the combination of dark blue, black, grey and purple. In fact, in the mythologies of European, panther was said to be a multi-colored beast. In the myth, panthers like to have a feast by hunting many creatures and sleep in the cave for three days afterwards.\nThe sign of the beast awaken is the sweet-smelling yet deadly breath that could be noticed by all nearby creatures, except the dragon.\n20. Australian Panthers\nAustralian panthers are one of the species of black panthers. They are responsible for the disappearance of several animals in rural Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia. In fact, the story of black panthers has been around as a tale in Australia.\nIt becomes a conspiracy theory yet a lot of sightings keep being reported. The black big cats have been spotted by a lot of people across the country. Some also found the scratch on the trees that are speculated to belong to the black panther.\n21. Able To Survive In Populated Areas With Humans\nPanthers are believed to have a better survival ability when are faced with humans, compared to the other big cats. However, panthers still need large wilderness areas to live and survive.\nThis is due to them being hunted by humans for the past centuries. The population of panthers have been declined, both leopards and jaguars. This is because the habitat of those big cats have been degrading, making the panthers even rarer than they already were.\nThey can still be tracked from the marks left on the ground or trees, but because they are so sneaky, it is quite hard to witness them even in the wilderness.\nPanthers are not considered to be a specific species and the name is often used to refer to several big cats, especially leopards and jaguars. Nonetheless, the population of these big cats have been decreasing as they are becoming more and more vulnerable.\nTheir natural range and habitat has been degrading, and even with their amazing ability to survive, their number one enemy is human that catches them for personal reasons, such as for trophy and the fur.\nBlack panther is even rarer than the regular panthers. Despite all the amazing facts about black panther that prove that they are strong, they are still considered to be endangered in the end and may soon be included among animals that are extinct."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Steller Sea Lion | NOAA Fisheries", "url": "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/steller-sea-lion", "text": "Steller sea lion - Photo: NOAA Fisheries\nAbout the Species\nThe Steller (or northern) sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) is the largest member of the family Otariidae, the \u201ceared seals,\u201d which includes all sea lions and fur seals. Steller sea lions are named for Georg Wilhelm Steller, the German surgeon and naturalist on the Bering expedition who first described and wrote about the species in 1742. While they are the only living member of their genus, they share parts of their range with a smaller related species, California sea lions. Steller sea lions' impressive low-frequency vocalizations sound more like roars than California sea lions\u2019 barks. They also share parts of their range with another otariid: northern fur seal. Historically, Steller sea lions were highly abundant throughout many parts of the coastal North Pacific Ocean. Indigenous peoples and settlers hunted them for their meat, hides, oil, and other products, and today sea lions are an important subsistence resource for Alaska Natives. Because of unexplained widespread population declines in Alaska, Steller sea lions were first listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1990. In 1997 NOAA Fisheries recognized two distinct population segments, listing the eastern distinct population segment (DPS) as threatened and the western DPS as endangered. The eastern DPS has since recovered and is no longer listed, which is a significant achievement under the ESA. The western DPS remains endangered. Learn more about the eastern and western populations of Steller sea lions\nPopulation Status\nThe two populations of Steller sea lions differ genetically and morphologically, and have contrasting population trends. Population status and trends are reported in our stock assessment reports.\nThe western DPS includes all Steller sea lions originating from rookeries west of Cape Suckling (144\u00b0 west longitude). Their population has decreased approximately 77 to 81 percent from the 1970s to the early 2000s. While the western DPS has been increasing slowly overall since 2003, there are strong regional differences across the range in Alaska and the population continues to decline in the central and western Aleutian Islands. The North Pacific Ocean marine heatwave of 2014 - 2016 was associated with a decline of pup productivity between 2015 and 2017 in the eastern and central Gulf of Alaska, a decline in adult female survival in the eastern Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska, and Southeast Alaska, and with a subsequent decline in non-pup abundance throughout the Gulf of Alaska in 2019, contrasting with a previously increasing trend until 2017.\nThe eastern DPS includes Steller sea lions originating from rookeries east of Cape Suckling. The eastern stock increased at a rate of 4.25 percent per year (95 percent credible intervals of 3.77-4.72 percent) between 1987 and 2017, based on an analysis of pup counts in California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Southeast Alaska.\nPopulation trends for the eastern and western DPSs differ for complex reasons; most simply, the difference likely results from the different kinds and magnitudes of threats the species faces throughout its range.\nLearn more about the eastern and western DPSs\nProtected Status\nESA Endangered 1 distinct population segment Western DPS ESA Delisted 1 distinct population segment Eastern DPS MMPA Protected Throughout Its Range MMPA Depleted 1 stock Western DPS MMPA Strategic 1 stock Western DPS\nAppearance\nSteller sea lions are sexually dimorphic\u2014adult males are much larger than females. Adult males may be up to 11 feet long and can weigh up to 2,500 pounds. Adult females are 7.5 to 9.5 feet long and weigh up to 800 pounds. Adult males are further distinguished by long, coarse hair on the chest, shoulders, and back. An adult male\u2019s chest and neck are also more massive and muscular than a female\u2019s. Both adult males and females have light blonde to reddish brown coats that are slightly darker on the chest and abdomen. The light coloration is still visible when the body is wet. Like other pinnipeds, they molt, or shed their fur, every year. Both sexes have long light-colored whiskers (vibrissae) on their muzzles, which they use to sense prey and feel their way underwater. The flippers and other hairless parts of the skin are black. On land, sea lions, unlike \"true\" seals, can turn their hind flippers forward for walking. They can climb and are sometimes found on rocks or cliff faces high above the water. When they swim, Steller sea lions use their broad, long front flippers to propel themselves and are highly maneuverable.\nBehavior and Diet\nSteller sea lions are predatory and consume a wide range of prey, foraging and feeding primarily at night on over a hundred species of fish (including Atka mackerel, walleye pollock, salmon, Pacific cod, Pacific sand lance, arrowtooth flounder, Irish lords, rock sole, capelin, eulachon, Pacific sandfish, Pacific herring, rockfish, smooth lumpsucker, and Pacific hake) and cephalopods (including squid and octopus). Their diet varies in different parts of their range and at different times of the year, depending on the abundance and distribution of prey species. To meet their energy requirements to grow, survive, and reproduce, Steller sea lions likely depend on predictable prey that are readily available and sufficiently abundant so that they may forage efficiently throughout the stages of their lives and during different times of the year. Steller sea lions forage near and off shore, and in both benthic and pelagic zones. Different individuals may have different foraging strategies. For example, NOAA Fisheries\u2019 research shows that in the non-breeding season, some adult females may spend long periods of time foraging well off the continental shelf while others forage much nearer to terrestrial sites. During the breeding season, a female must forage close enough to her rookery to return often and nurse her young, and her foraging range and trip duration will expand greatly as the pup grows. An adult female has very high energy demands\u2014especially in the winter, when she must find enough food to feed herself and nurse her pup, possibly while pregnant with the next year\u2019s pup. Steller sea lions, especially males, can travel long distances in a season. Diving ability changes with age. The deepest dive documented is about 1,400 feet in depth. Steller sea lions need undisturbed land habitat to rest, molt, socialize, mate, give birth, and nurse small pups during the breeding season. They are highly social and may rest in large groups, overlapping their bodies. At sea, they can be seen alone or in small groups, and sometimes gather in large \"rafts\" at the surface near areas of large prey aggregations. While at sea, they can sometimes be seen holding one or more flippers out of the water to thermoregulate. Flippers are a poorly insulated part of the body because the blood vessels are close to the surface of the skin. When floating on the surface of the water, sea lions can extend their flippers into the air to absorb heat, which is then circulated to the rest of the body, including areas near important seasonal prey resources.\nWhere They Live\nSteller sea lions inhabit the colder temperate to subarctic waters of the North Pacific Ocean. They need both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. They mate and give birth on land, at traditional sites called rookeries. Typically, sea lions come back to mate on their natal rookery site, each year. Sites where animals haul-out to rest, where breeding does not occur, are referred to as haulouts. Haulout and rookery sites usually consist of beaches (gravel, rocky, or sand), ledges, and rocky reefs. In the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea, sea lions may also haul-out on sea ice. Steller sea lions are distributed mainly around the coasts along the North Pacific Ocean rim from northern Hokkaido, Japan through the Kuril Islands and Sea of Okhotsk, the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, the southern coast of Alaska, and south to central California. While they are most typically found in coastal waters on the continental shelf, they also occur and sometimes forage in much deeper continental slope and pelagic waters, especially in the non-breeding season. The western DPS includes Steller sea lions that originate from rookeries west of 144\u00b0 west longitude (Cape Suckling): those in the Gulf of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, the Bering Sea, and Asia. The eastern DPS includes sea lions originating from rookeries in southeast Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. Data show that the foraging ranges of the two DPSs overlap, especially in the non-breeding season. For example, females from the eastern Gulf of Alaska regularly occur in parts of southeast Alaska and males from the eastern DPS have been observed as far north as the Bering Sea. In recent years, a \u201cmixing zone\u201d has also become established in northern southeast Alaska on at least two new rookeries partially established by western DPS females. Learn more about the eastern and western populations of Steller sea lions\nWorld map providing approximate representation of the Steller sea lion's range.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nSteller sea lions are colonial breeders. They have a polygynous mating system, in which only a small proportion of the sexually mature males father most of the pups in a given season. Adult males, also known as bulls, arrive early on rookeries to establish breeding territories that they defend through the breeding season. Bulls become sexually mature between 3 and 8 years of age, but typically are not large enough to hold territory successfully until 9 or 10 years old. A mature male may go without eating for 1 to 2 months while he defends his territory. Not all males will successfully hold a breeding territory for one or more breeding seasons. Females begin to arrive on rookeries in mid-May. Females typically give birth to their first pup between 4 to 6 years of age, usually giving birth to a single pup each year. However, they may not pup every year. Pupping occurs from about mid-May to mid-July and peaks in June. Females usually mate within 2 weeks after giving birth. Steller sea lions are mammals; adult females, also known as cows, stay with their pups for a few days after birth before beginning a regular routine of foraging at sea, nursing pups on land, then going back to forage. Female Steller sea lions use smell and distinct vocalizations to recognize and create strong social bonds with their newborn pups. While most pups likely wean before their first birthdays, some pups are nursed for as long as three years. At birth, pups are about 3 feet in length and weigh 35 to 50 pounds. Pups have a thick, dark brown to black \"lanugo\" coat until 4 to 6 months old, when they molt to a lighter brown. By the end of their second year, pups are the same color as adults. Males can live to be up to 20 years old, while females can live to be approximately 30 years old.\nThreats\nSteller sea lions are exposed to a variety of human-caused and natural threats. Some of the most pressing threats are discussed below. Effects of Fisheries on Prey Cumulative and annual commercial fishery removals may result in temporal and seasonal changes in distribution and abundance of primary prey, prey reduction, and changes in prey size; they may also cause ecosystem effects. All of these may affect Steller sea lions' ability to reliably access sufficient prey to sustain the health, reproduction, and survival of individuals and support sustained increase and eventual recovery of the population. Climate Change Global climate change is expected to have profound impacts on arctic and sub-arctic marine ecosystems. This may affect the composition, spatial and temporal distribution, and abundance of prey available to Steller sea lions. Sea Level Rise Sea level rise caused by climate change will directly affect terrestrial rookery and haulout sites currently used by Steller sea lions as well as those that may be used by a recovering population. This may result in more deaths among small pups, and traditional sites on some islands with low relief may be submerged. Temperature Changes Decadal scale regime shifts, and shorter-term oceanographic anomalies such as El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and marine heatwaves, also can have large effects on distribution and abundance of Steller sea lion prey. Marine heatwaves have already shown to reduce Steller sea lion survival. Ocean Acidification Ocean acidification effects on Steller sea lions are uncertain but are likely to include serious impacts on ecosystems and may have adverse effects on specific species prey through food web effects. Harmful Algal Blooms Harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins cause sickness and death in humans and Steller sea lions. Warming water temperatures increases toxic algae growth, prevents water from mixing, allowing algae to grow thicker and faster, and algal blooms absorb sunlight, making water even warmer and promoting more blooms. Disease and Parasites Steller sea lions are exposed to a variety of diseases and parasites. Adult females and pups are likely the age-classes most vulnerable to disease and parasitism. Infectious disease and parasitism likely have a relatively low impact on the recovery of the Steller sea lion's western distinct population segment. However, climate-change-related shifts in distribution of other species may expose Steller sea lions to novel disease vectors or parasites that could have large-scale impacts. NOAA Fisheries works with a variety of scientists and veterinarians to monitor disease in animals that are found dead and to sample live animals. Toxic Substances Contaminants that might harm Steller sea lions can occur naturally in the environment and enter ocean waters from many sources, such as oil and gas activity (tankering and pipeline transport, production, etc.), vessel accidents and sinkings (leading to loss of cargo, fuel, etc.), local industrial development, atmospheric transport, wastewater discharges, at-sea processing, runoff, toxic waste sites, nuclear testing, industrial accidents, and natural sources. Once in the environment, some contaminants move up the food chain and accumulate in top predators. Certain pollutants that Steller sea lions are exposed to have been shown to damage the immune and reproductive systems of other mammals and to negatively impact their health and survival. Of particular concern now is information showing that mercury contaminant loads of some western DPS Steller sea lion pups are relatively high in some parts of the range where declines are still occurring. Exposure to organochlorines known to affect health impacts in other species have been found in parts of the western and eastern DPSs, though impacts on Steller sea lions are not clear. Emerging environmental contaminants, such as Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are known to bioaccumulate in marine mammals and thus are also a concern, though Steller sea lion exposure to these compounds is not well understood. Human-Caused Injuries and Mortality Steller sea lions may be disturbed by humans in vessels (power, kayak, etc.), manned and unmanned (e.g. drone) aircraft, and on land. When disturbed, Steller sea lions may stampede into the water, which can injure or kill pups and juveniles when they are crushed by adults, and in extreme cases cause pup abandonment. Steller sea lions that are illegally fed can cause them to become habituated, aggressive, lead to more fisheries interactions, entanglements, and illegal shootings as a result of increased frustrations. Interactions with Active Fishing Gear Historically, commercial fishing in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean incidentally killed many Steller sea lions. Changes in fishing techniques and areas and times fished are thought to have significantly reduced incidental take. Amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1988 and 1994 required observer programs to monitor marine mammal incidental take in some domestic fisheries and NOAA Fisheries provides estimates of mortality and serious injury of Steller sea lions due to US commercial fisheries in marine mammal stock assessments for the western and eastern DPSs. These estimates are likely an underestimate of the actual levels, since large segments of the fishing industry, (including fisheries near Steller sea lion rookeries, haulouts, and feeding areas, and fisheries with known past interaction with sea lions) have either no or very limited observer coverage. Thus, we are highly uncertain about the impact of this threat. Disturbance Steller sea lions may be disturbed by vessels (power boats, kayaks, paddleboards, etc.) approaching from the water, by manned and unmanned (e.g., drones) aircraft, and by approach from the land. Disturbance to Steller sea lions on terrestrial haulout sites can lead to individuals fleeing toward the water, causing mass stampedes during which pups and juveniles may be injured or killed when crushed by adults. Disturbance can also cause sea lions to flee from the tops of steep rocks or cliff faces, also causing injury or death. Disturbance can lead to interruption of important behaviors such as nursing, resting, breeding, and socializing. Repeated disturbances that cause lactating females to abandon rookeries or use them less often could impact the health and survival of pups by reducing normal nursing cycles. Steller sea lion feeding can also be disturbed by vessel traffic or underwater noise Entanglement Entanglement in marine debris and/or ingestion of fishing gear is known to contribute to Steller sea lion injury and mortality. Steller sea lions can become entangled in marine debris or fishing gear, either swimming off with the gear attached or becoming anchored. Once entangled, sea lions may drag and swim with attached gear for long distances, ultimately suffering fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or severe injury that may lead to reduced reproductive success and death. Available data indicate that the incidence of entanglement is greater in Southeast Alaska than in areas west of 144\u00b0 west longitude. Entanglement rates to the west however are likely underestimated due to fewer observations in a less-populated area. Not all entangled animals strand (e.g., they may drown) and not all stranded animals are found or reported. This is true especially in the most remote parts of the range of this species. Illegal Feeding Feeding of sea lions is illegal and can lead to close interactions between humans and sea lions that pose risks to both. Feeding-related problems include changes in sea lion behavior; habituation; aggression toward humans; negative impacts to fisheries; and entanglement, injury, and death of animals.

Illegal Shooting It is illegal to shoot Steller sea lions unless you are an Alaska Native and the take is for subsistence purposes (food or handicraft) and is not accomplished in a wasteful manner. Historical accounts, especially associated with fisheries, documented substantial mortality to the western DPS due to illegal shooting. While there is likely much less illegal shooting than during the period of sharp decline in the 1970s and 1980s, documented illegal shooting of sea lions in the Copper River Delta area, as well as fishermen\u2019s reports of greater interactions with fisheries are cause for concern. Subsistence use stuck and lost Steller sea lion carcasses further complicate efforts to estimate illegal shooting. Most parts of the range of the western DPS are not systematically monitored for carcasses, so there are no current studies evaluating levels of illegal shooting; large parts of the fishing industry, including fisheries near Steller sea lion rookeries, haulouts, and feeding areas, have either no or very limited observer coverage. Vessel Strikes Inadvertent vessel strikes can injure or kill Steller sea lions. There have been four documented cases of Steller sea lions being injured or killed due to nearshore vessel strikes in Alaska since 2007 (PDF: see Table 10). Nearshore vessel strikes are most likely to occur in areas where Steller sea lions are concentrated for feeding or rafting, or near large haulouts or rookeries from which large numbers of animals will be in transit. Predation The primary predators of Steller sea lions are killer whales, sharks, and humans.\nScientific Classification"}

While they\u2019re obligate carnivorous like all other felines, the exact specifics of their diets often are known \u2013 things like how much they eat or the exact animals they prefer. In the article below, we\u2019ll answer questions about what mountain lions eat as well as many more!\nHow Much Do Mountain Lions Eat?\nA mountain lion eating at a zoo Ipatov/Shutterstock.com\nIn a single meal, mountain lions can eat anywhere between 20 and 30 pounds of meat, especially if they\u2019ve recently hunted a large animal. In comparison, humans only eat around four pounds of food per day (and that\u2019s usually at the very most!)\nMountain lions aren\u2019t always eating fresh food either. While they won\u2019t scavenge like other animals might, they have been known to bury their prey and eat off the remains for nearly two weeks at a time.\nHowever, mountain lions may not be successful hunters all the time. As a result, while their primary prey is deer, they may also eat smaller meals, such as mice or rabbits.\nHow Do Mountain Lions Hunt?\nA mountain lion surveying the world Kwadrat/Shutterstock.com\nMountain lions are known as opportunistic hunters, which means that they\u2019re willing to hunt nearly anything that won\u2019t take a lot of effort.\nRather than going out of their way to track and hunt prey, mountain lions are more likely to hide in treetops or other areas with high coverage in order to ambush and kill prey with a lethal bite to the spinal cord.\nWhat Do Mountain Lions Eat?\nMountain Lion (Felis Concolor) Jumping a Canyon Christina Moraes/Shutterstock.com\nAs opportunistic hunters, mountain lions aren\u2019t likely to go out of their way when it comes to dinner. While they eat a variety of prey from small rodents to larger predators, it seems that deer, specifically mule deer, are the most common prey of most mountain lions.\nHowever, while the majority of the species favors mule deer, Santa Ana\u2019s Department of Natural Resources found out some surprising information while tracking a mountain lion named Brokenleg, which they shared in this Facebook post. Over the course of 21 months, Brokenleg consumed 35 badgers compared to only 5 mule deer and 19 elk!\nBrokenleg\u2019s full diet over the 21 months was:\n35 badgers\n19 elk\n15 coyote\n10 beaver\n6 raccoons\n5 mule deer\n4 porcupines\n2 pronghorns\n2 domestic dogs\n1 rabbit\n1 mountain sheep\nTop 20 List of Mountain Lion Prey\nHere is a list of the 20 animals that mountain lions most often eat:\nDeer\nCoyotes\nRaccoons\nElk\nFeral hogs\nPorcupines\nMice\nRabbits\nMoose\nBighorn sheep\nBeavers\nAntelope\nBadger\nBirds\nMarmots\nInsects\nFeral horses\nBlack bears\nCaribou\nSquirrels\nWill Mountain Lions Eat Larger Predators?\nMountain Lion In Snow (Felis Concolor) Unknown/Shutterstock.com\nWhile it\u2019s more common to find mountain lions making a quick meal out of deer, rabbits, and other smaller animals, they will occasionally kill and eat larger predators, such as coyotes and black bears. However, mountain lions don\u2019t usually target black bears and will only eat them in the rare occasion that a conflict breaks out, usually because the mountain lion has strayed into the bear\u2019s territory.\nAre Mountain Lions Dangerous to Humans?\nYou\u2019re more likely to have trouble with man\u2019s best friend than you are a mountain lion.\nWhile mountain lions could easily kill a human, they don\u2019t see humans as a part of the menu and aren\u2019t likely to attack unless in a dire situation. They also tend to avoid areas where humans live, making encounters unlikely.\nAs a result, while mountain lions could pose a potential threat for humans in a chance encounter, they\u2019re more often than not considered not a threat unless you tread into their territory.\nWhat Do Mountain Lion Cubs Eat?\nMountain lion cubs take about four to six months to wean Nagel Photography/Shutterstock.com\nLike all mammals, mountain lion cubs start out by eating only milk from their mother. It can take up to seven weeks for them to wean and begin eating solid food. Until they\u2019re able to hunt on their own, their mother will bring meat to the litter for them to eat.\nOnce they\u2019re fully weaned, at around four to six months old, they\u2019ll be able to start hunting their own prey, usually smaller animals like rabbits and skunks. As they mature and grow, they\u2019ll be able to hunt larger prey until they\u2019re able to easily hunt and kill deer, elk, and other common prey animals."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Top 10 Interesting Facts About Lions | TopTeny.com", "url": "https://www.topteny.com/top-10-interesting-facts-about-lions/", "text": "Lions are those animals that are accustomed to eat meat, they are fierce enough to end your life. In circus, some shows are displayed to the audiences, while many of the trainers are getting injured. Hunters and zoologists have observed some interesting facts about lions, from which we bring you the top 10 in a list.\n10 Lazy lions\nLions take pleasure in relaxing and lazing in the region they live. They spend about 16 till 20 hours each day resting as well as sleeping. They have some sweat glands so they intelligently are liable to preserve their energy by resting throughout the day and turn to be fuller of life at night when it is cooler.\n9 Lioness mothers\nLionesses are thoughtful mothers who will even look after an abandoned cub, letting him/her suckle and giving them a prospect to stay alive. Two or more lionesses in a set are liable to give birth approximately at the same time, and the cubs grow up together. Cubs are extremely good-humored.\n8 Lions conversation\nLions converse through an assortment of behaviors and their easy-to-read movements are very developed. They will act upon nonviolent tactile actions like defeating each other and rubbing heads. Head rubbing is deemed to be a commonplace greeting behavior for lions. They also talk using a variety of vocalizations such as purrs, miaws and hissing. Their vocalizations also differ in strength as well as pitch.\n7 Sphinx\nAncient Egyptians idolized lions as their war deities because of their strength, muscle and brutality. The well-known sphinxes are just one of many mythological illustrations of the lion in Egyptian civilization.\n6 Symbols of strength and courage\nLions are deemed to be symbols of power and bravery and have been rejoiced all through history for these characteristics. They are also frequent symbols for monarchs as well as grandeur, therefore the phrase of \u2018king of the jungle\u2019 is said.\n5 Roar of lions\nLions buzz quietly when pleased but can utter a forceful roar that is capable of being heard for five miles. At times they look to be lazy and tired, but they have the aptitude to move with astonishing speed. Man has immortalized the lion for its bravery, and a daring person is said to be lionhearted.\n4 Lion\u2019s meals\nAfrican lions intake great animals that they find in the grasslands, such as antelopes, zebras as well as wildebeest. Asiatic lions eat large animals as well, like goats, nilgai, chital, sambhar along with buffaloes. They are famous for eating tinier animals.\n3 African lion prides\nAfrican lion prides have up to three males, approximately a dozen females, and their young, in keeping with National Geographic. There are prides that include as many as 40 members.\n2 The cubs\nAt 3 till 4 years old, males as well as females are prepared to mate. The female has a development period of about four months. She will give birth to her babies away from others and conceal the cubs for the first six weeks of their lives. At nativity, the cubs weigh about 3 lbs. They are also totally needy on their mother.\n1 Big cats\nAfrican lions are the most communal of all big cats and exist together in groups. It is called a pride that has about 15 lions. Lions inhabiting Zoo\u2019s don\u2019t contain the pressure of protecting territories in opposition to other groups and don\u2019t include hunting for them, which could perhaps be the cause for a longer lifetime. Male lions protect the pride\u2019s country while females do most of the hunting. Notwithstanding, the males eat initially."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "+ Habitat of a Lion (Interesting Facts about Animal)", "url": "https://beyondthepitch.net/habitat-of-a-lion/", "text": "Habitat of a Lion\nWe all know that one animal that rules the jungle, that even human refers it as the king of the jungle. Yes, the majestic animal is lion. While it is still the second largest big cats in the world after tiger, it is still hugely respected as the number one in the forest. Where can you find them in the world? Let\u2019s find out the habitat of a lion.\nLions are classified into two types of species, which is the African and Asiatic lion. However, lions have also roamed through Europe as well.\nThese lions are similar genetically, but due to the difference in habitat, there are some behaviors and characteristics that are a little bit different between the African lion and the Asiatic lion.\nHabitat of a Lion\n1. Where do They Live?\nThe Asiatic lions, which mean they live in Asia, can only be found in India. The state is called Gurajat, which is in Western India, to be exact.\nThe habitat of a lion is protected under the national park for wildlife, Gir Forest National Park. There are 500 lions kept in this park, as well as leopards, deer, hyenas, foxes, reptiles, antelope, jackal and birds.\nThe African lions can be found in several places in Africa and still have their territories in open woodlands. They can be found in the jungle of Angola, Central African Republic, Botswana, South Sudan, Tanzania, Mozambique, and more in the sub-Saharan Africa. The lions are keeping their territories safe up to 260 square kilometers wide.\n2. The Prides of Lions\nMost of the big cats are solitary animals, which mean they prefer to be alone. The males usually hunt alone after they are old enough, leaving the females in charge of the family.\nThe case is different with lions, which are social and prefer to live in groups. The groups of lions are called prides, and they can be different according to each of the habitat of a lion.\nIn the form of prides on the African lions, we can find three adult male lions and around twelve of the females as well as the young. Once the young are old enough, they might leave to create their own pride.\nBut these prides can have up to 40 members and that\u2019s a huge number for big cats. They usually hunt big preys such as rhinos, hogs, zebras and much more.\nHowever, the Asiatic lions are not quite different from the other big cats because they will leave the family after mating or doing a large kill.\nThis is because the main hunters are female lions. They also hunt big preys like buffaloes and goats. But, they would also opt for smaller meals like mice and birds as well.\nThe habitat of a lion is not as widespread as the other big cats, but that still proves a slight yet huge differences between the lions living in one place to another. From the way they socialize to hunt, habitat is indeed interesting to be looked into further. While lion lives in tropical habitat, you can also seek information about colder weather, such as habitat of a polar bear. Currently, the population of lions are declining, and they are in the status of vulnerable."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Animals That Can Kill a Lion - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/animals-that-can-kill-a-lion/", "text": "The lion may be considered the king of the jungle, but that doesn\u2019t mean that this predator is invincible. The African habitats that these big cats call home have bred a variety of dangerous creatures \u2014 and many of them are willing to take down a lion whether it\u2019s in self-defense or as an act of territorial opportunity. Here are eight animals that have been known to kill a lion in the right situation.\n#8: Giraffe \u2014 Long and Dangerous Legs\nA giraffe can kick with a force of 2,000 pounds per square inch.\nLike most apex predators, lions tend to pick out the sickest and most vulnerable prey animals to target, a form of natural selection that keeps evolutionary trends pressing forward \u2014 but it\u2019s a tactic that makes sense when you take into account the sheer weight and reach of a giraffe. The average male giraffe weighs comfortably more than 2000 pounds and reaches a height of seven feet before calculating their six-foot necks. That leaves them towering over the average 450 pounds and seven-foot-long lion. While giraffe calves are easy targets, adults offer a risk that\u2019s as high as it is high reward. Because while a single corpse can feed a pride and their hovering scavengers for quite some time, a giraffe can kick with a force of 2,000 pounds per square inch. That\u2019s enough to decapitate a lion who gets too close.\n#7: Crocodile \u2014 Nightmares of the Nile\nCrocodiles use the tactic of drowning lions that are too deep in the water.\nLions aren\u2019t afraid to poach eggs from an alligator\u2019s nest when opportunities are lean, but adults of the species can pose a real danger to lions. These species don\u2019t normally intercede on one another, but large carcasses can draw them into territorial disputes \u2014 and crocodiles have been known to prey on lions that are caught lingering too deep in the watering hole. A crocodile has an average bite force of 3,700 pounds per square inch \u2014 a distinct step up from the 650 PSI bite force of a lion. These are battles where the environment is most likely to determine the outcome. The pack tactics of lions give them an advantage in numerous situations, but a crocodile\u2019s tactic of latching onto a target and simply drowning them can be a very effective way for this animal to kill a lion when challenging lions out of their element.\n#6: Rhinoceros \u2014 A Walking Tank\nA rhino can gore an adult lion with its horn.\nLions are known to selectively prey on the black rhinoceros \u2014 and those that are most selective are generally the lions that live the longest. While lions are known to hunt down rhino calves, attempts to take down fully grown rhinos are rare even when there\u2019s an entire pride of lions at work. While they\u2019re known to sometimes treat elephants as competition, rhinos generally keep to themselves \u2014 and they\u2019re only inclined to attack when they\u2019re feeling like they or their young or being threatened.\nThey may weigh roughly 4,500 pounds, but a full-grown rhino can reach a speed of 35 miles per hour, and its horn is capable of goring an adult lion. Most lions recognize that facing down an adult rhino is not worth the risk, but researchers warn that these attacks of opportunity will become more common as droughts and other weather conditions lead to greater scarcity.\n#5: Porcupine \u2014 A Meal Most Painful\nThe quills of a porcupine can cause the death of a lion.\nWhile the quill-covered porcupine might not seem like an appetizing meal to us, there\u2019s a lot of succulent meat there that can be tempting to predators like lions during lean seasons. Lions that live a long time tend to learn better than to sink their claws into porcupines early on \u2014 and it\u2019s generally young males of the species that try and fail to hunt porcupines. This is a scenario where having friends can mean the difference between life or death.\nLions sometimes die from the quills without anyone to help them, and others are so injured by the attack that they have to resort to hunting easier prey. Defeat at the quills of porcupines and the injuries it brings will often force lions towards human communities for easy prey. Desperate conditions cause young males to hunt dangerous prey like porcupines, and the injuries they suffer push them to more dangerous measures.\n#4: Hyena \u2014 Power in Numbers\nHyenas, in numbers, have a greater chance of killing a lion.\nHyenas and lions have a lot in common, but their shared habits and habitats make them fierce adversaries. Hyenas are known for eating their prey alive to prevent their kill from getting poached by lions or other larger predators \u2014 and they\u2019re also known to scavenge the kills of lions. Territorial disputes and conflicts over carcasses are common, and victory often comes down to sheer numbers.\nLions are more likely to steal kills from hyenas than the other way around, and, even though these animals can kill a lion, hyenas will generally admit defeat easily and settle to merely harass the lions who have taken over the carcass and steal bits of meat where they can. But in instances where hyenas outnumber lions six to one or where the threat takes the form of smaller lionesses and young males, hyenas have been known to go in for the kill with their sharp claws and bone-crunching teeth.\n#3: Water Buffalo \u2014 Fighting as Family\nWater buffalo use the size of their herd to attack and kill lions.\nWater buffalo aren\u2019t the largest prey that lions are known to pursue, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less deadly. Lions take advantage of the large herds that these animals travel in and strike from behind to avoid their brutally sharp horns. Lionesses will either take a buffalo by surprise or bring down the weakest and slowest when the herd flees \u2014 but those same herd tactics can be lethal to lions.\nMany buffalo herds practice mobbing tactics which take advantage of their sheer numbers to chase off or even kill lions that dare attack them. Water buffalo pose a proactive threat as well, as these giant ungulates are known to seek out lion cubs and trample them to death before they can grow and pose a threat to the buffalo\u2019s herd.\n#2: Hippo \u2014 Jaws of Death\nA hippo\u2019s jaw has an 1800 PSI bite force. PhotocechCZ/Shutterstock.com\nWhile they may just look like big, goofy pigs, hippos kill more humans a year than lions. Lions usually make a habit of respecting their territorial boundaries. Despite weighing over 3,000 pounds, these enormous mammals can reach top speeds of 35 miles per hour. Despite that, a lack of food sometimes leads lions to attack hippos \u2014 though this requires coordination on the part of a group of lions.\nThanks to the sheer size of the hippo and the thickness of their skin, even an organized lion pride will need to spend a lot of time wearing down their prey. By contrast, the 1800 PSI bite force of a hippo\u2019s jaw \u2014 combined with their prominent teeth \u2014 can pulverize the body of a lion easily. One wrong move could mean defeat for the lion. Lions may also become a target of an angry hippo if they find themselves venturing into their watery territory.\n#1: Elephant \u2014 Big Body and a Big Brain\nAn elephant can reach up to 14,000 pounds, giving it a weight advantage over a lion.\nThe elephant is the largest land mammal, a characteristic that ensures a pride will need all lions on deck to have a chance of bringing one down with claws and teeth. It\u2019s no surprise that these animals can kill a lion. That\u2019s why lions mostly target elephant calves \u2014 and it\u2019s why these social creatures have developed protective habits to keep their young safe.\nA male elephant can reach an incredible weight of 14,000 pounds, and entire herds will circle up to physically shield their young against lions. The tusks and heavy hooves of an elephant are a formidable threat for even a group of lions, but they\u2019ve also been known to pick up trunks as large as 400 pounds and swing them like weapons against attackers.\nLions can easily die when facing even a single grown elephant, and those who don\u2019t might find themselves unable to survive with the injuries they\u2019ve suffered. Age gives elephants more than a weight advantage too. Researchers have discovered that older elephants have developed more sophisticated methods for defending against lions and that they spread that knowledge to actively shield their herd against threats.\nNext Up: Are Guinea Pigs Nocturnal?"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Educative Aquatic Animals Information For Kids - MomJunction", "url": "https://www.momjunction.com/articles/water-animal-facts-for-kids_00401580/", "text": "IN THIS ARTICLE\n70% of the earth is covered in water. Can you imagine the number of creatures living in that space? Well, here\u2019s some aquatic animals information for kids that will leave them astonished. The never-ending water body is filled with various aquatic animals that are interesting, unique, and mysterious. Although we have explored only five percent of the water bodies, we have already discovered around 230,000 species. So, if your child enjoys learning about marine animals, our list covers the detailed information and fun facts to keep them entertained. Read on to know more.\nWhat Are Aquatic Animals?\nWater or aquatic animals are either vertebrate or invertebrate animals, which live in aquatic all through or most of their lives. These animals may breathe air through lungs or gills by extracting the oxygen that is dissolved in water.\nTypes Of Water Animals:\nAquatic animals living in freshwater are called freshwater animals and those living in saltwater bodies such as sea, oceans, etc., are called marine animals.\nVarieties Of Aquatic Animals:\n1. Sea turtles\nThey have been on earth far earlier than 220 million years and have survived extreme weather changes, which wiped out even the dinosaurs . The female sea turtles can return to the same beach that they were born in even after 30 years. (1)\nOne of the few animals with blue blood, Octopuses are considered the most intelligent of all the invertebrates. Scientific studies are increasingly confirming that they are sentient creatures. (2)\n2. Seahorses\nThey are unique in a way that the male carries the babies, instead of the female. The female deposits her eggs in a pouch in the male. The mating ritual includes dancing and intertwining the tails. Pregnancy lasts for two to five weeks with just one percent of offspring surviving to reach adulthood. (3)\n3. Blue whales\nThey are the largest animals and have evolved from the hippopotamus. They are an endangered species with just 4,500 left on the planet. They can swim up to five miles an hour, but on sensing danger, they can speed up to 30 miles an hour. The best part about blue whales is that they can sleep while swimming with half its brain functioning. (4)\n4. Dolphins\nIt is one of the most beautiful, intelligent, and friendly aquatic animals, are the only mammals that are born tail first. They take care of and nurture old or hurt members in a group, and the young ones live with their mothers until they are three years old. (5)\n5. Electric eels\nThey belong to knife fish family and are one of the 500 fishes that can produce electricity. The skin of the eel insulates it from its electric attack, but if the eel is wounded it could shock itself. The electric shock of an eel is powerful enough to knock down a horse and can prove fatal to a human. Some eels produce enough electricity to light ten bulbs! (6)\n6. Jellyfish\nThey are one of the oldest aquatic organisms and came into existence even before the dinosaurs. They have been around for 500 to 700 million years. Some species possess light-sensitive organs and can glow in the dark. The jellyfish does not have bones, brain, heart, and head. (7)\n7. Oysters\nThey can change genders depending on the mating situation. They can also change back to their original genders! (8)\n8. Great white shark\nIt is one of the most well-known species of the aquatic animals and the largest predators in the oceans. Sharks may attack humans, but they don\u2019t eat them as humans lack fat. Great Whites in South Africa are famous for their majestic jumps from water. Male sharks mature when they turn ten while females mature when they turn 15. Females give birth to two to ten sharks after a year of pregnancy. Baby sharks care for themselves from the moment they are born; parent sharks don\u2019t exhibit parental care. (9)\n9. Piranha\nIt means fish tooth, and they possess powerful jaw bone and pointed sharp teeth. They have extremely sensitive organs that help them detect blood in oceans just like the sharks. Piranhas are not only omnivorous but also cannibals, with an insatiable appetite for blood. (10)\n10. Cuttlefish\nIt is a slow swimmer, and swims by emitting out a large quantity of water from its mantle. The phenomenon is known as jet propulsion, and it aids cuttlefish in escaping predators. They also release ink to escape from shark and large fishes. Cuttlefish was widely used as source of ink in ancient times. (11)\n11. Walrus\nBeing mammals, can easily stay under water for 30 minutes without having to come to the surface to breathe. They are incredibly protective of one another and would rush to help any walrus under attack. (12)\n12. Starfish\nThey can change their gender at any time, reproduce sexually or asexually, and in sexual reproduction, the females produce millions of eggs. Though most starfish have only five arms, some could have about 20 to 40 arms as well. They can regenerate a body part within a year. (13)\n13. Giant squids\nThey are one of the most mysterious animals and live at depths of 2000 to 3000 feet in the oceans. Information on giant squids depends entirely on the carcasses found at beaches. They don\u2019t hunt predators but ambush them. Some produce luminescent inks to escape predators. (14)\n14. Dugong\nIt is popular as \u2018sea cow\u2019 and is one of the few vegetarian aquatic mammals. They survive only on sea grass and can consume about 88 pounds of seaweed every day. They are a vulnerable species that need protection and are put up in various sanctuaries across the world. (15)\nHow Do Water Animals Breathe?\nHow do aquatic animals breathe underwater and what if there were no oxygen to breathe?\nA few large or very small animals living in moist environments breathe through the skin. The exchange of gasses takes place through the skin and is called an integumentary exchange. Animals living in water have gills, which are extensions of their outer membranes and contain very thin cells designed to allow gas exchange as the water passes through them.\nWhat Do Aquatic Animals Eat?\nAquatic Animals eat a variety of foods. Animals like corals, sponges, and whales eat small crustaceans called plankton. Ocean fishes have different feeding habits. Usually, most ocean fishes eat each other and eat crustaceans like shrimp, crabs, and krill. They also feed on algae, kelp, plankton, detritus, and cephalopods like octopus and squid, besides echinoderms like sea urchins. A few ocean fishes are scavengers and feed on the carcasses of other marine animals.\nWhich Ocean Animals Eat Plants?\nMany marine animals are carnivores. But a few such as sea turtles, manatees, and dugongs, are specialized in feeding on underwater plants. Marine fishes such as marbled parrotfish are primarily herbivorous. They graze on algae and seagrass in nearshore waters. Other species like surgeonfish and pinfish directly feed on seagrasses.\nHow Do Aquatic Animals Survive In The Ocean?\nMarine organisms have adapted to diverse habitats and environmental conditions in oceans. They have made several physiological, behavioral, and structural adaptations for survival. Morphological or structural adaptations were made to suit and survive in a particular habitat. Physiological adaptations made by sea animals are more related to the way their body metabolism works. Aquatic animals have learnt several behavioral adaptations to survive and escape from predators.\nPotential Threat To Water Animals\nDue to the fragility of the environments in which they live, conservationists often have a special concern for aquatic animals. Aquatic animals are prone to pressures like destructive fishing, overfishing, climate change, and marine pollution which comes from land and air. Harsh chemicals, which pollute water, show devastating effects on marine species.\n21 Aquatic Animals Information And Facts For Children\nDolphins are so clever that they sleep with one eye open and half their brain awake, to keep a watch on predators and threats.\nThe blue whales call at 188 decibels, which is the largest sound produced by any animal on earth.\nTurtles probably do not like Antarctica.

So come on gang, let\u2019s discover some wonderful walrus facts\u2026\nWalrus facts\n1. There are two sub-species of walrus\nWalruses can be found in the far north of our planet. They live in the Arctic \u2013 a vast wilderness of snow, ice, and sea.\nThe Arctic landscape is so large and varied, that walruses that live there have developed slightly different characteristics, in order to adapt to the particular part they live in \u2013 these are known as sub-species.\nAtlantic walruses live in coastal areas from Canada to Greenland (in the Atlantic Ocean), while Pacific walruses live in the northern seas above Russia and Alaska (in the Pacific Ocean). Cool!\nBET YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW! The scientific name for a walrus is \u2018Odobenus rosmarus\u2019. That\u2019s Latin for \u2018tooth-walking sea-horse\u2018!\n2. Walrus tusks can be over 90cm long!\nSpeaking of teeth, walruses have some whopping canines! Both male and female walruses grow long tusks, which help them adapt to Arctic life.\nThese massive, marine mammals use their tall tusks like ski poles, digging them into sand, snow and ice to help them haul their enormous bodies out of the freezing ocean waters! Plus, they\u2019re great for smashing through tough ice from below, creating breathing holes for swimming walruses to catch a breath.\n3. Thick layers of blubber protect walruses from the cold\nThese massive animals don\u2019t carry all that weight around for no reason! The thick layers of blubber (fat) stored beneath their skin helps walruses stay insulated, keeping them warm and protected from cold. In fact, thanks to all that brr-illiant blubber, walruses are able to withstand freezing temperatures, as low as -35\u00b0C!\n4. Walruses weigh up to 1.5 tonnes!\nEven baby walruses are huge! These chunky critters, known as calves, can weigh up to 75kg at birth \u2013 that\u2019s the same weight as some adult humans!\n5. Their huge size comes from a steady diet of molluscs, crustaceans, and worms!\nWalruses grab shellfish like clams from the sea floor, but they also enjoy sea cucumbers and mussels. Adults will sometimes hunt fish, while some huge adult males have even been recording stalking seals.\nAMAZING ADAPTATIONS! Walruses have super sensitive whiskers, which help them detect food at the bottom of the ocean. Once they\u2019ve located a tasty snack, walruses can be surprisingly speedy swimmers, reaching speeds of up to 35km/h to chase down their prey!\n6. Walruses can sleep in water!\nSometimes, walruses will forage in places where there\u2019s no nearby ice or land for them to haul themselves out onto for nap. That\u2019s why they have handy \u2018pharyngeal pouches\u2018 \u2013 air sacs on their throats that inflate like pillows!\nOnce their pouches are filled with up to 50 litres of air, walruses can doze off, snoozing in a vertical position and kept safe from drowning by their portable pillow \u2013 genius!\n7. Walruses can live for up 40 years\nWalruses have very few natural predators, and their huge size makes them a challenging opponent! Only an orca or a large polar bear would dare try to take on an adult walrus\u2026\n8. These astonishing animals are very sociable, but can be aggressive\nA walrus colony is a noisy place! These animals live in large groups, known as herds, which gather together on land. Out of the water, the walruses loudly bellow and snort at one another to communicate!\nDuring the mating season, male walruses can become very aggressive as they fight for females using their tall tusks. Yikes!\n9. Indigenous Americans are the only people allowed to hunt walruses\nSadly, humans are the biggest predator that the walrus has ever faced. During the 1700-1800s, walruses were almost hunted to extinction, as their meat, tusks, oil, and skin were valuable materials.\nNow, walrus hunting is illegal for everyone except for indigenous groups like the Inuit, for whom walruses are still a major life resource.\n10. Walruses are very sensitive to changes in their environment\nDespite their formidable size, walruses are easily spooked! In walrus herds, any sign of danger can cause stampedes as the animals flee land and head towards the safety of water.\nThanks to Helene Berger; Kira Ph\u1ea1m; Caterina Sanders and Jay Ruzesky for the images used in this article.\nDid you enjoy our wonderful walrus facts?

{"animal": "lion", "title": "10 Amazing Animal Heart Facts - NC State Veterinary Medicine", "url": "https://cvm.ncsu.edu/10-amazing-animal-heart-facts/", "text": "They can be as big as a piano or too small to see without a microscope. They may beat as much as 1,000 \u2014 or as little as six \u2014 times a minute.\nThey are animal hearts and they\u2019re extraordinary.\nYes, the human heart is pretty astonishing, too. The thing has its electrical impulse, so with enough oxygen it can beat when outside of the body.\nBut then again, we just have one of them. The octopus has three. And it just gets more amazing from there.\nBeat It\nThe cheetah is one of the fastest land animals, but its resting heart beat is about 120 beats per minute, similar to a jogging human. Here\u2019s the difference: While it takes some time for a human heart to reach its limit, usually 220 BPM, the cheetah can go up to 250 BPM in just a few seconds.\nReally Beat It\nThe cheetah has a bit of competition, however, with the Etruscan shrew. The smallest known mammal by mass, the Etruscan shrew weighs in at under 2 grams and has a 25 beats per second heart rate. That\u2019s a 1,500 BPM. It\u2019s also kind of cute.\nSizing It Up\nThe human heart is about the size of a fist \u2014 and a cow\u2019s heart is the size of a human head. The largest animal heart is the blue whale\u2019s, which has been weighed at about 400 pounds (and it is not the size of a small car, contrary to popular belief).\nBut the animal with the largest heart-to-body-mass ratio is somewhat surprising: the dog. Compare a dog\u2019s heart to its body mass and it\u2019s a .8 percent ratio. Almost all other animals \u2014 including elephants, mice and humans \u2014 have a .6 percent ratio. Another animal with a ratio larger than most mammals is the dog\u2019s ancestor, the wolf.\nSizing it down\nThe smallest animal hearts belong to the .006-inch long fairyflies. You need a microscope to see its heart, which is a tube running along its back. A new species of fairyfly found in Costa Rica is named Tinkerbella nana.\nRoom for Growth\nThe tropical, freshwater zebrafish is a popular aquarium addition, but it\u2019s the animal\u2019s heart that deserves the most attention. It has amazing regenerative properties, quickly closing injuries and mending itself back to almost full function.\nThat\u2019s why researchers study the zebrafish to uncover possible treatments for heart failure and other cardiac injuries. At the CVM, the zebrafish is helping us unlock some of the mysteries of the human immune system.\nTriple Play\nHuman hearts, like those of all mammals, as well as birds, have four chambers. The heart\u2019s \u201cthump-thump\u201d sound is the four valves opening and closing as they pump blood. But frog hearts have three chambers \u2014 two atria and one ventricle (you can actually see how it works in a glass frog).\nA Little Help\nActually, all reptiles have three-chambered hearts with one exception. Crocodilian hearts have four chambers, but unlike mammals they have an extra flap that can close to keep blood from going to the lungs. Researchers believe the blood can be sent to the stomach to aid digestion, which is just a smidge helpful when bones are often on the menu.\nDive right in\nMany animals decrease their heart rate while diving into water. An emperor penguin\u2019s heart rate dips 15 percent from its resting rate when diving and drops even more during long dives (in between dives it jumps rapidly, likely to replenish tissues with oxygen). A manatee heart rate cuts by half while on a long dive and seals decrease their heart rate from 50 to 80 percent while diving. By the way, seals eat squids, which, like octopuses, have three hearts.\nComing Up Empty\nThere are also numerous animals with no hearts at all, including starfish, sea cucumbers and coral. Jellyfish can grow quite large, but they also don\u2019t have hearts. Or brains. Or central nervous systems. It\u2019s working for them, though. They\u2019ve been around at least 500 million years.\nHow \u2026 cute?\nPairs of dragonflies and damselflies (damselflies are different than dragonflies and, yes, that\u2019s what they\u2019re called) form heart shapes when mating. The male grabs the female behind its head and the female \u2026 uh, how about we just show you a photo?\nSources: The Central Florida Zoo; National Park Service; National Wildlife Federation; Journal of Experimental Biology; National Science Foundation\n~Jordan Bartel/NC State Veterinary Medicine"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "The 10 Weirdest Animal Facts - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/weirdest-animal-facts-4116013", "text": "Some animal facts are weirder than others. Yes, we all know that cheetahs can run faster than motorcycles, and that bats navigate using sound waves, but those tidbits of information aren't nearly as entertaining as immortal jellyfish, butt-breathing turtles, and three-hearted octopuses. Below you'll discover 10 truly weird (and true) facts about 10 truly weird (and real) animals.\n01 of 10 Female Spotted Hyenas Have a Penis Getty Images Okay, it may be a bit of an overstatement to say that the female spotted hyena has a penis: more accurately, the clitoris of the female closely resembles the penis of the male, to the extent that only a very brave naturalist (presumably wearing gloves and protective headgear) could hope to tell the difference. (For the record, the female's sex organ is slightly thicker, with a more rounded head than that sported by males.) Only slightly less weirdly, spotted hyena females are dominant during courtship and mating, and prefer to hook up with younger males; clearly they're the \"cougars\" of the mammal family.\n02 of 10 Killer Whales Experience Menopause Getty Images The menopause of human females is one of the mysteries of evolution: wouldn't it be better for our species if women could give birth throughout their lives, rather than becoming infertile around the age of 50? This enigma isn't diminished by the fact that only two other mammals are known to experience menopause: the short-finned pilot whale and the orca, or killer whale. Female killer whales stop bearing children when they reach their 30's or 40's; one possible explanation is that elderly females, undistracted by the demands of pregnancy and birth, are better able to guide their pods. This is the same \"grandmother effect\" that has been proposed for elderly human females, who provide inexhaustible supplies of wisdom (and babysitting).\n03 of 10 Some Turtles Breathe Through Their Butts Wikimedia Commons A handful of turtle species\u2014including the North American eastern painted turtle and the Australian white-throated snapping turtle\u2014have specialized sacs near their cloacas (the organs used for defecating, urinating, and copulating) that collect air and filter out oxygen. However, these turtles are also equipped with perfectly good lungs, which begs the question: why breathe through your butt when your mouth will do? The answer likely has something to do with the tradeoffs between hard, protective shells and the mechanics of respiration; apparently, for these turtles, butt-breathing is less metabolically demanding than mouth-breathing.\n04 of 10 One Species of Jellyfish Is Immortal Getty Images Before we talk about immortal jellyfish, it's necessary to define our terms. Turritopsis dohrnii will definitely kick the marine bucket if you step on it, pan-fry it, or torch it with a flamethrower. What it won't do, however, is die of old age; the adults of this jellyfish species can reverse their life cycles all the way back to the polyp stage, and (theoretically) repeat this process an indefinite number of times. We say \"theoretically\" because, in practice, it's virtually impossible for a single T. dohrnii to survive for more than a few years; that would require a given individual (either polyp or adult) to avoid getting eaten by other marine organisms.\n05 of 10 Koala Bears Have Human Fingerprints Getty Images They may seem cute and cuddly, but koala bears are extremely devious: not only are they marsupials (pouched mammals) rather than true bears, but they have somehow managed to evolve fingerprints virtually indistinguishable from those of human beings, even under an electron microscope. Since human beings and koala bears occupy widely separated branches on the tree of life, the only explanation for this coincidence is convergent evolution: just as early Homo sapiens needed a way to firmly grasp primitive tools, koala bears needed a way to grasp the slippery bark of eucalyptus trees.\n06 of 10 It's Almost Impossible to Kill a Tardigrade Getty Images Tardigrades\u2014also known as water bears\u2014are microscopic, eight-legged, vaguely repulsive-looking creatures that can be found pretty much everywhere on earth. But the weirdest thing about tardigrades, apart from their nightmarish appearance, is that they're pretty much indestructible: these invertebrate animals can survive prolonged exposure to the vacuum of deep space, endure bursts of ionizing radiation that would fry an elephant, go without food or water for up to 30 years, and prosper in terrestrial environments (Arctic tundra, deep-sea vents) that would kill most other animals, including human beings.\n07 of 10 Male Seahorses Give Birth to Young Getty Images You might think the spotted hyena (previous slide) is the last word for gender equality in the animal kingdom, but you don't know about seahorses yet. These marine invertebrates pair up for elaborate, intricately choreographed mating rituals, after which the female deposits her eggs into a pouch on the male's tail. The male carries the fertilized eggs for two to eight weeks (depending on species), its tail slowly swelling up, and then releases up to a thousand tiny seahorse babies to their fate (which mostly involves being eaten by other marine creatures; sadly, only one-half of one percent of seahorse hatchlings manage to survive into adulthood).\n08 of 10 Three-Toed Sloths Wear Algae Coats Getty Images Just how slow is the three-toed sloth? Not much faster than you saw in the movie Zootopia; this South American mammal, when it isn't entirely motionless, can hit top speeds of a blazing 0.15 miles per hour. In fact, Bradypus tridactylus is so crepuscular that it can easily be overtaken by unicellular algae, which is why most adults sport shaggy green coats, making them (for all intents and purposes) equal parts plant and animal. There is a good evolutionary explanation for this symbiotic relationship: the green coats of three-toed sloths provide valuable camouflage from jungle predators, notably the much, much faster jaguar.\n09 of 10 Octopuses Have Three Hearts and Nine Brains Getty Images There's a reason vaguely octopus-like creatures often feature in science-fiction movies as super-intelligent aliens. The anatomy of octopuses is alarmingly different from that of humans; these invertebrates have three hearts (two of which pump blood through their gills, the other to the rest of their bodies), and nine aggregations of nerve tissue. The primary brain resides, appropriately enough, in the octopus' head, but each of its eight arms also contains its share of neurons, which allow for independent movement and even primitive \"thinking.\" (Let's keep things in perspective, though: even the smartest octopus only has about 500 million neurons, one-twentieth the amount of the average human.)\n10 of 10 Dugongs Are Closely Related to Elephants Getty Images You might naively assume that dugongs\u2014the awkward-looking marine mammals that drunken sailors once mistook for mermaids\u2014are most closely related to seals, walruses, and other pinnipeds. The fact is, though, that these ocean dwellers descend from the same \"last common ancestor\" that spawned modern elephants, a tiny quadruped that lived on dry land about 60 million years ago. (Dugongs belong to the same family, the sirenians, as manatees; these two mammals went their separate ways about 40 million years ago.) The exact same pattern was repeated by (unrelated) whales, who can trace their ancestry to a population of dog-like mammals that lived during the early Eocene epoch."}

Scream? Run? Faint?\nNot \u00c7a\u011fan \u015eekercio\u011flu. Instead, he took a deep breath and kept his camera rolling from inside his vehicle, capturing a rare video of an Ethiopian lion. (See 15 intimate portraits of lions.)\n\u015eekercio\u011flu, a National Geographic Explorer and ornithologist at the University of Utah, recently traveled to the Bale Mountains National Park to study the long-term effects of climate change on birds. On the long drives between birding sites, he also conducted mammal road surveys.\nFor more on big cats, tune in to Big Cat Week, premiering Monday, Feb. 20, at 9/8c on Nat Geo WILD and learn more about the National Geographic Big Cats Initiative , a global initiative that supports scientists and conservationists working to save big cats in the wild.\n\u201cThat night, we hit upon the best mammal of all,\u201d says \u015eekercio\u011flu, who is also a trained videographer and photographer. (See \u015eekercio\u011flu's adventures on his Instagram.)\nMost African lions live in the classic savannah habitat of sub-Saharan Africa, but there are a few populations scattered in other countries, including the mountains of Ethiopia.\nEthiopian lions, known for their unusually black manes, were feared extinct until a population of around 50 were rediscovered in 2016. Because few scientists have studied these big cats, it's unclear if they\u2014and another group of a hundred or so lions across the border in Sudan\u2014represent a separate subspecies.\nCarried Away\n\u015eekercio\u011flu says it took a lot of willpower to keep the camera steady through the open window when the male lion approached within a few feet of his vehicle.\n\u201cPart of me was thinking, \u2018This is great footage, and I have to keep still,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe scientist part of my brain was super excited, but the regular person part just wanted to get out of there.\u201d\nHans Bauer, a conservation biologist with Oxford University\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) and part of the team that recently found the animals, noted that the video is valuable information, but that \u015eekercio\u011flu was not in any danger. (Also see \"Don't Feed the Bears: Ethics in Wildlife Photography and Filmmaking.\")\n\"I appreciate that people get enthusiastic when they see [a] lion. But people get carried away and make it more than it is,\" Bauer says.\nBecause the light shining in the lion's face likely blinded him (Bauer notes he stumbled a few times) the animal probably did not perceive \u015eekercio\u011flu as potential prey.\n\"He just finds an annoying big stinking noisy machine [in] his way and wants to get past.\"\nNo Man\u2019s Land\nLions may seem plentiful for how much they show up in nature documentaries, but the truth is much more bleak.\nSince 1980, global lion populations are thought to have declined by up to 75 percent, and there may be fewer than 20,000 of the big cats remaining in the wild. The lion is considered vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nEthiopia\u2019s lions, in particular, are intriguing due to their remoteness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a three-day drive from civilization to get where the lions are,\u201d says Bauer. (See \"Lions Are Wandering Out of Parks and Into Cities.\")\n\u201cAnd if you have any problems with the car, you are really in trouble. It\u2019s not somewhere you go for the weekend.\"\nIn fact, Alatash National Park has never had a tourist, the report says, so ecotourism safaris are unlikely.\n9:08\n\"There is no lodge. There are no roads. There is no water, no electricity,\" Bauer says.\n\u201cThe park was created basically for habitat protection and to fight against desertification, sort of a green barrier for the Sahara.\"\nLow Priority?\nDuring Bauer and colleagues' first expedition in Alatash National Park, the team didn\u2019t have enough cameras or time to do a proper survey.\nSo he's heading back to the park soon to try to radio-collar and track lions. (Learn more about National Geographic Society's Big Cats Initiative.)\nAmong many questions, he hopes to learn more about the genetics of Ethiopian lions and how they're related to other lion populations elsewhere in Africa. Anecdotal reports suggest Ethiopia's lions stay pretty much in the same place, which would mean they're genetically isolated.\nThis doesn't protect them, though. Pastoralists travel to the lions\u2019 habitat each year to allow their livestock to graze, potentially putting the big cats in conflict with people. Poaching, degradation of habitat, and human encroachment are all likely threats, according to the experts and a 2015 WildCRU report.\nAdds Bauer, \"Ethiopia is a wonderful country, but it\u2019s not a country where lions are top priority.\"\n\"These animals are really much more endangered than people think.\"\nFollow Jason Bittel on Twitter and Facebook."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion facts, photos, videos, sounds and news - Big Cat Rescue", "url": "https://bigcatrescue.org/lion-facts/", "text": "Lion \u2013 Panthera leo\nThis \u201cKing of Beasts\u201d once roamed over most parts of the world including Africa, North America and Eurasia. Today, however, they are restricted to the savanna, open expanses, and grassy plains of Africa, and to a small area of western India. There are about 15,000 lions in the wild today. Just ten years ago that number was closer to 50,000. The shrinking numbers are due to hunting and overpopulation of humans.\nOne hundred and fifty years ago, there lived a subspecies of lion, Panthera leo persica, which was found from India to the Middle East. There are only an estimated few hundred alive today. They can be found in the Gir forest sanctuary in Gujarat, in western India. A sanctuary was set up in 1966 in the Gir forest to try and protect the surviving numbers of Asiatic Lions in India. They are endangered due to hunting and other human factors.\nThe Lion is the only cat that lives in large social groups, shares its territory, and regularly hunts together. The Lion\u2019s diet consists of wildebeests, antelope, zebras, wild pigs, buffalo, impalas, and other hoofed mammals. The Lionesses do all the hunting in large number of groups or pairs. Prey will be approached with stealth until it is in range, then the cats will lunge and kill the prey by biting its neck. Lions are the dominant carnivores in their habitat and will drive away competitors or even kill them.\nThe Lion\u2019s head and body can be up to eight feet, two inches, and tail up to three feet, five inches. Its weight can be up to 550 pounds.\nLions are primarily ground-dwellers, but occasionally jump up tree branches. Most Lions will remain in the same territory all year long, however some are nomadic and follow the seasonal prey.\nLions live together in a pride based upon a group of related females (Lionesses) and their cubs. Surprisingly, the pride is led by a dominant female. When a new male joins a pride it will drive away the other males and kill any remaining cubs, then mate with the females to produce his own offspring.\nA Lioness will give birth to up to six cubs after a gestation period of 15-17 weeks. All of the Lionesses in the pride share in the rearing of the cubs and the males may even be playful with them.\nCommon Name: Lion\nKingdom: Animalia\nPhylum: Chordata (Vertebrata)\nClass: Mammalia\nOrder: Carnivora\nFamily: Felidae\nGenus: Pantherinae Panthera\nSpecies: leo\nNOTE: The lions discussed below are African and Asian.\nMisc: The Lion is the only cat with tufted tails (both sexes) and manes (males), with the manes allowing them to be the only cat which you can distinguish gender from a distance. They are also the only true social cat and live in groups called \u201cprides.\u201d The lion has often been called \u201cthe King of the Jungle,\u201d but that would be most inaccurate. The lion\u2019s habitat does not include the jungle, and therefore, the correct phrase would refer to the lion as \u201cthe King of Beasts.\u201d\nSub-species: Of the known sub-species of lion there seems to be an agreement on 2 as far as genetics go \u2013 Pantherinae Panthera leo leo \u2013 the African lion, and Pantherinae Panthera leo persica \u2013 the Asian lion. Regardless of the area of Africa a lion is found in today, their DNA analysis has shown them to be the same, whereas there is a difference between African and Asian. As of the time of this writing, the Barbary lion has never been tested and compared to these results, and may in fact be a third and distinct lion sub-species.\nSize and Appearance: Second only in size to the Siberian tiger among the felines, the lion is the largest carnivore in Africa, and the second largest feline predator in the world. Average males weigh 385-550 pounds, and females weigh 250-450 pounds. The males reach an overall length of 11 feet from the tip of the nose to tip of the tail, and females being just a bit shorter. Lions have a uniformly tawny coat, and the shades of it may vary from light to dark. In the Timbavati region, white lions are found, which is a form of leucism as opposed to albinism. Black (melanistic) lions have not been observed and reports of black lions in captivity have never been confirmed. Males possess a mane and it can range in colors from blonde to red to brown to black. It covers their head, neck and chest, and its development is believed to be strongly influenced by testosterone. Their ears have black spots on the backs, which stay black throughout their lives, unlike the black rosettes that cover their bodies when they are born.\nHabitat: The lion prefers to live in open woodlands and thick bush, scrub, and tall grassy areas. The lion can and will tolerate a wide variety of habitats, absent only from rain forests and desert interiors. While lions drink water regularly when it is available, they can survive by obtaining their moisture requirements from their prey or from tsama melons. This allows them to survive in very arid climates.\nDistribution: The lion was once found from northern Africa through southwest Asia (extinct in most countries within past 150 years), west into Europe (extinct 2000 years ago) and east into India (relic population of 350 in Gir Forest only). Today, the majority of Africa\u2019s lions can be found in east and southern Africa, with about 1,500 in West Africa. Most of the lions today exist inside protected areas. 2007 surveys estimate only 15,000 lions to be left in the wild and most of those are on game parks where they are hunted as trophies.\nReproduction and Offspring: Lions will reproduce any time of the year, and all females of reproductive maturity will breed at the same time. This allows them to give birth in synchrony with each other, thereby sharing the suckling responsibilities. Any lactating female in a pride will suckle any cub that belongs to the pride. Lions give birth to 1-6 cubs after a gestation of 110 days. The cubs are born blind and helpless, and weigh approximately 2-4 pounds. Cub mortality is very high in lions, and less than half will survive their first year. Young males will leave their pride between 2-4 years if they can get away with staying that long, but sometimes they are forced out as early as 13-20 months. Females remain with their natal pride most of the time, although some will disperse and form new prides. While male lions are physically capable of reproducing at 30 months and females at 24 months, they do not generally successfully reproduce until pride membership has been firmly established.\nIn captivity, lions can live 20 years, as compared to 12 in the wild for males and 15-16 for females.\nSocial System and Communication: The lion is the only true social cat and lives in groups called prides. These prides are made up of a single male or a coalition of males (up to 7) and up to 20 females and their offspring. The males defend the females and the territory from strange males, and competition among the males is fierce. A male\u2019s average tenure over a pride is only 2-3 years, but can increase depending on the size and strength of the coalition. Groups of males do better than a lone male. Lions use a variety of vocalizations, most notably the roar. It can be heard over a distance of 5-6 miles, and serves to let other members of the pride know where they are, and as a signal to strange males to stay away. The Africans believe that the lions are speaking and saying \u201che inchi ya nani \u2013 yangu, yangu, yangu\u201d or \u201cwhose land is this? It\u2019s mine, mine, mine!\u201d Hear our roars, hisses, snarls, calls, and growl sounds HERE\nHunting and Diet: Lions are very opportunistic eaters, and will take almost any prey ranging from small rodents to young rhinos, hippos and elephants. The majority of its prey, however, is medium to large ungulates, most notably zebra, wildebeest, impala, warthog, hartebeest and waterbuck. They will stay away from adult rhinos, hippos, elephants and even giraffes. The females do most of the hunting, and the male will come and join the females after the kill is made. The females will make way for the males and allow him to eat his fill first. Males will participate on a hunt when it is a particularly large prey item \u2013 like a water buffalo \u2013 where his size and strength is required to bring down such a large animal (although enough females can do it successfully on their own). Males must also hunt during their bachelor stages, when there are no females to take care of them.\nPrincipal Threats: Lions are generally considered problem animals whose existence is at odds with human settlements and cattle culture. Their scavenging behavior makes them highly susceptible to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Where the wild prey is migratory, lions will predate on captive stock during the lean season, thus making the nuisance animals and easy targets for humans to eliminate.\nStatus: CITES: Appendix II. IUCN: Not listed. (but should be and in 2012 and 2013 BCR petitioned USFWS to add the lion)\n2003 Felid TAG recommendation: Lion (Panthera leo). One of the last SSPs to be developed for an otherwise large and widely held felid, the initiation of the African Lion Studbook in 1992 discovered that only two lions could be traced back to wild founders in Africa. All other lions in zoos, regardless of the institution\u2019s size, were acquired as public donations or from other untraceable sources. Only one purebred Asian lion remains in North America. With a target population of 350 animals, only lions with ancestors that can be traced back to the wild are accepted into the studbook and SSP. Since the SSP began, several dozen lions have been imported, primarily from South Africa, but parties interested in importing additional lions need to ensure that specimens under consideration are unrelated to animals already in this country.\nIn the case of Asian lions, the wild population will continue to be monitored, with future importations possible from sources within the Indian Lion EEP population. Three institutions had mate killings in the past year.\nHow rare is this cat ?

Most, like the margay, are relatively small. But some\u2014the lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, clouded leopard, jaguar, lynx, and cheetah\u2014are big. These big cats are among the most beloved and recognizable animals on the planet.\nMost big cats are members of the genus Panthera. Small and medium cats, including housecats, are member of Felis. Cheetahs, which do not have retractable claws, are in their own genus, called Acinonyx. Big cats are found around the world in habitats as varied as mangrove swamps in India to wooded forests in the western U.S.\nAll about that roar\nThe main difference between big cats and most of their cousins is in the noises they make. Smaller cats purr; big cats (with the exception of cheetahs, lynx, and snow leopards) roar. They also squeak, grunt, scream, and make several other sounds, thanks to a ligament in their voice boxes. The lion\u2019s roar is the most famous and can be heard up to five miles away because of the specialized structure of its vocal chords, a characteristic it shares with the tiger.\nLions are the only big cats that live in groups, called prides. Lionesses hunt together, bringing down large prey like wildebeests and zebras. All other big cats live solitary lives, with the exception of mothers and cubs. Some, like the snow leopard, are especially elusive and rarely seen.\nEndangered cats\nThe largest big cat is the Siberian tiger, which can weigh an astonishing 660 pounds and stretch more than 10 feet nose to tail. It is one of six surviving tiger subspecies. Tigers have been hunted extensively as trophies and for use in traditional Chinese medicine and are listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.\nAs apex predators, big cats are bellwethers for their ecosystems. If they\u2019re doing well, the ecosystem is doing well, and vice versa. As a whole, big cats are under increasing threats from poaching, habitat loss, and other environmental factors."}

The mauling was so savage that it left her with 50 stitches to he face, but it could have been much worse. Furthermore, Melanie Griffith wasn\u2019t the only person mauled by a lion during filming of Roar. So this really begs the question, what was she doing being in a film with the dangerous animal at such a young age, and why on earth did her parents let her near them?\nIt all began in 1969 when Melanie\u2019s mother, Tippi Hedren and her husband Noel Marshall were filming in Africa. One day Hedren, Marshall and the young Melanie stumbled upon an abandoned house that had been overrun with a pride of lions. Inspired with this sight, Marshall decided that he would make a film based on what they had witnessed. It was his, and his families hope that it would shine some light on the plight of the endangered big cat.\nOn their return to the us, they were advised by an animal expert, Ron Oxley, that the best way to get to know lions was to live with them for a while. So that\u2019s exactly what they did. They had some pet lions, and soon had to move to a remote ranch in California when neighbours started to complain.\nHedren and Marshall started filming the movie in 1976. All three family members starred in the film, and it was directed by Marshall. The set included 150 big cats of all description. Some were lions, but it also had cheetahs, jaguars and leopards, just to name a few. It was the largest private collection of big cats ever assembled. When you have large numbers of wild animals all assembled together, danger is never too far away.\nMelanie Griffith gets mauled by a lion\nWhile filming in 1977, Melanie Griffith was mauled by a lion. The attack resulted in 50 stitches to her face. She wasn\u2019t the only one to come off second best for the film. Cinematographer Jan de Bont had to have his scalp sewn back on, and over 70 people were injured during the making of the movie.\nRoar was released in 1981. It had cost Melanie\u2019s mother and step father $17.5 million to make, and it literally flopped at the ticket booth. The movie only managed to raise $2 million in ticket sales. The following year, Marshall and Hedren separated.\n<source> <source>"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Bear Facts: Habitat, Behavior, Diet - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/facts-about-bears-4102853", "text": "Bears (Ursus species) are large, four-legged mammals that have a unique status in pop culture. They are not quite as cuddly as dogs or cats; not quite as dangerous as wolves or mountain lions; but they are decidedly ever-compelling objects of fear, admiration, and even envy. Found in a variety of environments from Arctic ice pack to tropical forests, bears live on every continent except Antarctica.\nFast Facts: Bears Scientific Name: Ursus spp\nUrsus spp Common Names: Bear, panda\nBear, panda Basic Animal Group: Mammal\nMammal Size (length): Sun bear: 4\u20135 feet; brown bear: 5\u201310 feet\nSun bear: 4\u20135 feet; brown bear: 5\u201310 feet Weight: Sun bear: 60\u2013150 pounds; brown bear 180\u20131300 pounds\nSun bear: 60\u2013150 pounds; brown bear 180\u20131300 pounds Lifespan: 20\u201335 years\n20\u201335 years Diet: Omnivore\nOmnivore Habitat: Woodlands, grasslands, deserts, temperate and tropical forests, on all continents except Antarctica\nWoodlands, grasslands, deserts, temperate and tropical forests, on all continents except Antarctica Conservation Status: Least Concern: Brown bears, American black bear; Vulnerable: sloth bear, polar bear, giant panda, sun bear, spectacled bear, Asian black bear\nDescription\nWith some minor exceptions, all eight bear species have roughly the same appearance: large torsos, stocky legs, narrow snouts, long hair, and short tails. With their plantigrade postures\u2014walking upright on two feet\u2014bears walk flat-footed on the ground like humans but unlike most other mammals.\nBears range in color with species: Black, brown and Andean bears are typically red-brown to black; polar bears are generally white to yellow; Asiatic bears are black to brown with a white patch and sun bears are brown with a yellow crescent on their chest. They range in size from the sun bear (47 inches tall and weighing 37 pounds) to the polar bear, (nearly 10 feet tall and weighing 1,500 pounds).\nBuck Shreck/Getty Images\nSpecies\nScientists recognize eight species as well as numerous subspecies of bears, which live in different regions, that have differences in body shape and coloration.\nAmerican black bears (Ursus americanus) live in North America and Mexico; their diet consists primarily of leaves, buds, shoots, berries, and nuts. Subspecies of this bear include the cinnamon bear, the glacier bear, the Mexican black bear, the Kermode bear, the Louisiana black bear, and several others.\nAsian black bears (Ursus thibetanus) live in Southeast Asia and the Russian Far East. They have blocky bodies and patches of yellowish-white fur on their chests, but otherwise resemble American black bears in body shape, behavior, and diet.\nBrown bears (Ursus arctos) are some of the world's largest terrestrial meat-eating mammals. They range across North America, Europe, and Asia and include numerous subspecies, such as the Carpathian bear, the European brown bear, the Gobi bear, the grizzly bear, the Kodiak bear, and several others.\nPolar bears (Ursus maritimus) rival brown bears in size. These bears are restricted to a circumpolar region in the Arctic, reaching south into northern Canada and Alaska. When they're not living on pack ice and shorelines, polar bears swim in open water, feeding on seals and walruses.\nGiant pandas (Aeluropoda melanoleuca) feed almost exclusively on bamboo shoots and leaves in the central and southern regions of western China. These distinctly patterned bears have black bodies, white faces, black ears, and black eyespots.\nSloth bears (Melursus ursinus) stalk the grasslands, forests, and scrublands of Southeast Asia. These bears have long, shaggy coats of fur and white chest marks; they feed on termites, which they find using their acute sense of smell.\nSpectacled bears (Tremarctos ornatos) are the only bears native to South America, inhabiting cloud forests at elevations over 3,000 feet. These bears once lived in coastal deserts and high-elevation grasslands, but human encroachment has restricted their range.\nSun bears (Helarctos malayanos) live in the lowland tropical forests of Southeast Asia. These small ursines have the shortest fur of any bear species, their chests marked with light, reddish-brown, U-shaped patches of fur.\nDiet and Behavior\nMost bears are omnivorous, feasting opportunistically on animals, fruits, and vegetables, with two important outliers: The polar bear is almost exclusively carnivorous, preying on seals and walruses, and the panda bear subsists entirely on bamboo shoots. Oddly enough, though, pandas' digestive systems are relatively well adapted to eating meat.\nBecause the vast majority of bears live in high northern latitudes, they need a way to survive the winter months when food is dangerously scarce. Evolution's solution is hibernation: Bears go into a deep sleep, lasting for months, during which their heart rates and metabolic processes slow drastically. Being in hibernation isn't like being in a coma. If sufficiently roused, a bear can wake up in the middle of its hibernation, and females have even been known to give birth in the deep of winter. Fossil evidence also supports cave lions preying on hibernating cave bears during the last Ice Age, though some of these bears woke up and killed the unwelcome intruders.\nBears may be the most antisocial mammals on the face of the earth. Full-grown bears are almost entirely solitary. This is good news for campers who accidentally encounter lone grizzlies in the wild, but quite unusual when compared with other carnivorous and omnivorous mammals, ranging from wolves to pigs, that tend to congregate in at least small groups.\nDepending on species, a bear's basic communication needs can be expressed with about seven or eight different \"words\"\u2014huffs, chomps, groans, roars, woofs, growls, hums, or barks. The most dangerous sounds for humans are roars and growls, which denote a frightened or agitated bear defending its territory.\nHuffs are generally produced during mating and courtship rituals; hums\u2014a bit like the purrs of cats, but much louder\u2014are deployed by cubs to demand attention from their mothers, and moans express anxiety or a sense of danger. Giant pandas have a slightly different vocabulary than their ursine brethren: In addition to the sounds described above, they can also chirp, honk, and bleat.\nEvolutionary History\nGiven the proliferation of so-called bear dogs millions of years ago\u2014including the standard-bearer of the family, Amphicyon\u2014you might assume that modern bears are most closely related to dogs. In fact, molecular analysis shows that the closest living relatives of bears are pinnipeds, the family of marine mammals that includes seals and walruses. Both of these mammalian families descend from a last common ancestor, or \"concestor,\" that lived sometime during the Eocene epoch, about 40 million or 50 million years ago. The exact identity of the progenitor species, however, remains a matter of speculation.\nGiven that the populations of medieval Europe didn't have much contact with polar bears or panda bears, it makes sense that European peasants associated bears with the color brown\u2014which is where the English name of this animal derives, from the old Germanic root bera. Bears are also known as ursines, a word that has ancient roots in Proto-Indo-European languages that were spoken as far back as 3500 BCE. The long history of this word makes sense, given that the first human settlers of Eurasia lived in close proximity to cave bears and sometimes worshiped these beasts as gods.\nAmphicyon, the \"bear dog\". Wikimedia Commons\nReproduction and Offspring\nLike their close cousins seals and walruses, bears are some of the most sexually dimorphic animals on earth\u2014that is to say, male bears are significantly bigger than females\u200b, and, what is more, the bigger the species, the larger the disparity in size. In the largest brown bear subspecies, for instance, males weigh about 1,000 pounds and females only slightly more than half that.\nHowever, even though female bears are smaller than males, they're not exactly helpless. They vigorously defend their cubs from male bears, not to mention any humans foolish enough to interfere with the child-rearing process. Male bears, however, will sometimes attack and kill cubs of their own kind, in order to induce females to breed again.\nAlthough there are some differences among the species, in general, female bears generally become sexually mature at between 4 and 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years. Bear breeding occurs during the summers\u2014it is the only time when adult bears get together at all\u2014but implantation doesn't typically occur until late autumn. Total gestation time is 6.5\u20139 months. Cubs are born singly or up to three at a time, generally in January or February, while the mother is still in hibernation. The young usually stay with their mother for two years. After mating, females are left to raise the young by themselves for a period of about three years, at which point\u2014eager to breed with other males\u2014the mothers chase the cubs away to fend for themselves.\nJames Hager / Getty Images\nThreats\nConsidering that early humans used to worship bears as gods, our relationship with ursines hasn't exactly been stellar over the last few hundred years. Bears are especially susceptible to habitat destruction, are often hunted for sport, and tend to become the scapegoats whenever campers are attacked in the wild or garbage cans are overturned in suburbs.\nToday, the largest threats to bears are deforestation and human encroachment, and, for polar bears, climate change which is reducing the environment in which they live. On the whole, black and brown bears are holding their own, even though adverse interactions with humans have increased as their habitats become more constricted.\nConservation Status\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the sun bear, sloth bear, Asiatic, and spectacled bears are all listed as Vulnerable and decreasing in population; the polar bear is also listed as Vulnerable but its population status is unknown. The American black bear and brown bear is considered Least Concern and increasing in numbers. The giant panda is Vulnerable but increasing in population.\nBears and Humans\nWithin the past 10,000 years, human beings have domesticated cats, dogs, pigs, and cattle\u2014so why not bears, an animal with which Homo sapiens has coexisted since the end of the Pleistocene epoch?\nOne explanation is that since bears are intensely solitary animals, there's no room for a human trainer to insert himself into the \"dominance hierarchy\" as the alpha male. Bears also pursue such varied diets that it would be difficult to keep even a tame population well-supplied. Perhaps most importantly, bears are anxious and aggressive when stressed, and simply don't have suitable personalities to be house or yard pets.\nSources"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Pumas, Panthers & Cougars: Facts About America's Big Cats", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/27267-pumas.html", "text": "The puma is the big cat of the Americas. At one time, it ranged from the Yukon in Canada to the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America. Because these cats were found in so many places, local tribes or explorers had their own name for the large felines, including cougar, mountain lion, Florida panther and catamount.\nIn fact, there are more than 80 names for the puma, more names than any other animal, according to the book \"Cougar: The American Lion,\" by Kevin Hansen. It is important to note, though, that pumas are not bobcats, lynxes, jaguars, cheetahs or leopards.\nTypically, pumas can be identified by a tan or slightly yellow coat, round face, long tail and erect ears. Adult males grow to 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters) long and females average 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2.1 meters). Males typically weigh 110 to 180 lbs. (50 to 82 kilograms) and the female 80 to 130 lbs. (36 to 59 kg). A puma's tail is almost as long as its head and body combined.\nHabitat & habits\nPumas can adapt to a wide variety of climates and habitats. They are found throughout Central and South America. In North America, however, hunting has reduced their range to isolated areas in Mexico, western U.S. wilderness areas, southern Florida and southwestern Canada, according to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park.\nUnlike other cats, pumas do not live in packs. They live by themselves in large territories, which they mark using urine or feces. Pumas are solitary creatures for good reason. They need hunting room to find enough food to live. Only a few pumas can live in a 30-square-mile (78 square kilometers) radius.\nPumas are crepuscular creatures. They hunt during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk. The low light hides them from their prey. Their excellent night vision gives these predators a distinct advantage during these times of day.\nDiet\nPumas hunt using stealth and strength. To kill their prey \u2014 usually deer, elk or moose \u2014 the puma sneaks up behind the other animal and then chomps down on the prey's neck with its powerful jaws. To make the kill last longer, it hides its prey from other animals and eat bits of the carcass for several days. A puma typically kills a deer every 10 to 14 days, according to the Mountain Lion Foundation.\nPumas can drag prey several times their weight and, given the opportunity, will hunt domestic animals, such as sheep, pigs, horses and other livestock. They will also eat small animals such as porcupines, coyotes, rabbits, armadillos, capybaras, squirrels and raccoons. Some pumas hunt more than others. Patagonian pumas kill around 50 percent more prey than their North American counterparts, according to cougar biologist Mark Elbroch.\nOffspring\nAfter mating, the female will carry her young for a gestation period of 84 to 106 days, according to the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Then she will give birth to a litter of one to six cubs. These cubs are typically covered with spots that can help them blend in with their surroundings. A female will have a litter once every two years.\nA female mountain lion captured and collared in western Nevada for the field component of the study. (Image credit: Jake Willers)\nClassification/taxonomy\nAccording to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), the taxonomy of pumas is:\nKingdom : Animalia\n: Animalia Phylum : Chordata\n: Chordata Class : Mammalia\n: Mammalia Order : Carnivora\n: Carnivora Family : Felidae\n: Felidae Genus : Puma (changed in 1993 from Felis)\n: Puma (changed in 1993 from Felis) Species : Concolor\n: Concolor Subspecies: Six subspecies are recognized: Puma concolor anthonyi, Puma concolor cabrerae, Puma concolor concolor, Puma concolor costaricensis (Costa Rican puma), Puma concolor couguar (Eastern puma) and Puma concolor puma.\nConservation status\nPumas once ranged from the Pacific to the Atlantic, but they were eliminated from eastern North America within 200 years of colonization, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. During the 20th century, large numbers of pumas were killed in the Midwest and Eastern United States by farmers and ranchers who didn't like the puma stealing their livestock. As a result, pumas almost became extinct in those areas.\nThe puma population is not increasing and more are being killed now than ever before because of habitat destruction, trophy hunting, poaching, poisoning and being struck by vehicles on roadways (\"road kill\"), according to the Mountain Lion Foundation.\nPumas are listed as \"Least Concern\" for extinction because they are so widespread, according to the IUCN. However, they are considered to be declining, and the Florida panther is considered endangered, and in Brazil, pumas are considered \"Near Threatened.\"\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists the Florida panther, the Costa Rican puma and the Eastern puma as endangered.\nPumas are a protected species in many areas, with hunting prohibited in many South American nations. In the United States, hunting is legal in many Western states. California, however, banned hunting in a referendum in 1990. Hunting regulations are in place in Canada, Mexico and Peru.\nOther facts\nPumas are extremely athletic. They can run up to 50 mph (80 kph) and jump as high as 15 feet (4.6 meters).\nPumas don\u2019t roar. They use whistles, screams, squeaks and purrs to communicate. To signal to males that she's ready to mate, a female will rub against trees to leave her scent or will yowl loudly so that the local males can hear her call.\nThough pumas are problems for ranchers or farmers, they have a very important role in the environment. They keep populations of animals lower down on the food chain in check. Without them, for example, those same farmers may have their crops overrun by hungry rabbits.\nOther resources"}

If need be, they can maintain 70 miles per hour for the length of 10 football fields before they overheat and must stop.\nHunting by sight they will choose a gazelle, rabbit or young wildebeast and than run the target down, tripping it with a paw swipe or a body check and closing the deal with a choke hold.\nAfter the extreme acceleration however, the cheetah, exhausted, with its massive heart pumping at over 170 beats per minute, must rest and cool down.\nAt this critical time cheetahs often find themselves the victim of a lion, leopard or hyena pack and have their bounty stolen away. Giving up bulk and brawn for their streamlined and swift construction, cheetahs are no match for more robust carnivores and will leave the kill when challenge, and sometimes, in their vulnerable state, be attacked themselves, losing their lives as well as their dinner. - Cheetah Facts\ncheetah reproduction\nThe female cheetah is \"poly estrus\", meaning she will come into heat more than once a year. She will ovulate every 3 to 4 months until she is impregnated. While in estrus female cheetahs will mate with multiple partners but they don't stick around for more than a couple of days.\nA cheetah pregnancy lasts about 90 days. Before she is ready to deliver, the expectant mother will scout out multiple safe dens for future use. She will settle in a den and give birth to as many as 6 cubs, although 3 or 4 is most common.\nThe first 3 months of the little cubs lives is a dangerous time because she must leave them alone while she hunts.\nRaising a family on her own, the mother cheetah is tireless, fearless and cunning. She waits till the hottest part of the day when other predators are snoozing in the shade, to transport her youngsters one at a time from den to den. Every two or three days she will find a new hiding spot. When the cubs reach about 3 months they are finally old enough to travel with her. At 4 months they will start to stalk and hunt and will be taking down prey successfully by 10 months.\nIn an interesting twist, it is the mother cheetah who leaves her cubs at about 18 months. They will remain in a sibling group for another year or so, and then the female siblings will branch off on their own. Males will sometimes live alone, but usually they stay together in groups of 2 to 6 probably related individuals called a \"coalition\". -Cheetah Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They\u2019re born cute and cuddly and grow up into apex predators that rule savannas. Let\u2019s dig into five facts about lion cubs and more importantly dive into five lion baby pictures when they\u2019re at their most cute and cuddly.\n1.) Lions are pregnant for three to four months and can have a litter of anywhere from two to six cubs!\nA lion cub looking as cute as can be! Keith Jenkinson/Shutterstock.com\nThe gestation period of lions is in line with other big cats. While lion gestation periods are about 110 days, other big cats are slightly shorter. For example, mountain lions\u2019 average gestation period is about 92 days while cheetahs rarely exceed 95 days. Lions have about the same gestation period as tigers.\nStill, the lion gestation period (110 days) is less than 40% of a human\u2019s average gestation period (280 days).\n2.) There is a place in Africa where lions live alone (instead of prides) and lion cubs must learn to hunt an antelope by 3 months of age!\nTwo lion cubs embrace Theodore Mattas/Shutterstock.com\nLions hunt in groups called prides, right? Well, normally that\u2019s correct. But there is a single place on Earth where lions hunt alone and lion cubs must become independent at an extremely young age!\nIn Kenya\u2019s Samburu National Park desert conditions make prey much more sparse. Lions have adapted to the habitat by living solitary lives instead of in prides. In this environment lions can\u2019t stay babies for long! Lion cubs in Samuru can bring down small antelopes by the time they\u2019re only 3 months old!\n3. A U.S. President Had Two Lions Cubs as Pets!\nCan you believe a U.S. President kept this as a pet? Vatsyk Elena/Shutterstock.com\nBelieve it or not, but a U.S. President once kept a pet that wasn\u2019t a cat or a dog. Instead he had two lion cubs!\nCalvin Coolidge was President of the United States from 1923 to 1929. While president, the mayor of the South African city of Johannesburg gifted Coolidge a pair of twin lions. Now, you might think a lion name like \u201cSimba\u201d or \u201cScar\u201d would fit a pet lion, but Coolidge went in the opposite direction.\nHe named his twin lions \u201cTax Reduction\u201d and \u201cBudget Bureau.\u201d Let me assure you, Coolidge was not a lot of fun at parties. In addition to twin lions, Coolidge also kept a White House raccoon, a brown bear named Bruno, a wallaby that was moved to the National Zoo, a duiker (small antelope from Africa), and thirteen Pekin ducks.\nLet\u2019s just say the White House had different animals 100 years ago!\n4.) It\u2019s a tough life being a baby lion!\nA lion cub snuggles up against their father Ricardo Reitmeyer/Shutterstock.com\nIf you just want to keep looking at adorable pictures of baby lions, you can skip this fact. But if you continue reading, consider yourself warned!\n80% of all lion cubs die before reaching two years of age. At that age, they become skilled enough hunter to become self-sufficient. Why is being a lion cub so tough?\nFor one, competition for food is tough. Another factor is that when a male lion becomes the alpha of a pride, they will kill lion cubs that are not their own and aged two years or younger. In total, male lions have it the roughest. Only about 1 in 8 (12%) will reach adulthood.\n5. Lion cubs are born with spots and blue eyes, but they lose both when they become adults\nLion cubs are born with blue eyes, but they turn brown with age Benjamin Robert Mitchell/Shutterstock.com\nLion babies have a much different appearance than older lions. For one, their eyes at birth are blue, but as they age their eye color will turn to brown.\nAlso, baby lions have \u201crosettes\u201d or spots similar to a leopard. However, once the lion reachers adulthood the spots will fade away leaving a more uniform coat. While lion cubs on average weigh just 3 pounds and grow to reach in excess of 250 pounds (females are closer to 280 while males reach beyond 400 pounds), their appearance changes much more than growing."}

They inhabit the grasslands of eastern, central, and southwestern Africa, as well as a small portion of Iran.\nCheetahs have several special adaptations that allow them to reach top speeds. Wide nostrils and large lungs combined with a powerful heart and strong arteries provide more oxygen to their muscles. Their huge leg muscles mainly consist of fast twitch fibers, which contract faster than normal muscles. Their small body frame is lightweight and aerodynamic. With long legs, loose hip and shoulder joints, and a flexible spine, cheetahs can cover 7 m (20-25 ft.) in one stride.\nRunning this quickly takes a lot of energy, and cheetahs can only maintain the sprint for about half a minute before burning out. With this limiting factor, they try to get as close as possible to their prey, which include antelope, wildebeest calves, and hares, before starting the chase. Camouflaged against the tall grasses, they quietly sneak up until they are confident of the attack. They burst out, using their tail as a rudder to help keep balance while making sharp turns. Their claws, which do not fully retract, grip the ground like cleats. Once they reach their target, they use their front paw to trip the prey. Then they strangle the animal with a bite and drag it to a hiding spot before another predator, such as a lion, leopard, or hyena, steals it.\nAlthough sometimes confused with leopards, cheetahs are distinguished by their \u201ctear-stained\u201d black marks that run from the corners of their eyes down the side of their nose to their mouth. Their smaller stature and small, flat heads also set them apart.\nThey cannot roar, but they can purr and chirp. Unlike most cats, they have terrible night vision, which is why they hunt during the day. They also cannot climb trees.\nFamily Life\nFemale cheetahs give birth to around three cubs at a time. In the first few weeks, she moves the cubs from den to den, hiding them while she goes out hunting. At this point, they are very vulnerable to predators such as large eagles, lions, hyenas, and baboons.\nYoung cubs grow a thick yellow-gray coat on their backs called a mantle. The mantle protects the cub from the sun and rain and helps camouflage it in the shadows. It also makes the cub resemble a honey badger, which is a small feisty carnivore that most predators leave alone. The mantle starts disappearing when the cub is around three months old and thins to a mane at around two years. Despite these protections, cub mortality rate is high, at around 90%.\nThe cubs that survive start following their mother at around 6 weeks. They practice hunting though play with each other. After a year and a half, their mother leaves them to breed again. The cubs stay together until the females reach sexual maturity at around two years. At that point, other male cheetahs chase the male cubs off. But the male offspring often stay together for life, forming a group called a coalition. Coalitions are beneficial because they help male cheetahs gain territory.\nConservation Status\nToday, around 7,500 cheetahs live in the wild, with about 100 living in small isolated populations in Iran. Cheetahs are threatened by habitat loss and conflicts with farmers. With low genetic diversity, the IUCN Red List considers them vulnerable of extinction.\nWhat You Can Do to Help\nIf you would like to help cheetahs, you can support organizations like the Cheetah Conservation Fund through donations or volunteer work.\nCheetah Distribution\nCheetah Resources\nBlog Posts about the Cheetah"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Elk Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Elk-facts.html", "text": "elk Facts\nPortrait of an Elk\nOne of the most fascinating elk facts, is that their ancestors had 8-inch long tusks, just like a walrus! The elk is the second largest member of the deer family. They are smaller than the moose overall, but their incredible, branch-like antlers are longer than those of the moose, and when measured from the ground to the top of their antler rack, many elk are quite a bit taller than moose.\nA mature male elk may stand over 5 and a half feet at the shoulder, and the largest will top nearly 1100 pounds. The elk is reddish brown in color, with a beautiful wedge-shaped head, and large, expressive eyes and ears. Males grow a huge pair of antlers, and have a mantle of dark fur around the neck. Females and even youngsters of some northern subspecies may also have manes.\nElk also have two large teeth in the upper jaw called ivories, whistlers or buglers. Scientists believe these teeth were once 8 inch long tusks, similar in appearance and direction to those of a walrus. There are small deer species in existence today who still have long tusks, but they don't have antlers. It is thought that when the elk developed antlers as a weapon, it no longer had a need for the tusks.\nElk are adaptable, tenacious, herbivores that eat a large variety of plants, and can exist in many habitats from deep forest to arid, near-desert conditions. They are ruminants, just like cows, and have a four-chambered stomach that allows them to digest lots of vegetation that has little nutritional value.\nDuring winter months, they may strip the bark from trees, and eat moss, twigs and acorns. When food is initially swallowed, it is stored for a few hours in the first stomach chamber, called the rumen. After the food has mellowed, the rumen sends balls of partially digested food back up to the mouth, where the elk will continue to chew it, before finally swallowing it again. This is called \"chewing cud\", and it helps large animals to survive on meager rations.\nThe adaptable elk also grow double coats for winter time that are lighter in color than their summertime garb, to help them blend in. In the spring, they tend to look a little shabby as the fur falls out and is replaced by their rich, single-layered coppery colored summer coat.\nElk are social animals who live in same-sex herds of 10 to 20 individuals, that are loosely structured, and may come together in much larger groups, particularly as they migrate to higher ground. The springtime migration of elk may bring together thousands of animals into one massive herd as they seek out green pastures.\nElk range across much of North America, where they once numbered nearly ten million individuals. The North American elk is also called a wapiti, which means \"white rear\" in the language of the Shawnee Indians, and refers to the distinctive, beige area of fur surrounding the elks tail. They were a vital part of the lives of native Americans, who fashioned elk bones and elk antlers into various tools, weapons and decorations, made clothing and tents from elk hides, and consumed or cured elk meat to survive.\nThe Lakota Sioux also treasured the elk, and male babies were awarded elk ivories to bring long life and prosperity. The Lakota people believed the spirit of the elk brought wisdom and courage to them, and was a symbol of potency.\nAfter European settlers arrived, and with the increase in farming, the elk population dwindled, and by the early 1900's, only about 90,000 elk remained. Today, however, elk populations are healthy, and number close to one million animals across Canada and the United States.\nelk lifestyle\nElk are generally peaceful, social creatures that live together in large herds and cooperate to protect themselves from predators. In late winter and spring, herds of elk, called gangs, are divided by sex.\nFemales may congregate in huge gangs with several hundred members. These include their youngsters from the year before, and are usually guided by a few older members who decide where to graze, when to rest, and when to start migrations.\nMigrating is an important tool in the elks survival, and timing is critical.\nIn the winter months, elk must be near forested areas with many trees for cover, and also to strip the bark.\nWhen spring is near, the females in charge begin to head towards valleys where seasonal grasses will soon emerge. Feasting on freshly sprouted greenery is key to the elk replenishing itself after the harsh winter, during which they may loose up to 250 pounds.\nMale elk may stay alone for awhile after the rut, as long as their antlers stay. The antlers allow them to protect themselves from predators, but weakened bulls will join up early, before their antlers fall, and enjoy the safety of a group.\nMale herds, because they don't include offspring, are generally smaller and more fluid, with members coming and going. Both sexes, however, may meet up and move together in massive herds during the migration, which, in places like Yellowstone national park, may number in the thousands.\nelk facts on reproduction\nBreeding season for elk is late August through early October, and is referred to as the rut. The decrease in daylight brought on by shortening days, triggers a surge in hormones, and while female elk enter estrus at this time, bull elk go through some physical changes as well.\nAs testosterone and melatonin levels increase, the antlers of the male elk calcify beneath the velvet, and he scrapes the soft covering off against trees and stones, revealing a sharp, fresh rack of points. To prepare for jousting, the male elks neck actually gains muscle mass, his mane grows fuller, and the voice box thickens, creating the correct tone for effective bugling. Then males compete for territory and ranking, jousting with eachother, as well as shrubs, tree stumps and sometimes cars and mailboxes.\nThe males size each other up by walking in parallel lines, then turning their racks in, lowering their heads and testing their rivals strength. A few swishes back and forth, knocking antlers together, and then they brace against eachother and drive forward with straining legs, attempting to push straight through the enemy.\nInjuries don't usually occur and the contests last only a few minutes. Exhausted, one or the other flees the scene, chased mercilessly out of the area, often receiving a few jabs in the rump as they go.\nMales will try to attract more than one female, and particularly dominant males in their prime of 6 to 8 years old, may have a harem of 20 or even 40 cows.\nThe elk rut can be several weeks long, and bulls are so excited they forget to eat. A bull at the end of rut may have lost as much as 30% body weight, and are vulnerable to predation at this time.\nFemales are pregnant for 240 -250 days and deliver one baby in the spring. Newborn elk are very well developed, and stand within about 30 minutes of birth. But during the first week of life, they spend most of their time lying quietly in tall grass or woods. They are light red in color with white spots sprinkled across their coats to help them hide.\nBaby elk will lay still in the woods while their mother feeds, and their spotted coats echo the dappling of the sun through the trees. They are instinctively quiet, and perfectly still when approached by anyone other than their mother. The newborn has no scent, and can't be detected by predators, so the mother actually stays a few yards away, coming close to nurse, but generally observing from a distance, for the first week or so.\nBy two weeks old, the mother returns to the herd with her new calf. The elk calf will be weaned in two months, and loses its spots in about six months.\nThe herd is mostly mothers with new babies, yearlings, and older females that did not breed. They will maintain the calves in little nursery groups, where all adults keep an eye on the youngsters. They are vocal in these groups, communicating with eachother with grunts and squeaks, and they will join together and take on predators, including wolves and grizzlies, if calves are threatened.\nThe herd will surround the babies, and will strike out with their forelimbs at anything that poses a threat. One well-placed kick can kill a full grown wolf, and if the herd is truly brave and vigilant, they may drive off even the most fearsome threat.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Antlers are sometimes mistakenly called \"horns\", but antlers are structurally completely different from horns.\nCows and antelopes grow horns, which are made of keratin, the same stuff as hair and nails. Horns don't fall off, they continue to grow throughout the life of the animal, and in most cases, both males and females grow them.\nAntlers are actually made of bone, fall off and are regrown each year, and are usually only found on the males of the species.\nAntlers grow from two round surfaces of bone called pedecils, that are part of the skull. Hormones triggered by seasonal changes start growing in the spring. They begin when the male has low, not high, levels of testosterone, presumably to focus energy on their growth, and insure that the animals are calm and not combative.\nWhile the antlers are growing they are soft and spongy and can be easily damaged, so males are careful with their movements. Antlers are the fastest growing tissue known in mammals, and each spine of the antler may grow at a rate of half an inch a day. The growing antler is a pulpy tissue filled with nerves and blood vessels. It is covered with blood-filled, hairy skin called velvet.\nWeirdest of all elk facts is that while the antler tissue is growing, it can actually be grafted to any part of the elks body, and it would continue to grow. The entire body is dedicated to this remarkable process.\nBy late summer the testosterone level begins to rise, the antler calcifies into solid bone, the velvet dries up and falls off, and the full, pointed rack appears, ready for some jousting action.\nAn intriguing feature of elk antlers, is how much they look like tree limbs...check it out...\na few more elk facts\nMale elk lose their antlers in late winter, and grow a new pair in the spring\nElk have teeth called \"ivories\" that were once 8-inch long tusks like a walrus\nElk antlers may weigh 40 pounds\nElk are ruminants and \"chew their cud\" just like a cow\nA well-organized elk herd can deter a wolf pack attack\nElk are also known by the Shawnee Indian name \"wapiti\"\nElk ivories are used in jewelry\nThe elk antler has properties that can fight cancer and other diseases\nElk are raised on farms where their antlers can be safely harvested without harming the elk\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Cervidae\nSubfamily Cervinae\nGenus Cervus\nSpecies canadensis\nElk - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD gang North America,\nEurope,Asia woodland grass, twigs TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG HEIGHT 45 mph no 400-900 pnds 4.5-5.5 feet\nat shoulder ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH HEIGHT BIRTHWEIGHT 1 x year 245-250 days 24-26 inches 35 pounds RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH STANDS UP mother 1\ntwins rare eyes open,\nfully furred 20-30 minures WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 2 months 9-11 months 3-5 years 12-18 years"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Porcupine Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Porcupine-facts.html", "text": "porcupine Facts\nPortrait of a Porcupine\nThe porcupine is a large, round, slow-moving rodent with a spectacular means of defense. It's muscular body is covered with up to 30,000 long, hollow and pointed quills. The North American porcupine is one of the world's most recognizable animals because of it's body full of prickly spines, that are essentially modified hairs.\nThe porcupine cannot throw it's quills, but if a predator makes contact, the spines easily detach and lodge mercilessly in the attackers skin, causing stinging pain when entering, and tearing the flesh upon extraction.\nAlthough the quills themselves are not poisonous and can't kill, it is possible that numerous spines lodged in an animals face, eyes, or mouth can render them defenseless, or unable to eat or hunt, and a lingering death may occur.\nMost predators willingly allow these imposing animals a very wide path, and porcupines can be observed peacefully trundling along quite impervious to virtually anything, as they search for nuts, berries and buds to eat. They are relatively fearless, but if danger approaches the porcupine gives lots of warning of the pain it can unleash.\nPorcupines have a musky odor that is described as being similar to very rank human body odor. that The musk intensifies if the porcupine is stressed, which should be enough of an alert, but in the event that a dog or bear cub presses the issue, porcupines will chatter their teeth, stamp their feet and rattle their quills together to make a series of intimidating sounds.\nIf the threat gets too close, the porcupine may swing it's rear around and strike the aggressor with it's tail. and when in full attack mode, the porcupine lunges backwards, thrusting dozens of raised quills towards the intended target.\nThe razor sharp quills easily dislodge on contact and have scale-like barbs that pull them a little further into the victims skin with every movement.\nOnly the cougar and the rugged little fisher, which is a type of weasel, regularly kill and eat North American porcupines, and only during lean times. Golden eagles and great horned owls have also been reported hunting them, but in general, porcupines remain unmolested as they go about their business.\nPorcupines are cathemeral, meaning they may be active night or day. They are herbivorous, eating leaves, shoots, buds, fruits and nuts. Although they appear awkward, and are husky to say the least, porcupines of North and South America are actually arboreal and forage, eat and sleep in the trees.\nporcupines!\nThe porcupine is the third largest rodents in the world, behind only the capybara and the beaver. There are about 2 dozen species of porcupines, and these are broken into the Old World porcupines and the New World porcupines.\nThe Old World porcupines are ground-dwellers, and usually live in pairs or small groups. They include the largest porcupine species, the African Cape porcupine, whose extremely long spines (up to 20 inches), can be raised like a crest to make them appear twice as large.\nThe New World porcupines include the familiar, tree-dwelling North American porcupine, also known as the Canadian, or common porcupine. There are about 7 sub-species of North American porcupine, all varying only slightly in size and coloration. They have very long guard hairs that give them a \"fluffy\" appearance, with tens of thousands of quills hiding below.\nAlso from the New World are the amazing prehensile-tailed porcupines of Central and South America, which have naked, prehensile tails, bulbous noses and a prehistoric or even alien appearance.\nporcupine species\nCape Porcupine\nAsiatic brush-tailed porcupine\nRodents make up about 40% of all the mammal species on Earth. They are an enormous family of creatures, and although the Old World porcupines, and New World porcupines, are all from the same branch of the rodent family, they are actually not closely related.\nThe major difference between Old and New world species is that the Old World porcupines live on the ground and often in small groups, while the New World porcupines are mostly solitary and live in trees.\nOld world species range throughout Africa, Asia and Europe, and include brush-tailed porcupines that are only about 4 pounds, to the largest porcupine species, the African cape porcupine, which can be almost 3 feet long and 45 to 60 pounds.\nThe Cape porcupines form monogamous pairs and stay together to raise their 2 to 4 youngsters, called porcupettes. Male Cape porcupines have even been known to raise babies on their own, if the mother passes.\nThe New World porcupines are the North American porcupine, also known as the Canadian or common porcupine, the tree porcupines, and a few other species including the stump-tailed porcupine.\nThe tree porcupines are found in the rainforests of Central and South America. They are covered with dense quills, except for their large noses, bellies and the end half of their tails.\nThe end of the tail is naked, and can grasp limbs and support the animal like a fifth limb. It is not as versatile as a monkeys tail, with which monkeys can actually hold and manipulate items, but is used mostly for support while climbing and reaching for fruits in the trees.\nThe Brazilian porcupine is a prehensile tailed variety that reaches about 24 inches in body length, with a tail that is about 19 inches long. They can weigh up to 15 pounds and spend their days sleeping in the treetops of the Brazilian rainforest.\nAt night, they cruise through the trees eating fruits, twigs, buds, flowers and nuts. They have strong, curved toes that wrap around branches, and a roughened pad on the bottom of the tail helps with grip. These animals occasionally come down from the trees to eat crops or flowers. On the ground, these specialized feet don't conform well to walking. The going is slow and the porcupine will roll up in a ball if it feels threatened, leaving just a shroud of spines to contend with.\nThere are also two species of rat-like porcupines, one native to Africa and the other to Asia, called brush-tails. They have short quills over their bodies and a tuft of quills on the tail which they use as a club when threatened. Brush-tailed porcupines are mostly nocturnal and more omnivorous than the other species, eating insects and small lizards as well as vegetation.\nBrazilian prehensile-tailed porcupine\nporcupine lifestyle\nThe North American, or common porcupine is designed for life in the trees. They have curved claws and powerful curved feet to grasp and climb. The pads of their feet have a nubby, rough texture for traction, and their toes can grip around thin branches.\nIn fact, the porcupine regularly holds on with just it's back toes, stretching to reach young buds at the tips of delicate tree limbs. It is this lust for tender greenery that finds porcupines tumbling from the tree tops on a surprisingly regular basis.\nThe impact may shake numerous quills loose, and leave a smattering of spines on the forest floor. They may also impale themselves on themselves during such an event, which is why nature has coated each quill with a penicillin-like grease that prevents infection.\nCommon porcupines live alone, only coming together to mate. They are mostly nocturnal, but do forage during the day upon occasion. They are exclusively herbivorous eating fruits, nuts, buds and flowers. They have ever-growing front molars that are orange in color, and are capable of chewing right through the bark of mature trees. They will de-bark trees during the winter when food is scarce, and can cause some damage to forests this way.\nIn comparison, the largest porcupine species in the world, the African crested porcupine, and the African Cape porcupine which are very similiar sub-species, is a ground-dweller that can reach 60 pounds in size. They eat roots and bulbs, and regularly raid farmers crops. They spend the heat of the day in burrows or under rocky outcrops, and start foraging at dusk.\nThese animals are monogamous, and may actually mate for life. They live in small family groups, and the male plays a large role in the care of offspring. - Amazing!\ncrested porcupine\nporcupine reproduction\nMalayan porcupine babies\ncrested porcupine mother and baby\nThe North American porcupine is generally a solitary animal. The female comes into season once a year, and attracts potential mates with urine marking and shrill calls in the night. Multiple males may be lured to her, and may engage in fairly aggressive battles that include clawing and biting and swinging their tails at eachother.\nDuring mating season, areas with large porcupine populations will show the results of such battles in lost quills scattered across the forest floor, and the mating calls of both sexes can be heard for miles.\nMale porcupines are acustomed to being punctured by rivals, and remove quills from their own skin by grasping it with their teeth and twisting. When the battles are over and one male emerges victorious, he still must wait for the female to get in the mood.\nHe will choose a perch in her tree, on a lower limb than her, where he can intercept any other males, and keep an eye on her.\nTo woo her, he will spray her with a stream of urine loaded with male pheromones. These chemicals usually stimulate the female, and arouse her. She will climb down to the ground, the male following, and when she is ready she will raise her tail over her back.\nThe male must manage the copulation situation very carefully, and mating can only be accomplished with the females complete cooperation. She is only receptive for a short window of 6 to 12 hours, and the pair will mate several times until the male is exhausted and climbs away home.\nFemale porcupines are pregnant for about 7 months. This is a long pregnancy for a rodent - consider that the larger beaver has a gestation period of 124 days - and it is reflected in how developmentally advanced the newborn is.\nThe porcupine baby, called a porcupette, comes into the world with eyes open and a full coat of spines, but the quills are soft and rubbery, and only harden when exposed to the air. After only about an hour of life outside the womb, the baby porcupine is climbing and nursing, and it's quills are hardened weapons.\nBabies begin to forage for solid food after just two weeks, and are weaned at 3 or 4 months. They stay with mom for about 6 months, with some hanging around for more than a year before heading out on their own.\nPorcupine mother and baby\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Keratin is a common substance in the bodies of most mammals and forms hardened, generally nerve-less structures like fingernails, hair and feathers.\nIn fact, the porcupines quills, although often described as enlarged, modified hairs, are actually closer in construction to feathers. The quill is hollow, like the shaft of a feather, and in the case of some African species, can be as wide as drinking straws. They are raised up away from the body by thin muscles under the skin, and operate like venetian blinds, in rows, much as feathers are organized across the body. All the porcupines have some barbing, usually on the tip of the quill, but the brush-tailed porcupine has small saw-tooth barbs lining the sides of each quill, like the tines on a feather.\nPainful going in, the quills of most porcupines cause even more pain when they are extracted. That's because the tips of each quill have hundreds of microscopic, backward-facing barbs that look much like fish scales. These barbs are flexible and allow the tip of the quill to penetrate deep into the skin, then splay out and bend against the skin when pulled out, anchoring the barb and requiring more force to remove, causing additional tearing as a result.\nThe barbs may cause damage to flesh, and slow, unpleasant deaths of unfortunate victims may result from starvation through the inability to hunt or eat, but infection rarely, if ever, occurs.\nWhy? Because the quills are covered with a thin layer of greasy secretions that actually inhibit the growth of bacteria.\nSo why would an animal that defends itself with such a merciless weapon, provide it's victim with protection from infection? Because sometimes, the victim of the porcupines vicious quills, is the porcupine itself, or, occasionally a family member.\nUsually it takes a bit of an event for accidental punctures to occur. Something like an aggressive encounter, or more often a fall from a tree.\nImagine your a slow moving, rounded, rodent slipping off a tree branch hurtling to the ground, and anywhere you land is a pile of spikes. Well at least you won't get a nasty infection while your waiting to heal.\na few more porcupine facts\nPorcupines can't throw their quills\nPorcupines have a strong, musky \"wet dog\" smell\nThough they are a little clumsy, porcupines are built for climbing\nAfrican cape porcupines have 20 inch quills\nPorcupine quills are hollow\nPorcupine guard hairs are used to make a Native American headress called a \"roach\"\nThe quills have barbs on the tips that cause them to burrow deeper into the skin and make them hard to remove\nThe fisher, a very tough weasel species, regularly eats porcupines\nSome porcupines have prehensile tails like New World monkeys\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Primates\nFamily Cercopithecidae\nGenus Papio\nCommon Porcupine - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT boar sow porcupette, pup,\npiglet solitary GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD array,prickle U.S.A., Canada woodland, brush flower buds TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG LENGTH 6 mph no 18 - 35 pounds 25 - 35 inches QUILL # QUILL LENGTH AT BIRTH HARDEN 30,000 4 - 10 inches quills are soft 1 -2 hours ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH LENGTH BIRTHWEIGHT 1 x year 7 months 6 inches 12-16 ounces RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH CAN CLIMB mother 1 eyes open 2 hours WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 16 weeks 8 months 10 months 8 - 15 years"}

This sound alerts other hyenas that new food source is located.\nWorst enemies of hyenas are lions and hunting dogs. Hyenas are cannibals. They may attack and eat other hyenas, especially when they are young.\nMale and female hyenas look alike and have very similar genitals, but they are not hermaphrodites (animals that may act both as males and as females at the same time). Only female hyena gives birth and takes care of her cubs.\nAfter mating season, it takes 90-110 days for babies to be born.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Black panther \u2013 myths and facts | DinoAnimals.com", "url": "https://dinoanimals.com/animals/black-panther-myths-and-facts/", "text": "Black panther \u2013 facts and myths\nMany people have wondered which of the big cats is called the black panther and if it is a separate species. A black panther is a leopard (Panthera pardus) or jaguar (Panthera onca), whose fur has a black color instead of the usual black rosettes on a gold-yellow background. Under favorable light conditions, the actually spotted coat can still be seen. These panthers are therefore not a species of their own, but a form of melanism.\nMelanism\nThe black panther is a so-called melanistic cat. Melanism is characterized by brown or black skin coloration. It is caused by the presence of an increased amount of melanin (dark pigment). Melanism occurs both in vertebrates and invertebrates. It is either a form of adaptation to the environment (protective function) or a medical condition.\nMelanism occurs, for example, in foxes. The silver fox, for instance, is a melanistic form of the red fox.\nMelanism of jaguars\nMelanism in jaguars is caused by a dominant alternative form of a gene, and in the case of the leopard \u2013 by a recessive form of a gene.\nIf you\u2019re interested in the subject of genetics, we suggest you explore the term allele (one of the forms of the same gene that differs in one or several nucleotides).\nIn natural environment melanistic cats (black panthers) occur more often among cats inhabiting thick forests (less access to light) than open areas.\nWhich cats are black panthers?\nThe black panther is usually:\nThe jaguar (Panthera onca) occurring in South America and Central America, or\n(Panthera onca) occurring in South America and Central America, or The leopard (Panthera pardus) occurring mainly in Africa and Asia.\nWhen it comes to smaller cats that may be melanistic, the jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi / Herpailurus yagouaroundi), which lives in South America, is worth mentioning. It is a small, 53-77 cm long cat with a weight of 3.5 to 9 kg.\nBlack tigers\nIt is also said that there are rare cases of black tigers, but we are not able to confirm this fact.\nBlack cougar \u2013 does it exist?\nOur readers have often asked if there are black cougars. There is no confirmed information about melanism among cougars. Therefore, we have to clearly state that black cougars don\u2019t exist.\nAre all individuals from one litter born black?\nFor people who are familiar with Mendel, the answer will be clear \u2013 not necessarily. In one litter there may be both black and typically colored (spotted) leopards or jaguars.\nLeopard \u2013 black panther\nIn nature, black panthers among leopards mostly occur in thick forests of south-western China, Myanmar (Burma), and Nepal. They also live in southern India \u2013 Travancore, and a north-eastern state Assam, located at the foot of the Himalayas.\nBlack leopards are also common on Java, and in the southern part of the Malay Peninsula, where they may be more prevalent than spotted panthers. These animals rarely occur in Africa, although there are some reports on the presence of black leopards in Ethiopia (former Abyssinia), in the forests of Mount Kenya, and in Aberdares. One of the black leopards was recorded in the equatorial forests of Cameroon.\nThe fur color of the black leopard\nThe fur color of the black leopard is a mix of colors: blue, black, grey and purple.\nBlack panther in captivity\nIn zoos, black panthers are mostly represented by a leopard, and rarely by a jaguar. Black leopards in captivity have been selectively bred over years. These cats are smaller and have more delicate appearance than spotted individuals. Black leopards are also characterized by lower fertility.\nJaguar \u2013 black panther\nIn the case of the jaguar, melanism is a dominant feature (see above). Therefore, the offspring of black jaguars may be spotted or be black as well. However, spotted parents can only have spotted offspring.\nThe jaguars whose both parents are dark, are practically black, while the offspring of a mixed couple (a spotted jaguar and black jaguar) is charcoal, not black. In such individuals, spots may be also visible, as in the picture below.\nThe black jaguar was considered a separate species by the indigenous people of the regions in which the animal occurred.\nBlack panther in literature\nGuenhwyvar \u2013 \u201cForgotten Realms\u201d by Robert Anthony Salvatore\n\u2013 \u201cForgotten Realms\u201d by Robert Anthony Salvatore Bagheera \u2013 \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d by Rudyard Kipling\n\u2013 \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d by Rudyard Kipling The Black Panther \u2013 a comic by Marvel Comics\nBlack lion?\nDon\u2019t be fooled by fake pictures of black lions.

Visit our main animals page: Animals: The Ultimate Guide\nMeet the Golden Lion Tamarin: Introduction\nThe golden lion tamarin, also known as the golden marmoset, is a species of New World monkey. It is a small animal with striking reddish-golden hair. Its face, feet and hands are hairless, and dark pink or black in color.\n(The term \u2018New World\u2019 means the continents of North and South America combined.)\nThe golden lion tamarin\u2019s long fingers are equipped with claw-like nails, which are useful both for climbing trees and for foraging for food.\nThe species gets its name from the long hair surrounding its face, which resembles the mane of a lion.\nIt is thought that the golden hue of the golden lion tamarin\u2019s hair is caused both by sun exposure, and the presence of carotenoids in the monkey\u2019s diet.\n(Carotenoids are a group of yellow, orange and red pigments often found in plants, like carrots and ripe tomatoes.)\nGolden Lion Tamarin Video\nWatch the video below to see golden lion tamarins in a zoo \u2026\nHow Big Is A Golden Lion Tamarin?\nThe golden lion tamarin is the largest species in the Callitrichidae family, but it is still quite small at 19 \u2013 22 cm (7.5 \u2013 8.75 in.) long. It has a very long tail, which is 26 \u2013 33 cm (10.25 \u2013 13 in.) in length.\nGolden lion tamarins weigh from 400 to 822 g (14 to 29 oz.). There are practically no differences between males and females.\nBehavior\nThe golden lion tamarin is diurnal, meaning it is active during the day and sleeps at night. During the daylight hours, it moves about its home range, which can measure from 40 to more than 100 hectares. The golden lion tamarin is territorial, and will defend its territory from other groups.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Lifespan\nThe golden lion tamarin lives up to 15 years in the wild, and up to 20 years in captivity.\nWhere Does the Golden Lion Tamarin Live?\nThe golden lion tamarin inhabits the Atlantic Coastal Forest of southeastern Brazil. The monkey\u2019s lowland seasonal rainforest habitat has been substantially reduced due to deforestation.\nOver 85% of the Atlantic Forest has been destroyed to make way for farms, towns and cities. The Southeast Region of Brazil is one of the most heavily urbanized areas of the country.\nAs a result of deforestation, the golden lion tamarin\u2019s habitat today is only a fraction of what it once was.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Lifestyle\nThe golden lion tamarin is arboreal (i.e. it lives in the trees). It leaps, climbs and runs through the treetops, roaming the forest canopy in search of food.\nThe golden lion tamarin sleeps in tree hollows. It makes its nest high off the ground to avoid predators, preferring dens that are 11 to 15 m (36 to 49 ft.) off the ground. It generally does not sleep in the same den two nights in a row.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Predators\nPredators of the golden lion tamarin include birds of prey, cats, and large snakes.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Diet\nThe golden lion tamarin eats fruits, plant sap, bird eggs, insects and small vertebrates such as frogs and lizards. It is very skilled at using its long fingers and claw-like nails to draw out its food from holes and crevices.\nFamily Life and Social Structure\nThe golden lion tamarin is a social animal. It lives in family groups called Troops. Troops are usually composed of 2-8 individuals. These can include a breeding pair, their young, and possibly other relatives.\nGolden lion tamarins breed once per year. Mating occurs from the end of March through mid-June. Gestation (pregnancy) lasts about 4 months, and the babies arrive from September through February.\nThe young are typically twins, and are very dependent during the first few weeks after birth. They require nursing and being carried around. Both parents share the duties of raising them.\nIs the Golden Lion Tamarin Endangered?\nPopulation counts in the 1970s estimated there were fewer than 200 golden lion tamarins left in the wild. By 1996, they were listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Thanks to conservation efforts, the number of golden lion tamarins has gradually increased, and their status was lowered to endangered in 2003.\nReintroduction Efforts\nConservation efforts include the reintroduction of golden lion tamarins from captive populations into the wild. Complete golden lion tamarin groups have also been relocated from highly degraded habitat to better, protected areas.\nReforestation efforts are also being undertaken to help reestablish some of their habitat.\nThe golden lion tamarin is currently found only in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 14 forests that are very fragmented. There are two protected areas in its range, Po\u00e7o das Antas Biological Reserve and Uni\u00e3o Biological Reserve. However, intact forest is not present even in these protected areas.\nMain Threats\nCapture for the pet trade was a major threat in the past. Currently, the main risk is habitat loss. Urbanization and deforestation have left the tamarin\u2019s habitat very fragmented, isolating the different groups.\nHabitat fragmentation makes it more difficult for the golden lion tamarins to find the resources they need to survive. Also, a fragmented habitat can lead to inbreeding. Inbreeding increases the risk of genetic abnormalities, and decreases the overall health of the population.\nCurrently, there are over 1000 golden lion tamarins in the wild, with another 500 individuals living in captivity. Even though conservation efforts have had some success, there is still much cause for concern. The remaining habitat is not big enough for the population to keep growing and reach numbers that would take them off the endangered species list.\nGolden Lion Tamarin Facts: Conclusion\nWe hope that you have enjoyed finding out about the golden lion tamarin.

Habitats were destroyed to make way for sugar cane and coffee production, cattle grazing, logging, charcoal and urbanization. As a result, in the early 1970s, there were as few as 200 golden lion tamarins in the wild.\nIn 1972, the Zoo held a ground-breaking conference bringing together 28 European, American and Brazilian biologists to save the golden lion tamarin. Long-term recommendations for husbandry were developed for research and conservation activities, including support for the breeding program in Brazil, studies of breeding biology, protocols for captive husbandry and management, medical programs, hand-rearing guidelines, inter-institutional cooperation and the establishment of a studbook and a data bank to record all aspects of their propagation in human care.\nFollowing this important meeting, the Zoo made a major commitment to the captive breeding and conservation of the golden lion tamarin and launched a long-term investigation into the reproduction, social behavior and husbandry of the species in human care. For many years, golden lion tamarins were free-ranging at the Zoo to help them prepare for eventual reintroduction to the wild in Brazil.\nThe zoo population of golden lion tamarins has been managed globally since 1973. In 1981, golden lion tamarins became one of the first species to be designated as part of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums\u2019 Species Survival Plan, with 143 zoos participating in the captive breeding program.\nThe Zoo played an important role in creating the Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Program, which is still active today in field research, reintroduction, environmental education and habitat restoration. Currently, the International Committee for the Conservation and Management of Lion Tamarins advises the Brazilian government on the research and conservation activities for these species.\nGolden lion tamarins were upgraded from critically endangered to endangered in 2003 following these extensive conservation efforts. About one-third of the wild population today originated from golden lion tamarins raised in human care. About 2,500 golden lion tamarins live in the wild, most in or near the Reserva Biologica de Po\u00e7o das Antas in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and an additional 500 are in zoos worldwide.\nWhile the estimate of golden lion tamarins living in the wild has continued to rise in recent years, they are still classified as endangered because their habitat remains fragmented into small, unconnected areas, each only capable of supporting a small number of groups. This has decreased the quality of tamarin habitat and limited their ability to grow populations. It also leaves the species susceptible to diseases. Without intervention, inbreeding will contribute to the local extinction of many of these small populations, and eventually the entire species.\nContinued conservation efforts, such as reforestation and the creation of wildlife corridors, are essential to sustain and grow the overall population, and to ensure all of the hard work put into saving golden lion tamarins is not undone."}

After consuming what they can of their prey, tigers hide animal carcasses from scavengers so they can return to them later.\nSummary\nThe Indo-Chinese (P. tigris corbetti), and Sumatran (P. tigris sumatrae) tigers are bright reddish tan, beautifully marked with dark, almost black, vertical stripes. The underparts, the inner sides of the limbs, the cheeks, and a large spot over each eye are whitish. The rare Siberian tiger has longer, softer, and paler fur. White tigers, not all of them true albinos, have occurred from time to time, almost all of them in India (see also albinism ). Black tigers have been reported less frequently from the dense forests of Myanmar (Burma), Bangladesh , and eastern India. The tiger has no mane, but in old males the hair on the cheeks is rather long and spreading. Although most classifications separate the species into six subspecies, some merge subspecies or suggest that two tiger species exist, P. tigris on the mainland of Asia and P. sondaica of Java , Bali , and Sumatra.\ntiger , (Panthera tigris), largest member of the cat family ( Felidae ), rivaled only by the lion (Panthera leo) in strength and ferocity. The tiger is endangered throughout its range, which stretches from the Russian Far East through parts of North Korea , China , India , and Southeast Asia to the Indonesian island of Sumatra . The Siberian , or Amur, tiger (P. tigris altaica) is the largest, measuring up to 4 metres (13 feet) in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds). The Indian, or Bengal , tiger (P. tigris tigris) is the most numerous and accounts for about half of the total tiger population. Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of about 1 metre and a length of about 2.2 metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; weight is 160\u2013230 kg (350\u2013500 pounds), and tigers from the south are smaller than those of the north.\nNatural history\nThe tiger has adapted to a great variety of environments, from the Siberian taiga, where nights can be as cold as \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F), to the mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans, where the temperatures reach more than 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). Tigers haunt the ruins of buildings such as courts and temples and are at home in habitats ranging from dry grassland to rainforest. Grasslands, mixed grassland-forests, and deciduous rather than densely canopied forests support maximum population densities, as these habitats maintain the highest number of prey species. Having evolved in the temperate and subtropical forests of eastern Asia, the tiger is less tolerant of heat than other large cats, which may explain why it is an adept swimmer that appears to enjoy bathing. Under stress it may climb trees.\nSumatran tiger Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) in water. \u00a9 Digital Vision/Getty Images\nSee a herd of Sika deers feeding on fresh kelps and the Siberian tiger on a deer in the forest of eastern Russia Learn about the feeding habits of sikas and Siberian, or Amur, tigers. Contunico \u00a9 ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz See all videos for this article\nThe tiger usually hunts by night and preys on a variety of animals, but it prefers fairly large prey such as deer (sambar, chital, and swamp deer) and wild pigs. A special liking for porcupines, despite the danger of injury from their quills, is an exception. Healthy large mammals are generally avoided, although there have been recorded instances of the tiger\u2019s having attacked elephants and adult water buffalo. Cattle are occasionally taken from human habitations, and some tigers can thrive on domestic livestock. After making a kill and consuming what it can, it makes a deliberate attempt to hide the carcass from vultures and other scavengers so that another meal can be obtained. Tigers are not averse to commandeering a kill from other tigers or leopards, and they sometimes eat carrion. Skill in killing and obtaining prey is only partly instinctive, maternal training being essential for proficiency. For this reason, tigers raised in captivity would not fare well if released into the wild. As the top predator throughout its range, the tiger plays a major role in controlling not only its prey population but that of other predators such as the leopard, dhole (Asiatic wild dog), and clouded leopard. No trait of the tiger has fascinated humans more than man eating. A number of reasons account for this\u2014disability caused by age or injury, paucity of prey, acquisition of the habit from the mother, or defense of cubs or kill. With the reduction in the number of tigers, the occurrence of man-eating tigers has become rare except in the Sundarbans, the northeast Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, and neighbouring Nepal in and around Royal Chitwan National Park.\nAs solitary animals, tigers (especially males) establish and maintain their own territories, the size and nature of which vary with the number and distribution of prey, the presence of other tigers in the area, the nature of the terrain, the availability of water, and individual characteristics. Spacing between individuals and maintenance of territories are achieved through vocalization, scrapings on the ground, claw marking of trees, fecal deposits, scent deposited by the rubbing of facial glands, and spraying of urine mixed with scent secreted from the anal glands. The solitary nature of the species also helps minimize territorial conflict. Nonetheless, confrontations do occur, sometimes resulting in injury and even death.\nThe readiness of a tigress to mate is announced through vocalization and scent production. There is no fixed breeding season, though the preponderance of mating appears to occur in winter, with striped cubs being born after a gestation period of more than three months. The normal litter size is two to four, though up to seven cubs have been recorded. They are born blind, and, even when their eyes open, opacity prevents clear vision for six to eight weeks. There is thus a long period of weaning, tutelage, and training during which cub mortality is high, especially if food is scarce. During this time the offspring must endure long periods of absence by the mother while she is away hunting. Weaker cubs get less food because of the aggressiveness of their stronger siblings as food is less frequently made available. The cubs remain with the mother until about the second year, when they are nearly adult and are able to kill prey for themselves. Male cubs grow more quickly than females and tend to leave their mother earlier. Though cub infanticide (mainly by males) is known, it is not very unusual to find a male with a tigress and cubs, even sharing a kill. Such associations, however, do not last long. The tigress does not breed again until her cubs are independent. The average life span of a tiger in the wild is about 11 years."}

It wasn't until the late 1400's and early 1500's when explorers including Columbus, brought horses back to the new world.\nThe horses they reintroduced were Arabian and Spanish Barb horses, small, swift and tough.\nThey were accustomed to harsh desert environments, and quickly began to populate South, Central and North America, where they are known today as mustangs.\nSo mustangs did not originate in the Americas, and they were descended from domesticated horses.\nThis is why the mustang horse is considered a feral horse, not a wild horse.\nThis is an important distinction which has caused some controversy. As a feral species, the mustang does not receive the same protections it might get as a true wild native, and in the past, they have been treated as invasive and a pest.\nToday, there are approximately 50,000 mustang horses roaming free in the Western United States.\nMost are found on private land, sanctuaries and reservations.\nThe mustang is a breed of horse that tends to be of small size, but sturdy and strong-boned. They average just under 15 hands at the shoulder, and rarely top 900 pounds.\nMustangs are most often dun, grulla, roan or buckskin in color, although almost all colors and patterns are seen.\nThey have thick, brush-like manes and forelocks, and their eyes are set further on the sides of their heads than other breeds, giving them a distinctive look from straight on.\nThey live in groups of mares and foals, generally guarded by one stallion.\nYoung males, older stallions, and males that simply don't have the size or aggression level to compete for mares, live in small groups of bachelors.\nCompetition for mares is constant and highly stressful. A stallion must be on continual alert for rivals, and will attempt to ward them off.\nFights are very common and include strikes with the forefeet, kicks with the hindfeet, wrestling, headbutting and vicious biting.\nVictors will often down their opponent by rearing up and pushing them over. The loser is vanquished, and injuries are common, including gashes from hooves and teeth, and injured or even broken limbs.\nFighting to the death is rare, but death may occur sometime after the actual battle, from wounds received.\nThe bureau of land management manages several herds of wild mustangs, and conducts regular adoption events, where citizens can adopt a horse right off the range.\nMustangs properly trained and lovingly cared for make amazing riding horses and have even competed in high level competitions such as reining, barrel racing, endurance and even show jumping.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Spanning hundreds of millions of years, the Earth has played host to over nine million species of animal in every conceivable habitat. Today, over 1,5 million living animals have been identified and described, with new ones being added every day, while some sadly fall into extinction.\nBelonging to the biological kingdom of Animalia, animals can be defined as multicellular eukaryotic organisms (more than one cell, with each cell containing a nucleus within a membrane) that breathe oxygen, consume organic material, are able to move, and reproduce sexually. As you can imagine, with all the different sizes and shapes; ways to breathe like gills or lungs; diet like plants or meat; ways to move like swimming, slithering, flying, crawling, running and hopping; body coverings like scales, feathers, fur, shells and skin; laying eggs or giving birth to live young; creatures being warm-blooded or cold, the animal kingdom is not only huge, but massively varied.\nNo matter where you find an animal \u2013 whether that\u2019s the freezing cold of the Antarctic, the blistering Sahara desert, the sweltering tropics of the Amazon, the vast African savannah, to the darkest caves and deepest oceans, animals have evolved to be uniquely adapted to their environment, with each species having complex interactions with one another and playing an important role in the ecosystem and food chain they find themselves in.\nThrough zoology, the study of animals, we\u2019ve come to learn about the smallest insects, smaller than a millimetre, to the largest blue whales at over 100 feet long. With so many animals to study, we\u2019re still learning about many, which also means undoing human damage as a result of fear and misunderstanding. Today, we know that wolves and sharks are intelligent animals with complex social hierarchies and, while dangerous, are not monsters to be killed.\nBy learning about animals, we're able to enhance our own lives. Termites have taught us about architecture, horseshoe crabs may hold the secret to never being sick, gorillas and orangutans can help us understand our early origins, livestock like horses, cattle and sheep have provided us with textiles to keep warm, transport and food, fish have taught us about streamlined shapes, while birds and whales served as inspiration for mastering the skies and seas.\nIn every culture in the world, animals can be found at their heart as symbols of strength, fertility, power and even gods incarnate. It\u2019s easy to forget that we people are animals too, but it\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re part of the intricate web of life on Earth and it\u2019s our responsibility to look after every single creature that inhabits it.\nLearn more about fascinating animals from vertebrates to invertebrates, marine and land animals, mammals and reptiles in this section."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Seal Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Seal-facts.html", "text": "seal Facts\nPortrait of a Seal\nThe true seals, also known as the earless seals and the crawling seals, are over 18 species of semi-aquatic marine mammals of the family Phocidae. They are one of three families within the super family known as pinnipeds.\nPinniped means feather(pinni) foot(ped) in Latin. The other two families are the walrus, alone in its own genus, and the sea lions.\nSea lions and fur seals are known as eared seals or walking seals. True seals differ from sea lions in that they have no external ears, and are unable to walk on all-fours as the sea lions can.\nThe fur seals are also in the sea lion family and are not true seals, although they are called by the name \"seal\", but all the pinnipeds, seals, walruses and sea lions, are all seals, as lions and cheetahs and domestic cats are all cats. So it is not wrong to call a sea lion or a walrus a seal, just as it would not be wrong to call a jaguar or a mountain lion a cat, just a little less accurate.\nThe seals ancient ancestors were land animals, probably somewhat similar to otters.\nFor reasons unknown, these terrestrial creatures returned to the ocean about 20 million years ago, where they have since become the most successful and widely distributed family of carnivores in the world.\nSeals live mostly in very cold, often frozen environments, and their bodies are layered in blubber to protect them from the elements. Blood actually migrates to the exterior layers of blubber when the animal needs to cool down, and flows back to the interior layers, close to the bodies core, when the temperature is colder.\nThe body of a seal is specifically structured for life in the water, with a smooth, torpedo shaped torso, and flattened, powerful flippers, like four large swim fins instead of feet. In fact, the swim-fins scuba divers and backyard snorkelers use were modeled after the unique, compressed and web-toed feet of a seal.\nMost seal species live in very large social groups called colonies that may come together to sunbathe in masses of hundreds, and take to the beach to mate and raise young in tightly packed gatherings of thousands.\nOn land they are extremely cumbersome, and must move their often enormous bodies by wriggling almost like a worm. Some species move around by bouncing, some pull themselves forward with their front flippers, and many seals will also occasionally roll their bodies one or two revolutions to one side or the other if they wish to move short distances.\nIn the ocean though, seals swim with exceeding grace and swiftness, using all four flippers for both propulsion and steering. Some species can dive 1000 feet deep and remain submerged for over an hour.\nThey have larger volumes of blood and a greater concentration of oxygen in the blood than any land animals, and they expel all oxygen from their lungs before they dive, avoiding issues such as \"the bends\".\nIn dives as deep as 1000 feet and as long as 100 minutes, their special bodies survive on only the oxygen in their blood.\nseal lifestyle and reproduction\nThere are over 18 species of true seals, most of which display varying extents of sexual dimorphism - an obvious difference in appearance between males and females. Depending on the species, male seals can be larger than females by as much as five times, and in several species, such as the hooded and elephant seals, mature males have distinct pendulous noses and other facial features.\nSeals are highly social and desire close contact, but don't really have close relationships. They may move about among hundreds of other seals happily communing with dozens of individuals. Although they live in large groups seals are solitary hunters diving several hundred feet deep in search of fish, crustaceans and squid.\nLifestyle naturally varies among the many species, but seals, in general, are promiscuous, and males do not contribute to the raising of young. Seals migrate between breeding grounds and feeding grounds, traveling several hundred to up to two thousand miles a year.\nWhen females arrive at the breeding grounds, which are called rookeries, the males have already staked claims to prime areas, battling each other with loud roaring, charges and sometimes violent contests.\nFemales arrive already pregnant from the previous season, and give birth to one baby, called a pup, within a few days of arriving. After the birth of the baby the mother seal will remain on land for up to 6 weeks, nursing the pup till it is three times its birth weight.\nIn some species, such as the familiar harp seal, the mother fasts for a few weeks, doing nothing but nursing her newborn, then, after only 4 to 5 weeks, she leaves the pup for good, returning to the ocean to mate again.\nThe harp seal pups are snow white in color to camouflage them in their snowy environment, which is critical over the next week or two, as they begin to forage and fend for themselves.\nOther seals spend more time nurturing their young ones, but many species use this method of complete dedication by the mother for a few weeks and then basically a cold turkey abandonment.\nGroups of forlorn pups gather on beaches calling for their mothers and falling prey to killer whales, and polar bears. Eventually the strongest survivors take to the water and find their way to the feeding grounds which may be hundreds of miles away.\nwhat is the difference between seals and sea lions?\nseal on the beach\nsea lion running\nSea lions are members of the seal or pinniped family. The word pinniped means \"flipper feet\" or \"feather feet\" and includes three types of semi-aquatic marine mammals. The walrus, the \"true seals\" and the \"eared seals\" or \"walking seals\".\nThere are 7 species of sea lions and 9 species of fur seals that make up the \"earred seals\".\nEared seals differ from true seals in that they have external ears, larger, more powerful forelimbs, and can rotate their hind limbs forward and beneath them. These differences in skeletal structure allow the sea lion and fur seal to not only sit in a semi-upright position, (that classic pose), but also to walk and even run on all-fours.\nIn contrast, the rear limbs of true seals are fused together and are permanently facing rearward making walking impossible.\nAll pinnipeds, even walruses, are considered seals, in the same broad sense that leopards are considered cats, so it is not incorrect to call a sea lion a seal, just less precise.\nEared seals spend a great deal of time on land, breeding and sunning on the shores. With long, powerful front flippers, their natural position is upright with the chest raised off the ground. Their rear legs are two separate, front-facing flippers that can be rotated under the body, and they can rise up and move around with a two beat gate.\nAlso often referred to as the \"walking seals\", the eared seals can actually walk, and even run, quite rapidly when necessary.\nThe \"true seals\" have no external ear flaps, smaller front flippers and rearward facing hind limbs that are fused together into one scalloped flipper. They move across land by stretching their upper bodies out and arching their backs to pull themselves forward.\nTrue seals also swim differently from eared seals, getting most of their propulsion from their fused, tail-like rear flippers and undulating motions similar to a dolphin to propel themselves, while the eared seals use their strong front flippers as big, highly effective oars, appearing to fly through the water like birds.\nWalruses have skeletons designed more like the eared seals, but have no ears. They move like the true seals in the water, but like the eared seals on land, and so are somewhere in between these two groups, and are classified in a genus of their own. - Seal Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

These noses are multi-chambered and can be inflated with air to help the male make incredibly loud roars which intimidate rivals and impress females.\nThe female Southern elephant seal averages about 10 ft in total length, but the male Southern elephant seal averages 16 feet in length and weighs over 7000 pounds. The biggest adult males can be almost 20 feet long and top 8500 pounds.\nThe elephant seal is not only the largest pinniped, (way bigger than a walrus) but also the largest terrestrial carnivore, dwarfing such animals as African lions (826 pounds record weight) and polar bears,(2209 pounds record weight).\nFound on the beaches of New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa, the Southern elephant seal is land-bound for two separate one month long periods each year.\nFirst is mating season where males will remain on the beach and fast for weeks while establishing territories, and females will fast while feeding newborns. Males may battle fiercely during this time and things can get violent.\nMost adult male elephant seals have many scars from battles with sharp-toothed rivals. After breeding season, they return to the water to refuel, but then beach themselves again for molting season, where they return to their mating grounds to lounge about while they regrow their top layer of skin and fur in one 30 day marathon.\nElephant seals are the most adept deep sea divers of any pinniped capable of underwater excursions of 100 minutes or more without taking a breath. - Elephant Seal Facts\nelephant seal big bulls battle\nlife on the ice\nroaring leopard seal\nThe majority of seal species are located in some of the coldest environments in the world. Some species spend the majority of their lives on or under the Arctic ice cap coming up for air at strategic holes that they create themselves.\nSeals in these icy regions are well equipped with strong, sharp claws on their front flippers that they dig breathing holes with. They can maintain breathing holes through layers of ice up to 6 feet thick with constant tending.\nSome Arctic seals like the ringed seal, a staple of the polar bears diet, actually dig out caves in the snow that covers their breathing holes. They hollow out an area known as a lair, and under the snow cover they can come up out of the water.\nRinged seals raise their pups in the lairs and usually maintain more than one at a time so they can avoid predators. Polar bears have an astounding sense of smell, however, and can detect seals hiding in lairs.\nThe vastness of the Arctic is the seals best defense, but if a polar bear does discover its hiding spot, the ringed seal still has a good chance of escaping back down the breathing hole into the ocean water below before the bear can claw its way though the ceiling of hard packed snow from above.\nAnother notorious ice dwelling seal is the rather fierce leopard seal. These very unique seal species take some of the largest prey of all pinnipeds, such as penguins and other seal species.\nBut as impressive a hunter as they are, one of their dietary staples is the tiny invertebrate called krill. Leopard seals teeth are specially designed to sieve krill out of mouthfuls of sea water.\nThey are by far the most solitary of the seal species, living alone on the ice floes of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. The leopard seal earns its name with its spotted coat, its effective hunting style, and its often gaping mouthful of dagger sharp teeth.\nseals on ice - hunting and hunted\nall in the colony, all in the raft\nA group of seals on land is called a colony, and a group of seals in the water is called a raft.\nSeals can come together during breeding season and at certain popular breeding grounds in masses of hundreds, and sometimes thousands. Crowding is not a problem, in fact close body contact is desired by most seal species.\nThere is lots of lounging, floating, feeding and noisy discussion in the life of a seal. A raft of seals floating in the water may appear to be a larger creature to some predators who will think twice.\nSeals in water will regulate their body temperature by raising a flipper or tail out into the air. Many seal species spend equal amounts of time on land and sea, preferring isolated beaches, rocky outcrops and ice floats.\nPopular lounging areas are called \"haul outs\" or the term can be used to describe the activity, as in \"the seals are hauled out on the beach.\" Some species, such as elephant seals and leopard seals spend the majority of their lives in the water, only coming on land to molt once a year, and fight for breeding territory.\nMating itself takes place both on land and in the water, depending on species.\nMolting requires seals to remain on land where they can more easily regulate their temperature. Fur can be seen sloughing off seals and sea lions in huge chunks during this period.\nWhile human beings loose skin cells on a daily basis, and may replace 10 pounds of epidermis a year in tiny increments, molting involves the complete replacement of the epidermis skin and fur in the course of just a few weeks,\na few more seal facts\nSeals are known as the true seals, the earless seals or the crawling seals\nA male seal is called a bull, a female is called a cow, and a baby is called a pup\nA group of seals is called a colony on land, and a raft when in the water.\nThe male Southern elephant seal can grow to the size of a small truck weighing over 7000 pounds and measuring over 16 feet long.\nSome seals can stay underwater for up to an hour without taking a breath\nSeals replace their skin and their fur every year in one 30 day long molt.\nSeal the seal is a\ncarnivorous (meat-eating)\ndiurnal (awake during the day)\naquatic (lives in and near water)\npinniped(webbed digits)\nphocid (true seal family) mammal (animal with mammary glands and hair follicles)\nScientific Classification\nClass - Mammalia\nOrder - Carnivora\nGenus - Phocidae\nSpecies - phoca Seal Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow pup group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD colony, raft varied oceans fish, squid ENEMIES ENDANGERED TOP SPEED GENDER DIFFERENCE shark, orca polar bear threatened 25 mph Males often much larger LENGTH\nFEMALE WEIGHT FEMALE LENGTH MALE WEIGHT MALE 4 - 9 feet 130 - 1500 pounds 5 - 18 feet 200 - 8000 pounds ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH LENGTH BIRTH WEIGHT 1 x year 10 - 14 months 1 - 4 feet 10 - 50 pounds RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH EYES OPEN mother 1, rarely 2 furred, sighted at birth WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 12-16 months 2 years 4 - 10 years 10 - 30 years"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "What Is A White Lion And Where Are They Found? - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-white-lion-and-where-are-white-lions-found.html", "text": "The Timbavati area of South Africa holds 5,000 acres of land that are dedicated to the care of white lions. For a long time, it was assumed that white lions are indigenous to this part of the world only. The first white lion was spotted in this region in 1938, but it was not until the 1970s that these animals were brought to public attention. Currently, there are about three prides of white lions in Timbavati and numerous individuals in zoos across the world.\nWhat Is A White Lion?\nLions typically have hazel or golden-brown fur. However, in the case of white lions, the coat is entirely white or a very pale version of the usual fur color. The color of the fur can range anywhere from blonde to near-white. This coloration is inherited from the parents but is a recessive trait meaning that the likelihood of hazel-colored lion being born to hazel-colored lions is higher than that of a white lion. Similarly, breeding white lions can result in hazel-colored offspring.\nWhite Lions Versus Albino Lions\nAlbinism is the loss of the ability to generate melanin, a skin pigmentation that causes the dark coloration of the skin. White lions are not albinos, although many people are likely to call them \"albino lions.\" One other difference in appearance is that white lions have the usual pigment visible in the eyes, a blue-gray, hazel, green-gray or golden color, whereas albino lions would have a red tone to their eyes.\nHowever, white lions are leucistic, which refers to the reduction of multiple pigmentations and not just melanin. This trait results from a mild mutation of the enzyme that is responsible for the production of skin pigmentations. Severe mutation in this enzyme has been shown to cause albinism. Although albinism in lions exists, they are not the same as the white lions.\nNatural Habitat\nHundreds of white lions have been bred across the world, mostly in captivity. The Timbavati region in South Africa is often identified as the native home of the white lion. White lion trophy hunting had almost decimated the populations of this animal, but in 2006 there was an increase in the birth of white lions which has since brought a rise in population. This occurrence showed that the recessive trait that results in white lions was still present in the Timbavati region even after more than a decade of technical extinction. Like other lions, white lions are typically found in the savannah grasslands and hunt just like other lions.\nPopular Culture And Conservation Status\nThe white lion is held in high esteem by the local tribes in Timbavati. In these tribes, the white lion is regarded as a divine animal which reveals that the presence of white lions had been known long before their \"discovery\" in 1938. This animal is also a famous sight in zoos and circuses globally. Due to the rarity of the white lion, many were brought into captive breeding and enlisted in circuses. Adult white lions were no longer seen in their natural habitat in 1994, leading to the initiative to re-establish white lions in their natural habitat. This initiative was spearheaded by the Global White Lion Protection Trust (WLT), and from 2004 the trust has achieved tremendous milestones, like the official protected status of white lions. The white lion is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."}

This giant herbivore\u2013which is also known as a buffalo\u2013is the National Mammal of the United States.\nIn the late 18th Century over 60 million American bison roamed the grasslands of North America. As a result of over-hunting, by the end of the 19th century fewer than 1,000 bison remained. Conservation schemes have seen the species\u2019 population rise to around 13,000 mature individuals.\nYou can find out more about the American bison on this page: American Bison Facts\nReturn to page index\nAtlantic Horseshoe Crab / American Horseshoe Crab\nScientific name: Limulus polyphemus\nType of animal: Arachnid (or close relation)\nFamily: Limulidae\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nDespite its name, the Atlantic horseshoe crab isn\u2019t a true crab. In fact, recent studies have found it to be closely related to the arachnids, so much so that some zoologists consider it to be a member of this group.\nHorseshoe crabs are found off the North American coast from Maine to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Mexico. They emerge from the sea to breed at various times of the year, depending on location.\nThis ancient arthropod closely resembles horseshoe crabs that lived 445 million years ago; hundreds of millions of years before the dinosaurs appeared.\nYou can find out more about the Atlantic horseshoe crab on this page: Atlantic Horseshoe Crab Facts\nReturn to page index\nBald Eagle\nScientific name: Haliaeetus leucocephalus\nType of animal: Bird\nFamily: Accipitridae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nIf the American bison is the iconic mammal of North America, then the bald eagle is its avian counterpart. This large, white-headed raptor is found from northern Canada to northern Mexico. It is one of 10 species of genus Haliaeetus, a group of birds otherwise known as \u201csea eagles\u201d.\nThe bald eagle is usually found in wetlands and coastal habitats. In most regions its diet consists mainly of fish, but the species is an adaptable opportunistic predator and will also feed on birds, mammals and reptiles.\nYou can find out more about the bald eagle on this page: Bald Eagle Facts\nReturn to page index\nBighorn Sheep\nScientific name: Ovis canadensis\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Bovidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nSheep first arrived in North America around 750,000 years ago, when the animals crossed the Bering land bridge from Siberia. Since then, North American sheep have branched into two species: Dall sheep Ovis dalli, and the bighorn sheep.\nBighorn sheep are named for the large horns of the males (the females too have horns, but they are shorter and less curved). The males use their horns as \u201cbattering rams\u201d in ferocious fights for dominance within the herd prior to the mating season.\nBighorn sheep are found in mountainous, grassland and rocky habitats in western Canada, USA, and parts of Mexico.\nYou can find out more about the bighorn sheep on this page: Bighorn Sheep Facts\nReturn to page index\nBlack Bear\nScientific name: Ursus americanus\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Ursidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe black bear is the smallest of the three bear species native to North America, and the world\u2019s most common bear species. It is mainly found in forest habitats, and is present in Canada, the USA, and northern Mexico.\nThe black bear is an omnivore, changing its diet depending on its location and the season. As well as consuming a variety of plant matter (including roots and fruit), it will also eat eggs, insects, carrion and prey that it has captured itself.\nYou can find out more about the black bear on this page: Black Bear Facts\nReturn to page index\nBobcat\nScientific name: Lynx rufus\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Felidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe bobcat is one of four species of genus Lynx, and one of two lynxes found in North America (the other being the Canada lynx). Like all lynxes, the bobcat has a short tail and tufts of black hair on its ears.\nThe bobcat\u2019s diet is more varied than that of the Canada lynx, which feeds mainly on the snowshoe hare. Bobcats, as well as eating rabbits and hares, also hunts rodents and other mammals, birds, fish and insects.\nYou can find out more about the bobcat on this page: Bobcat Facts\nReturn to page index\nBrown Bear\nScientific name: Ursus arctos\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Ursidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe brown bear is found in Europe and Asia, as well as in North America. North American brown bears are commonly known as \u201cgrizzly bears\u201d, although sometimes this name is only used for brown bears that live inland, rather than coastal, locations.\nThe brown bear can be considered the world\u2019s largest land carnivore, because the polar bear (which can be larger) is semi-aquatic.\nLike most bears, the brown bear is omnivorous. It eats a variety of plant matter, as well as carrion and prey it has captured itself. Some of the very largest brown bears live in coastal locations with access to large numbers of migrating salmon.\nYou can find out more about the brown bear on this page: Brown Bear Facts\nReturn to page index\nBullfrog (American)\nScientific name: Lithobates catesbeianus\nType of animal: Amphibian\nFamily: Ranidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe American bullfrog is a large green frog found in lakes, ponds and other wetland habitats throughout much of North America. During the mating season male bull frogs make a bull-like below, which gives the species its name.\nLike all frogs, the bullfrog is carnivorous. The species preys on a wide variety of invertebrates and vertebrates (by no means a fussy eater, the American bullfrog will devour most animals it can fit inside its mouth).\nChipmunk (Eastern)\nScientific name: Neotamias minimus\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Sciuridae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe eastern chipmunk is one of around 25 small mammals in the squirrel family (Sciuridae) that are known as chipmunks.\nThe eastern chipmunk is found in deciduous woodlands and parks in the eastern United States and southern Canada.\nDuring the winter months, the eastern chipmunk stays in its burrow in a state of semi-hibernation known as torpor.\nCoyote\nScientific name: Canis latrans\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Canidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe coyote is a member of the dog family Canidae native to North America. It is found in grasslands, forests and deserts. Unlike its larger cousin the wolf, the coyote is able to tolerate the presence of humans, and can be found living close to towns.\nCoyotes are opportunistic feeders, preying on a variety of small to mid-sized animals, and also eating carrion and finding food in trash. Coyotes have few predators, but may fall victim to larger predators such as mountain lions and wolves.\nYou can find out more about the coyote on this page: Coyote Facts\nReturn to page index\nElk\nScientific name: Cervus canadensis\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Cervidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe elk, also known as the wapiti, is one of the largest members of the deer family Cervidae. The species is found in forests and grasslands in North America and Asia.\nSeveral elk subspecies exist in North America, the largest of which is the Roosevelt elk. This subspecies can reach a shoulder height of around 5.6 ft (1.7 m) and a weight of up to 1,100 lb. (500 kg). It is found mainly in the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.\nYou can find out more about the elk on this page: Elk Facts\nReturn to page index\nGila Monster\nScientific name: Heloderma suspectum\nType of animal: Reptile\nFamily: Helodermatidae\nConservation status: Near Threatened\nThe Gila monster is a lizard found in desert regions of the southwestern United States, including both the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts. It has a distinctive orange / yellow and black markings and bead-like scales.\nThe Gila monster is one of two venomous lizards found in North America (the other being the closely-related Mexican beaded lizard). Despite the lizard\u2019s fearsome reputation, the Gila monster\u2019s bite, although painful, is not deadly to healthy humans.\nGroundhog / Woodchuck\nScientific name: Marmota monax\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Sciuridae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nAlso known as the woodchuck, the groundhog is a large burrowing rodent found across much of Canada and the eastern United States.\nAccording to Pennsylvanian folklore, if a groundhog sees its shadow upon emerging from its burrow on February 2nd, winter will continue for another six weeks. The Bill Murray film Groundhog Day, based upon this myth, made the groundhog one of the best-known North American animals.\nLike all rodents, the groundhog\u2019s incisor teeth continue to grow throughout the animal\u2019s lifetime, allowing it to gnaw on tough vegetation with no fear of its teeth eventually wearing down.\nHellbender\nScientific name: Cryptobranchus alleganiensis\nType of animal: Amphibian\nFamily: Cryptobranchidae\nConservation status: Near Threatened\nGrowing to 29 in. (74 cm) in length and 5.5 lb. (2.5 kg) in weight, the hellbender is the largest amphibian found in North America, and the fourth largest in the world. It inhabits fast-flowing, well-oxygenated rivers and streams in the eastern United States, and feeds mainly on crayfish and small fish.\nUnlike many other amphibians, the hellbender remains fully aquatic even in its adult form. Although in its adult form it has lungs, it \u201cbreathes\u201d mainly through its skin.\nKit Fox\nScientific name: Vulpes macrotis\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Canidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe kit fox is a small fox found in deserts and other dry habitats in the southwestern United States and Mexico. The fox\u2019s large ears not only provide the animal with acute hearing, but also a means to dissipate body heat. This is an adaptation for keeping the kit fox cool in the desert heat.\nYou can find out more about the kit fox on this page: Kit Fox Facts\nReturn to page index\nMonarch Butterfly\nScientific name: Danaus plexippus\nType of animal: Insect\nFamily: Nymphalidae\nConservation status: Currently unrated rated by the IUCN\nThe monarch butterfly is a member of the subfamily Danainae, a group of insects otherwise known as \u201cmilkweed butterflies\u201d on behalf of their favored food plants.\nThis common orange-winged North American butterfly is known for its long-distance migrations. During the fall, individuals can travel hundreds, if not thousands, of miles from the USA and Canada to Mexico and other southern destinations.\nYou can find out more about the monarch butterfly on this page: Monarch Butterfly Facts\nReturn to page index\nMoose\nScientific name: Alces alces\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Cervidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nWith large individuals having shoulder heights of around 6.9 ft.

This slow-moving mammal spends much of its life in the trees, and is mainly active at night.\nLike all porcupines, the North American porcupine has a coat of sharp quills. The quills, which are actually modified hairs, serve as a defense against predators.\nYou can find out more about the North American porcupine on this page: North American Porcupine Facts\nReturn to page index\nVirginia Opossum\nScientific name: Didelphis virginiana\nType of animal: Mammal (Marsupial)\nFamily: Didelphidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe Virginia opossum (also known as the North American opossum), is a cat-sized marsupial found in North America from Costa Rica to southern Canada. It is the only marsupial found in the USA and Canada, and is found further north than any other marsupial.\nLike other marsupials, the Virginia opossum gives birth to relatively undeveloped young, who then undergo further development in a special pouch in the mother\u2019s body.\nThe Virginia opossum, as well as inhabiting forests and scrublands, can also be found in urban areas. This nocturnal animal will often scavenge for food in gardens and back yards.\nYou can find out more about the Virginia opossum on this page: Virginia Opossum Facts\nReturn to page index\nPolar Bear\nScientific name: Ursus maritimus\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Ursidae\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nThe polar bear is, on average, the largest member of the bear family Ursidae, although some brown bears (notably the Kodiak bear subspecies) reach larger sizes. The polar bear is easily recognizable due to its white coat, which provides camouflage and insulation. Although the coat appears white, the hairs are actually colorless and hollow.\nThe polar bear\u2019s primary prey is ringed and bearded seals. It spends much of its life swimming and for this reason is considered a marine mammal.\nYou can find out more about the Polar Bear on this page: Polar Bear Facts\nReturn to page index\nPronghorn\nScientific name: Antilocapra americana\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Antilocapridae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe pronghorn, despite being known as the \u201cpronghorn antelope\u201d is not a true antelope. Neither, despite its appearance, is it a member of the deer family. In fact, the pronghorn is the only remaining member of the family Antilocapridae; its closest living relations are giraffes and okapis.\nThe pronghorn is North America\u2019s fastest land animal, and the world\u2019s second fastest, after the cheetah. It is thought that the pronghorn\u2019s ancestors evolved their great speed to escape predators such as the American cheetah.\nYou can find out more about the pronghorn on this page: Pronghorn Facts\nReturn to page index\nRaccoon\nScientific name: Procyon lotor\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Procyonidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nWith its black and white face mask and ringed tail the raccoon is one of the most familiar animals of North America. It is the largest member of the raccoon family, Procyonidae, which also includes animals such as coatis and the kinkajou.\nOriginally a forest animal, the raccoon\u2013which is known for its intelligence\u2013has adapted to live in urban areas. This nocturnal animal is an omnivore whose varied diet includes eggs, insects, small vertebrates and the discarded remains of human food.\nYou can find out more about raccoons on this page: Raccoon Facts\nReturn to page index\nWestern Diamondback Rattlesnake\nScientific name: Crotalus atrox\nType of animal: Reptile\nFamily: Viperidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThere are currently 36 recognized species of rattlesnake, most of which are found in North America. All belong to the subfamily Crotalinae, a group of venomous snakes known as pit vipers. Pit vipers possess a special heat-sensing organ located in a pit between the eye and nostril on each side of the head.\nThe western diamondback rattlesnake is the second-largest rattlesnake after the closely-related eastern diamondback rattlesnake. Most adult western diamondbacks reach 120 cm (4 ft) in length and exceptionally large individuals reach lengths of over 6.5 ft. (2 m). The species is responsible for more snakebites in the U.S. than any other snake.\nGreater Roadrunner\nScientific name: Geococcyx californianus\nType of animal: Bird\nFamily: Cuculidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe greater roadrunner is one of two roadrunners (the other being the lesser roadrunner). Both are members of the cuckoo family Cucolidae.\nThe greater roadrunner is found in desert and other arid habitats in the southwestern United States and Mexico.\nAlthough the roadrunner can fly, it spends most of the time on the ground. It is capable of reaching speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) or more, and can move faster on land than any other bird that is also able to fly.\nThe greater roadrunner preys on a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate animals. It\u2019s even capable of preying on small rattlesnakes, tarantulas, and the fearsome tarantula hawk wasp.\nWolf\nScientific name: Canis lupus\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Canidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe wolf, or gray wolf to give the species its full name, is the largest member of the dog family Canidae. Many zoologists consider the domestic dog to be a subspecies of gray wolf.\nWild wolves are found in North America, Europe and Asia. In North America, wolves are generally found in wilderness areas well away from human settlements. Wolves hunt in packs comprising an alpha pair and their offspring. Hunting as a pack allows the group to bring down prey as large as bison, moose and elk.\nWolfes are famous for their nighttime howls. Howling is used to mark territory, to warn other members of the pack of potential danger, and to bring the pack together prior to a hunt.\nYou can find out more about the wolf on this page: Wolf Facts\nReturn to page index\nNorth American Animals List: Discover More with Active Wild\nDiscover more amazing animals on the following pages:"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "9 Fascinating Facts About Seals - Treehugger", "url": "https://www.treehugger.com/seal-facts-5092292", "text": "Seals, also known as pinnipeds, make up three diverse groups of semi-aquatic carnivorous marine mammals. Constituting the most species-rich clade of living marine mammals, there are 33 types of seals widely distributed around the world, dating back to the late Oligocene (27-25 million years ago) period according to fossil records, with more than 50 species existing at one point in time.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\nThe three subclades of pinniped include Phocidae, or true seals, Otariidae, or fur seals and sea lions, and Odobenidae, with only one remaining species, the walrus. The earliest pinnipeds were aquatic carnivores with well-developed, paddle-shaped limbs and feet, and likely went through a freshwater-dwelling phase during their transition from land-living to spending the bulk of their time in the ocean.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeffRead on to learn more about these adorable marine animals.\n1. Seals Are Related to Bears, Skunks, and Badgers\nEvolutionary biologists have been arguing over seals' origins for more than a century. While relatively sure that pinnipeds evolved from land-dwelling carnivores, scientists are divided on the precise steps that occurred between terrestrial ancestors and modern marine mammals. Along with the three subclades of pinniped, the suborder Caniformia contains Ursidae (bears), Mustelidae (badgers, otters, weasels, and relatives), and Mephitidae (skunks and stink badgers).\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff In 2007, a nearly complete skeleton of a new semi-aquatic carnivore from an early Miocene lake deposit in Nunavut, Canada, was discovered and became known as an evolutionary link between land mammals and seals.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n2. \"Earless\" True Seals Actually Do Have Ears\nJan Vrzina / EyeEm / Getty Images\nSeals' ability to hear can vary between species. \"Earless\" seals lack an external ear flap, present on fur seals and sea lions, but they still have ears present beneath the surface of the skin. True seals (phocids) hear higher frequencies under water than otariids (fur seals and sea lions), and the opposite is true for airborne sounds. All pinnipeds are more sensitive to underwater sounds than they are to airborne sounds.\n3. The Largest Seal Weighs More Than Four Tons\nJoseph Leahy / Getty Images\nA male southern elephant seal has an average weight of 8,000 pounds while females are much smaller.\ufeff\ufeff This drastically contrasts the smallest seal in the family of otariids, the Galapagos fur seal, which ranges between 60 to 140 pounds on average.\ufeff\ufeff Almost all seals, with the exception of the nearly-hairless walrus, are covered in thick fur, and have layers of fat to keep them warm called blubber.\n4. Mothers and Pups Bond With a Unique Call\nSmith Collection/Gado / Getty Images\nResearchers performed vocalization playback experiments on 18 breeding female harbor seals to assess their abilities to recognize calls of their pup and to evaluate the effect of maternal protectiveness. They found that mothers were more responsive to the calls of their own pup than to non-filial pups after only three days. Mother seals' responses also varied depending on their protective behavior displayed towards their pup. And species of seals in which the young are more mobile and the colonies are more dense are more likely to strongly develop vocal recognition abilities.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n5. They Have \"Smokers' Blood\" To Help Survive Deep Dives\nBoth seals and heavy human smokers have high levels of carbon monoxide in their blood streams. While humans acquire it from burning tobacco, researchers think seals' blood carbon monoxide levels are connected to their deep dives. One study found that elephant seals' blood is around 10% carbon monoxide, which researchers attribute to the animals holding their breaths for about 75% of their lives. Exhaling is the only way for an animal to clear carbon monoxide from its body.\ufeff\ufeff\n6. The Baikal Seal Is the World's Only Freshwater Pinniped\nWestend61 / Getty Images\nOne of the smallest true seals, the Baikal represents the seal's evolutionary journey from terrestrial to semi-aquatic, when seals likely spent time in freshwater before making their transition from land to oceans. Lake Baikal, a freshwater lake in Siberia is home to a whole host of interesting creatures, and is both the oldest, and deepest, lake on the planet.\ufeff\ufeff\n7. Their Brain Temperature Drops When They Dive\nResearch on hooded seals illustrated a drop in brain temperature by 3 degrees Celsius over the course of a fifteen minute dive, in a process designed to reduce oxygen consumption by the brain. The seals circulated cold blood to the brain through the large superficial veins from their front flippers, ultimately reducing the brain's oxygen demand by an estimated 15-20%. This extends a seal's diving capacity substantially, and provides additional protection against hypoxic injury.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n8. They Can Eat A Lot of Seafood\nMatt Cardy / Getty Images\nBecause seals are typically found along coastlines, they primarily consume fish, squid, and shrimp, as well as other crustaceans, mollusks, and zooplankton organisms. Researchers theorize that their terrestrial ancestors were insectivores.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Larger seals can eat 10 pounds of food per day. As some populations have increased in recent decades, researchers are carefully studying the impact on seal's prey, including salmon, and encouraging management practices that protect both seals and potentially threatened fisheries.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n9. Climate Change Is Their Newest Threat\nIn the last century, both the Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct, the latter considered a harbinger of human-caused extinction in coral reef systems. Historically, seals have faced threats from hunting, accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff More recently, seals face a new threat in the form of habitat loss as a result of climate change. Arctic-dwelling bearded and ringed seals are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act because their sea-ice habitat is melting. Advocacy groups are working to envision shifting habitats for these animals as the climate changes.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lions Of Africa- Physical Characteristics - Chakarov", "url": "http://www.chakarov.com/studentswork/lions/physical.html", "text": "Physical Characteristics\nThe lion is a member of the cat family, and shares many common traits of this family.\nThe body is very muscular, with less bone mass than other animals of comparable size. This is also responsible for the grace of movement we associate with members of the cat family. The forebody of the lion is very powerfully built, and has the greatest forebody strength of any cat, except possibly the tiger. This enables the lion to deliver blows with it's forepaws heavy enough to break a zebra's back.\nPaws\nEach paw is equipped with soft pads to make it's movements quiet.\nLike most carnivores, lions are digitigrade walkers. This means they essentially walk on their toes. Extra bones in the toe joints give the toes a wide range of motion.\nThe claws are retractible and very sharp. The retractable feature helps keep the claws sharp, and prevents injury during play, etc.\nThe dewclaw on the front limbs is often used as a toothpick. The claws grow as a series of layers. As a layer wears, it is shed, and a new sharp-pointed claw is exposed. The claw on a large lion can be 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) or more from base to tip along the curve.\nBody\nThe body is covered with a sandy brown coat in most subspecies of lions, but there is a white variant that shows up once in a while, especially in the Timbavati region of South Africa. (The white variant is also showing up more and more among captive lion populations.) Lions with a very dark brown coat have been observed, but this is quite rare.\nThe coat color of a lion is not determined so much by the color of the hair, but by the ratio of light-colored hairs to dark-colored hairs.\nMane\nThe mature male lion has a mane that covers the backside of the head, and the shoulders.\nThe extent of the mane varies from individual to individual, with some having no mane at all, while others have a luxurious mane that runs onto the body, along the abdomen, and even onto the fronts of the back legs in exceptional specimins. The mane varies in colour from the rest of the body, and tends to grow darker with age.\nSome lions in the Serengeti area and from North Africa have a nearly black mane. Just like the body hair, the mane color is determined by the ratio of dark hairs to light hairs present. The mane hair is stiff and wiry, like stiff horeshair.\nBesides it's primary role of protecting the male during fights, it has been discovered that female lions prefer males with bigger and darker manes.\nEyes\nThe eyes are proportinately larger than in other comparable-sized animals, and posess round pupils. Lions, like most cats, are visual animals.\nThe eyes are also well-adapted for use under very low light. This helps the lion hunt at night.\nContrary to popular notion, a lion's eyes do not glow in the dark, but they contain a special reflective coating that will reflect even moonlight.\nA white circle just below the eyes helps reflect light into the eyes to further improve night vision.\nLike most mammals, lions have a nictitating membrane which serves to clean and protect the eye in some circumstances. Lions, like most cats, have limited ability to move their eyes side-to-side, and must turn the head to look in a different direction.\nSenses\nThe sense of smell is well developed.\nLions mark their territories by means of scent deposits, necessitating a good sense of smell. This also helps them find kills made by other predators, and perhaps obtain an easy meal by driving the other predator off their kill.\nAnother interesting thing that lions and all other cats posess is a special olfactory organ on the roof of the mouth called a Jacobson's organ. Sometimes, you will see a lion, or even your cat, grimace when smelling something. They are opening their lips to draw air over their jacobson's organs. This grimacing gesture is called Flehmen. The sense of hearing is perhaps only slightly above average. The ears can be swiveled over a wide angle to enable the lion to hear distant sounds, and know what direction they are coming from.\nTail\nThe lion's tail is the only one in the cat family with a tassel at the tip. (Ligers also have a tassel, but they are not found in the wild.) This tassel conceals a spine, which is the last few tail bones fused together. What function this spine serves, if any, is unknown.\nThe tail is very important for overall balance.\nFemales also use their raised tail as a 'follow me' signal for the cubs. They also use it to signal each other during a group hunt.\nTeeth\nThe lion's teeth are well adapted for killing their prey and eating it.\nThe great canine teeth are spaced such that they can slip between the cervical vertebrae of their favorite-sized prey animals, and sever the spinal cord. The shape of the back teeth, which are called carnassals instead of molars, makes them work like a pair ofscissors, for cutting pieces of meat.\nThe jaw is not capable of moving side-to-side, like ours. This helps keep the carnassal teeth in alingment for cutting.\nThe rest of the teeth are conical, and designed for cutting and tearing. Lions, like all cats, do not chew their food, but swallow it in chunks. They also use only one side of their mouth at a time.\nThis trait is also common to all cats, and is caused by the inability of the jaw to move side-to-side. The tongue is covered with rough spines, called papialle. This helps the lion scrape meat off of bones, and acts like a comb for grooming.\nRoar\nNo physical description of the lion would be complete without some mention being made about it's magnificent roar.\nOnly four cats can roar: The lion, tiger, leopard, and jaguar.\nThese four cats have been assigned to the genus Panthera because they can roar. Of these cats, the lion roars the most. It is believed the roar serves to alert other lions of an individual's presence.\nRoaring choruses of several lions, or a whole pride, also take place.\nWhen a lion roars, it can do so with enough force to raise a cloud of dust.\nRoaring is made possible by a special two-piece hyoid bone in the throat.\nAll of the non-roaring cats have a one-piece hyoid bone.\nIt is said that a lion's roar can be heard 5 miles (8 km) away."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "African Lion | Zoo Atlanta", "url": "https://zooatlanta.org/animal/african-lion/", "text": "African lions are unique among cats in that they live in social groups called prides. Prides hunt together to bring down moderate to large-sized prey, which is shared with all members of the group according to strict social rules.\nScientific name: Panthera leo\ndiet: Carnivore\nrange: Eastern Africa, Middle Africa, Southern Africa, Western Africa [VIEW MAP]\nhabitat: Forests, Grasslands\nViewing Hints:\nThe lions at Zoo Atlanta may typically be seen year-round, except during the coldest or rainiest days, when they may choose to spend time in their indoor night areas.\nPhotos and Videos\nGeneral Information:\nLions prey mostly on grazing or browsing animals such as zebra, various species of antelope or even wildebeest. The entire animal is consumed except for the largest bones. Like all cats, lions have specialized tongues with sharp, rasping structures called papillae. These are used to clean bits of meat off of bones, as well as for grooming. Lions are strict carnivores; however, a steady diet of pure meat does not constitute a balanced diet. Lions receive additional nutrients by consuming organs, such as the liver and kidneys, and smaller bones, as well as by eating the prey\u2019s digestive tract.\nPhysical Features and Characteristics:\nLions are large cats with short, golden brown coats. Their long tails typically have a tuft of black hair at the end. Their weights range from about 250 pounds for females to about 450 pounds for males. Lengths range from 5 to 7 feet, with an extra 2 to 3 feet of tail.\nThe jaws are exceptionally powerful, with robust incisors for maintaining a grip on struggling prey that may be larger than the lion itself. The rear teeth are few in number and have a specialized structure, called carnassial teeth, which work like scissors to slice through tough muscle, hide or connective tissue.\nAfrican lions can run up to 37 miles per hour and can tackle prey that greatly outweighs them. Lions are sexually dimorphic. In addition to the weight differences between males and females, males have large manes. Manes start to grow when young males are approximately one year of age and grow thicker, longer, and darker as a male matures. Males generally have a full mane by 4 to 6 years of age. In addition to serving as a visual signal to other lions about the physical status of a male, the thick mane around the throat also protects males from the bites of rival males during male\u2013male combat for territories or mates.\nLifestyle and Reproduction:\nLions are the only truly social cats. They live in groups called prides which consist of six to seven individuals on average. The largest prides observed consist of up to 40 individuals. All females in a pride are typically related, and outsiders of either gender are not tolerated.\nA lion\u2019s roar can be heard from up to 5 miles away and is used to communicate territory possessions, aggression or other information to pride members and outside lions.\nBecause lions kill only when they are hungry, potential prey animals have the ability to judge the behavior of a lion pride and will approach them at relatively close proximity when they sense that they are not in hunting mode. Hunting is an organized event that is carried out by the females of the pride, typically overnight. During the dry season, lions often lie close to a water hole, waiting for prey to come for a drink. Although the females are the ones to hunt, the dominant male is the first to eat. Male lions also will hunt on occasion. Lions are typically only successful in 25% of their attempted hunts.\nMales spend most of their lives without a pride, so they have to be effective hunters on their own. It is common for young, outsider males to intrude upon a pride and fight with the dominant male for rights to his pride. As a result, males are only dominant over a pride for roughly two to three years. An intruding male will kill any existing cubs within the pride so that females will come into estrus again, usually within two to three weeks, to bear his cubs. Males from the same litter often stay together and will take over prides together. As a result, there often may be more than one adult male in a pride. One of these males might be dominant to his brothers, but the brothers also have opportunities to breed because females within a pride often cycle around the same time.\nPreviously dominant males who are expelled from a pride by a younger newcomer usually are solitary or will form loose groups of aging bachelors. It is often these older males who are involved in incidences of human\u2013lion conflict. Without the benefit of a pride, aging lions will often seek easier prey items such as domestic livestock.\nLions are sexually mature by 2 years old, but males may not have the opportunity to mate until they are closer to 5 years old. They are polygamous, with the dominant male of the pride breeding with multiple females in the group. There is no specific breeding season, and cubs are produced roughly every two years. The average gestation is between three and four months, and litter size usually ranges from one to four cubs.\nFemales in a pride often give birth around the same time, and the offspring are raised in cr\u00e8ches with females helping to raise multiple litters together. Cubs exhibit dark spots on their coats for their first few months. The young are weaned at about 8 months of age but will stay with their mothers for about two years.\nThe lions at Zoo Atlanta may typically be seen year-round, except during the coldest or rainiest days, when they may choose to spend time in their indoor night areas.\nRange:\nSub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), primarily in national parks and reserves of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem.\nHabitat:\nAfrican lions live in savanna woodland systems and sometimes in deserts.\nDiet:\nIn the wild, lions prey upon a wide variety of hoofed species such as zebra or antelopes. Lion hunting needs vary depending on the needs of the pride and the size of prey they are able to kill. If a pride is able to hunt large prey items, they may not eat every day. A male lion can eat up to one quarter of his weight in one sitting. Working together, a pride can be capable of bringing down a smaller or weakened individual giraffe or elephant, but this is not common. Smaller animals such as rabbits are also eaten.\nAt the Zoo, the lions are offered specially-prepared food made from an entire beef carcass. Once weekly the lions receive knuckle bones, which helps clean their teeth and provides enrichment.\nEnrichment:\nCats in general seem to enjoy batting items around with their paws and chewing on them. Lions are no exception, but their enrichment items have to be substantially sturdy to withstand the enormous strength of the claws and jaws. At Zoo Atlanta, lions are offered large items such as hard-plastic balls and empty kegs. Because novel scents are of special interest to them, the lions are also offered a variety of scented oils and extracts for enrichment."}

And boy, can they hunt! First, they use their exceptional eyesight to scan their surroundings before quietly stalking their chosen prey. Then, when the time is right, they sprint from cover, knock down their victim and kill it with a bite to the throat.\n7) As sprinting at such mega speeds uses a lot of energy, a cheetah chase is usually limited to 200-300m, and lasts less than a minute.\n8) Social animals, cheetahs are usually found in groups, consisting of either a mother and her young, siblings (who stay together for around six months after leaving the mother) or a coalition of males who live and hunt together. Adult females, however, tend to be solitary and only meet with males to mate.\n9) Females usually give birth to between two to eight cubs at a time. She nurses her youngsters in a lair hidden by tall vegetation, until they are 16 to 24 months old and able look after themselves.\n10) Sadly, this beautiful animal is threatened by loss of habitat and prey, as well as conflict with humans. As a result, the cheetah is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red list, and, today, an estimated 9,000-12,000 remain in Africa.\nPicture credits\nCheetah family in grass: Chris Johns.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Mountain Lions in California", "url": "https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Mammals/Mountain-Lion", "text": "Conservation and Management The Department strives to conserve mountain lion populations for their ecological and intrinsic values. To meet this goal, staff and our partners work to: Maintain genetically diverse and demographically viable populations;\nMinimize conflicts between mountain lions and humans (e.g., public safety events, property damage);\nIdentify and protect important habitats; and\nImprove public awareness of mountain lions; and\nIdentify and research emerging issues that threaten mountain lion populations or the habitats upon which they depend. Research indicates a lack of genetic diversity in specific areas of California (Ernest et al. 2014) as a result of human population growth and barriers that restrict connectivity with other mountain lion populations. The Department is pursuing many actions toward managing mountain lions, including coordination with federal, state, and non- governmental organization partners on projects to improve habitat connectivity, and to increase public outreach and education. In July 2019, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Mountain Lion Foundation petitioned the Fish and Game Commission to list mountain lions as a candidate species under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) within a proposed evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) located in Southern California and the central coast of California. In April 2020, the Commission found that listing of this ESU may be warranted and designated mountain lion within the ESU as a candidate species. As a result, CDFW is now completing a 12-month status review of mountain lions within the proposed ESU. At the end of the review, CDFW will make its recommendation on listing to the Commission. Under CESA, species classified as a candidate species are afforded the same protection as listed species. As a result, mountain lions in this proposed ESU are CESA-protected during the review period.\nScience and Research The Department conducts statewide research for the conservation and management of mountain lions in California. Currently Permitted Research Projects\nCalifornia Mountain Lion Research Publications Mountain Lion Research Permits CDFW is responsible for permitting and overseeing all mountain lion research in the State. Qualified individuals, educational institutions, governmental agencies or nongovernmental organizations may apply for a Scientific Collecting Permit (SCP) to conduct this research. The Department may authorize permitholders to pursue, capture, temporarily possess, temporarily injure, mark, attach to or surgically implant monitoring or recognition devices in, provide veterinary care to, and transport, mountain lions, or any part or product of a mountain lion. Prospective researchers must submit a research proposal using a clear, bulleted format to facilitate the expeditious processing of the SCP request. Learn more! Executive Summary; Need Statement; Goals; Time-oriented Objectives; Study Area (include a map if applicable) Methods; List of Personnel that details roles and responsibilities; and Statement of how your project complies with the following criteria: Contribute to the knowledge of natural wildlife ecosystems.\nMinimize disruptions in the lives and movements of mountain lions and other wildlife, as well as impacts to mountain lion or other wildlife habitat, while maintaining the permitholder's research objectives.\nDirectly or indirectly support the sustainability and survival of mountain lion populations and healthy ecosystems.\nPrevent the permanent injury or killing of any mountain lion. If portions of any proposal contains intellectually confidential information (e.g., novel capture methodology), such information should be included in the appendix under a confidentiality statement heading that shall read: \"The following information is a trade secret and should be exempt from public disclosure under the California Public Records Act pursuant to sections 6254(k) and 6276.44 of the Government Code.\" The proposal must still provide sufficient descriptive information, and simply reference this appendix when and where appropriate. 30-day Public Notices of Authorized Research Permits The Department shall notify the public of the intent to issue a Scientific Collecting Permit (SCP) for mountain lion research 30 days prior to permit issuance, pursuant to Fish and Game Code Section 4810. As of July 2019, CDFW has no pending SCP Permits for mountain lion research. Draft permit copies are available for review upon written request: California Department of Fish and Wildlife\nWildlife Branch \u2013 MOUNTAIN LION SCP\n1812 Ninth Street\nSacramento, CA 95811\nLaws and Regulations The passage of the California Wildlife Protection Act of 1990 (Proposition 117) by California voters established that mountain lions are a \"specially protected mammal\" in California. It is unlawful to possess, transport, import or sell any mountain lion or part or product thereof (including taxidermy mounts). Specimen Possession / Taxidermy No person may sell or possess any mountain lion, part or product thereof, unless s/he is in possession of a valid, nontransferable permit issued by the department. A permit shall be issued by CDFW with the following stipulations: Any person who can demonstrate that the mountain lion, part or product thereof, was in his/her possession on or before June 6, 1990; or A nonprofit museum or government-owned facility generally open to the public, or an educational institution, for display, exhibition, or storage, for a bona fide scientific or educational purpose as determined by the department. Permits shall be made available to department staff for inspection, upon request, and may be revoked by the department for failure to comply with the terms of the permit, this section, or Section 4800 of the Fish and Game Code. Any person issued a permit or a tag from the department for a mountain lion, or part or product thereof, prior to January 1, 2014, shall not be required to obtain a new permit, provided s/he maintains and makes available his existing permit or tag upon request of a department employee. Permit Application Requirements\nPotential Conflict and Public Safety Human-wildlife conflicts are reported in urban and rural communities throughout California. As communities expand into wildland areas, increasingly reported interactions between people and mountain lions has resulted in increased calls for assistance from the public. Human population growth in the urban/wildland interface has manifested in small land parcels, many of which contain pets, small livestock, poultry, or exotic animals. These factors can lead to potential conflict due to increased attractants and competition for resources. Cases where mountain lions threaten people are immediately addressed. In cases when pets or livestock are killed by mountain lions, a stepwise decision-making process is used to issue mountain lion depredation permits, pursuant provisions in Proposition 117 (Fish and Game Code Sections 4800-4810). CDFW has developed strategies to address the risk of mountain lions on the landscape using diverse tools and the best available science.\nHighly trained scientific and law enforcement staff address all cases of human conflicts with mountain lions. Training is a necessary part of an effective response to reported conflict.\nCommunication, education, and outreach are important to enhancing the public\u2019s understanding of potential conflict, conservation, and safe coexistence.\nFor more information, visit the Human-Wildlife Conflicts Program webpage and Keep Me Wildlife. The Department receives hundreds of mountain lion sighting reports each year. Few sightings result in a mountain lion being identified as an imminent threat to public safety and killed under CDFW Wildlife Public Safety Guidelines. Most reports are resolved by providing species information and/or technical assistance. Verified Mountain Lion-Human Attacks"}

Check out our ten top chimpanzee facts\u2026\nFast chimpanzee facts\nPhylum: Chordata\nFamily name: Hominidae\nClassification: Mammal\nIUCN status: Endangered\nLifespan (in wild): 45 years\nWeight: 32-60kg\nHeight: 1-1.7m when stood up straight\nDiet: Omnivore\nHabitat: Tropical forests and woodland savannahs\nRange:\n1) Chimpanzees are one of our planet\u2019s \u2018great apes\u2019, along with gorillas and orangutans. They have long arms that extend below their knees, short legs and black hair covering almost their entire body. Their faces are flat with big eyes, a small nose and a wide mouth.\n2) These amazing animals live in the tropical forests and woodland savannahs of West and Central Africa. Today, populations are fragmented, with the largest groups found in Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon.\n3) Did you know the DNA (the material that determines how a living thing will look and function) of chimps and humans is 98.5% the same? That\u2019s how closely related we are! As a result, we share many similar features, such as expressive faces, big toes and hands that can grasp. We also show similar behaviours, and like us chimps laugh when playing, hug to show affection and are able to walk upright.\n4) In the wild, chimpanzees live in \u2018communities\u2019 made up of around 15 to 80 members led by a dominant, alpha male. Within their communities, chimps sleep, travel and feed in smaller sub-groups of up to ten. These sub-groups can be very flexible, with members changing quickly and regularly.\n5) After humans, chimpanzees are the most intelligent of our planet\u2019s primates (an animal group which includes apes and monkeys, too), and they\u2019ve developed impressive ways of communicating. These clever critters \u201ctalk\u201d to each other using different gestures, facial expressions and numerous vocalisations, too, such as hoots, grunts and screams.\n6) Chimpanzees are experts at grooming, and spend a lot of their time running their fingers through each other\u2019s hair to remove dirt, pesky parasites and dead skin. Yucky, eh? Well, it might sound a bit gross to us, but grooming is an super important activity for these cool critters \u2013 it not only keeps them clean, but helps them build friendships and strengthen bonds with each other, too.\n7) When it comes to food, chimpanzees aren\u2019t exactly fussy! Fruit is at the top of their menu, but they also tuck into leaves, flowers, seeds, bird eggs, insects and even other animals, too, such as monkeys and wild pigs. Some groups of chimps eat up to 200 different kinds of food, in fact.\n8) These awesome apes are one of the few animals that use tools to help them get things done. Chimpanzees have been known to crack open nuts with rocks, fish out insects from nests and logs using sticks, and shelter from the rain by holding up leaves like umbrellas. Impressive stuff!\n9) Females generally give birth to a single chimp (or occasionally twins) every five to six years. For the first six months, the baby chimpanzee clings to the fur on its mother\u2019s belly, and then later rides around on her back until the age of two. After that, the youngster will spend the next seven to ten years by its mother\u2019s side learning how to find food, use tools and build nests to sleep in.\n10) Once found throughout the tropical forests of West and Central Africa, today only around 150,000-200,000 chimpanzees remain in the wild. Sadly, since the early 19th century populations have declined because of habitat loss, hunting and capture for use in zoos, circuses and medical research.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Douc images!\nThe Douc can be called \u201cA Casualty of War.\u201d\nThe douc is an Old World Monkey from Indochina with the face of an ancient, bearded sage. Despite this, it is playful, full of life, and gregarious. The red-shanked species is also the most colorful monkey in the world with a coat that comes in shades of white, red, gray, and black. Despite this, all three species of this primate are in danger of going extinct due to hunting and deforestation. Indeed, the monkey was one of the many casualties of the Vietnam War, as Agent Orange was used to defoliate the trees where it lived. To add insult to injury, soldiers used the animal as target practice. The populations still haven\u2019t recovered from this.\n5 Incredible Douc Facts!\nHere are five facts to know about this uniquely beautiful monkey:\nTheir long tails are not prehensile. A non-prehensile tail is a trait of Old Work monkeys.\nBoth males and females eventually leave their birth family.\nThe monkey has a pug nose but is closely related to the proboscis monkey.\nLike other Old World monkeys, Pygathrix langurs don\u2019t have cheek pouches.\nIt does have a multi-chambered stomach. It needs this to break down the cellulose of all the leaves it eats.\nDouc Scientific name\nThe genus these langurs belong to is Pygathrix. Pygathrix means \u201chairy buttocks\u201d in Ancient Greek. Pug\u1e17 means \u201cbuttocks\u201d and thrix means \u201chair.\u201d It is, after all, one way to describe this Old World monkey. The nemaeus in P. nemaeus evokes the Nemean lion of Hercules as the monkey\u2019s beard and whiskers resemble the mane of a lion. The nigripes in P. nigripes means \u201cblack-footed\u201d in Latin, and the cinerea in P. cinerea is Latin for \u201cash-colored.\u201d There do not appear to be subspecies, though grey-shanked and red-shanked doucs live close enough to interbreed. The name douc is Vietnamese for \u201cmonkey.\u201d\nThe douc is a type of monkey called a langur. Langurs belong to the Colobinae subfamily in the Cercopithecidae family. They are Old world monkeys, which means they are native to Asia and Africa.\nDouc Appearance\nThe animal\u2019s appearance is singular, and it is one of the most colorful of primates. This is especially true of the red-shanked species. What all Pygathrix langurs have in common is a face with almond eyes and a tiny nose framed by a beard that makes the animal look like a sometimes solemn old man. The body is long and slender, between 21 and 24 inches in length, and the tail is about as long as the body. Males are larger than females.\nThe red-shanked douc is so colorful that is known as the five-color douc. It can be told from other Pygathrix langurs because it looks like it\u2019s wearing reddish-brown leggings. It has white forearms and a white tail that\u2019s used for keeping balance and ends in a tassel. The langur has a yellow-orange face and ears framed by a white beard and whiskers that are more voluminous than the whiskers of the other doucs. The dark eyes have blue eyelids. There\u2019s a black band across the forehead. The legs above the red \u201cleggings\u201d are shades of gray, and the feet below them are black. The belly and the back are gray, and there\u2019s a triangular white patch on the rump. Males can be told from females because males have spots just above the triangle. This is true of all three species. The infant has a black face and tan fur and grows into adult colors over time.\nThe black-shanked can be told from other species because it has a slate-colored face with yellow rings around its eyes. This contrasts greatly with its white whiskers. It has black fur from its forehead down to its shoulders where it turns black as it continues down the monkey\u2019s back. Its shanks are black, which gives it its name. The belly is pale gray, and the tail is white. Black-shanked douc langurs are the smallest of the doucs.\nThe grey-shanked has, as its name says, gray shanks, and indeed most of its body is gray. Its feet and its hands are black, and it has a white throat with an orange, black-lined band that meets up with black patches on the animal\u2019s shoulders. The tail of the grey-shanked douc is about 4 inches longer than the tails of the other species.\nRed-shanked douc langur up in a tree. kungverylucky/Shutterstock.com\nDouc Behavior\nDespite its sometimes somber look, the douc is an active, agile, and playful primate. It lives in the trees in groups that can be as small as four but as large as 50, though a group of 50 is very unusual. However, there are instances of ales who travel alone. It is diurnal, which means it\u2019s active during the day. There are usually two females for every male.\nMales dominate, and there\u2019s a dominance hierarchy, but these primates are seen to be unusually genial. They will even share their food, which is unusual for monkeys. They have a great repertoire of facial expressions, including a play face that invites another member of the group to play. Grimacing, on the other hand, means submission. The douc doesn\u2019t have a large vocal range, though they growl to show aggression and have distress and warning calls. The monkeys also spend much time grooming each other. They usually groom in the afternoon, before they take a nap or go to sleep for the night. This is especially true of females.\nDoucs are noisy when they travel from tree to tree. They are led by a dominant male, with females and babies in the middle and subordinate males at the back. However, they\u2019re usually resting, grooming, digesting, playing, and play-fighting. They rarely leave the trees, though they\u2019ve been known to go to the ground to eat soil for its mineral content.\nDouc Habitat\nThese monkeys live in the forests of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The red-shanked can be found in the lowlands and as high as 6000 feet in the mountains. Black-shanked and grey-shanked live in evergreen or mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. They can also live in the mountains and prefer trees that are 82 to 115 feet tall.\nDouc Diet\nThese Old World monkeys are largely folivores, which means they eat leaves, especially leaves that are young and tender. They\u2019ll also eat seeds, fruit, buds, and flowers. Interestingly, they prefer fruit that\u2019s not quite ripe, as ripe fruit upsets their stomachs. Doucs are very particular about what they eat, and if a leaf, flower, or fruit isn\u2019t up to their standards, they\u2019ll toss it. They get all the hydration they need from their food or from sipping the morning dew. The monkeys have a multi-chambered stomach, much like a cow, that helps them break down their food through fermentation. A well-fed douc often has a potbelly.\nAmong the leaves and fruits eaten are:\nFigs\nBurmese grapes\nPhyllanthus leaves\nIndochina dragonplum leaves\nLeaves of the Canarium tree\nBead tree leaves\nNepali hog plums\nDuabanga grandiflora fruit\nRambutans\nToddy palm fruit\nScarlet bananas\nDouc Predators and threats\nDoucs do not seem to have natural predators. Their main predators are humans, who destroy their habitat, hunt them for bush meat and medicines, and kidnap them for the pet trade. Because of this, there are no more than 26,000 of these monkeys left in the wild, and all three species are critically endangered. Though 26,000 sounds like a large number, their numbers are declining. Even though the Vietnam War ended decades ago, the monkeys still haven\u2019t recovered from the devastation of Agent Orange.\nDouc Reproduction and Life Cycle\nBlack-shanked doucs don\u2019t appear to have a breeding season. Grey-shanked and red-shanked doucs breed from August to December. Females initiate mating through facial expressions, including jutting out the jaw, shaking the head, and raising and lowering the eyebrows. If the male is interested, he might suggest moving to another area to mate.\nPregnancy lasts between 165 and 205 days, and the mother enters a period of quiet and usually stays near another female. She is intensely interested in all the babies in the group until about two weeks before she gives birth herself. A single infant is born after about an hour and a half of labor. Twins are rare among doucs. Females give birth every couple of years or so.\nThe mother is the primary caretaker of the baby, though she\u2019ll allow other monkeys to babysit. Infants are weaned when they\u2019re about a year old and become sexually mature when they\u2019re about four or five. Females mature a bit earlier than males. A well-cared-for captive douc can live into its 20s, and though they are challenging to raise in captivity, some zoos have done so. The Philadelphia zoo kept a female Pygathrix nemaeus named Toi, who lived to be 21. She started what the zookeepers believed was an age-related decline and was euthanized in 2018.\nDouc Population\nThese colorful and energetic monkeys are all critically endangered. There are only about 26,000 left in the wild in Indochina.\nView all 58 animals that start with D"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Cheetah images!\nCheetah Classification and Evolution\nThe Cheetah is a large and powerful feline that was once found throughout Africa and Asia and even in parts of Europe. Today however, it is found in only a few remote regions of its once vast natural range, primarily due to growing Human settlements and the hunting of them for their fur. There are widely considered to be five different subspecies of Cheetah that vary only very slightly in colouration and are most easily distinguished by their geographic location. Although they are not considered to be part of the \u2018big cat\u2019 family as they cannot roar, Cheetahs are one of Africa\u2018s most powerful predators and are most renowned for their immense speed when in a chase. Capable of reaching speeds of more than 60mph for short periods of time, the Cheetah is the fastest land mammal in the world. Learn about the world\u2019s fastest animals here.\nCheetah Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Cheetah is an animal that has a long and slender body that is covered in coarse yellowish fur and dotted with small black spots. Its long tail helps with balance and changing direction quickly and unlike the rest of the Cheetah\u2019s body, there are ringed markings along the tail which ends in a black tip. Cheetahs have small heads with high set eyes that aid them when surveying the surrounding grasslands for potential prey. They also have distinctive black \u201ctear marks\u201d that run from the inner eye, along their nose and down to the outside of their mouths, which are thought to help protect them from being blinded by the bright sun. The exceptional speed of the Cheetah is caused by a number of things including having strong and powerful hind legs, and an incredibly flexible and muscular spine which allows the Cheetah to not only sprint quickly but also makes them very agile. They also have non-retractable claws which dig into the ground, giving the Cheetah better grip at high speed.\nCheetah Distribution and Habitat\nThe Cheetah is an animal that once had a vast historical range that stretched across a number of continents, but their distribution today is much more scattered with a small number found in Iran and the majority found in sub-Saharan Africa. Although Cheetahs are still found in a few different parts of eastern and southern Africa, the highest population of wild Cheetahs is now found in Namibia in south-western Africa. Cheetahs are most commonly found stalking prey on the vast, open grasslands but they are also found in a variety of other habitats as well including deserts, dense vegetation and mountainous terrain, providing that there are both adequate supplies of food and water. Cheetahs are one of Africa\u2019s most vulnerable felines with population numbers being mainly affected by growing Human settlements that encroach on their native habitats.\nCheetah Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe Cheetah is unique amongst Africa\u2019s felines primarily because they are most active during the day, which avoids competition for food from other large predators like Lions and Hyenas that hunt during the cooler night. They are also one of the more sociable Cat species with males often roaming in small groups, generally with their siblings, and oddly enough, it is the females that are more solitary animals apart from the 18 months or so that they spend looking after their cubs. Cheetahs are fiercely territorial animals that patrol large home ranges and often overlap those of other Cheetahs, and indeed Lions, with females tending to roam across a much larger range than males. They are typically shy and very stealthy animals so that they are able to hunt for prey in the hot daylight hours without being spotted so easily.\nCheetah Reproduction and Life Cycles\nAfter a gestation period that lasts for around 3 months, the female Cheetah gives birth to between two and five baby cheetah cubs that are born blind and incredibly vulnerable in the African wilderness. The cubs suckle from their mother for the first few months when they begin eating meat, and start to accompany her on hunting trips as they are able to learn how to hunt from watching her. Cheetah cubs learn the majority of their hunting techniques through playing with their siblings, and remain with their mother until they can hunt successfully and leave to find their own territory at between 18 months and 2 years old. Sadly, one of the main reasons for such drastic declines in Cheetah numbers is that up to 75% of Cheetah cubs don\u2019t live to be older than 3 months, as their mother has to leave them every day to find food to feed them, leaving the vulnerable cubs helpless in the face of predators.\nCheetah Diet and Prey\nThe Cheetah has exceptional eyesight and so hunts using sight by first stalking its prey (from between 10 to 30 meters away), and then chasing it when the time is right. Cheetahs often kill their prey in vast open spaces but tend to drag it into a hiding place to prevent it from being scavenged by other animals. The Cheetah has to do this as it cannot eat its prey straight away, due to the fact that they are immensely hot after the chase and need time to cool down before they can feast. Cheetahs are carnivorous animals meaning that they only hunt and kill other animals in order to get the nutrition that they need to survive. They mainly hunt large herbivores including Gazelle and a number of large Antelope species such as Wildebeest, along with Zebras and smaller mammals like Hares. The exact diet of the Cheetah though tends to depend on its location.\nCheetah Predators and Threats\nThe adult Cheetah is a dominant predator in its environment and is therefore not seen as prey (more as competition) by other large predators. The Cheetah cubs however, are incredibly vulnerable particularly when their mother is off hunting, and are preyed upon by a number of animals including Lions and Hyenas, but also large avian species such as Eagles and Vultures. The biggest threat to Cheetahs is people, who have not only taken vast areas of its natural habitat for themselves, but have also turned large regions of land into National Parks. Although these areas seem to be showing increases in both Lion and Hyena populations, Cheetah numbers are much lower as there is more competition for food with the increasing numbers of these other large predators.\nCheetah Interesting Facts and Features\nOne of the most distinctive differences between the different subspecies is that their fur colour changes slightly, depending on their surrounding environment. Those Cheetahs found in the more arid desert regions tend to be lighter and have smaller spots than the King Cheetahs that roam the south African grasslands, and are darker, slightly bigger and have larger spots. Although Cheetahs cannot roar, they do make a variety of different sounds including a high-pitched yelp which can be heard for more than a mile away. The Cheetah is one of the most distinctive of the world\u2019s felines and although it is fairly commonly confused with the Leopard, its name is thought to have come from the Hindu word \u2018chita\u2019 which means the \u2018spotted one\u2019.\nCheetah Relationship with Humans\nDespite their fierce appearance, Cheetahs have actually been domesticated by local people for thousands of years, as they were used to help with hunting for food for the villagers. They have also been kept in captivity for a long time, but as they do not seem to produce particularly healthy individuals, wild Cheetahs were regularly caught to restore the bloodline. Hunted by people as trophies throughout much of their natural range, Cheetahs have completely disappeared from numerous places and along with habitat loss to growing Human settlements and the clearing of land for agriculture, Cheetah numbers are still declining rapidly in many areas today.\nCheetah Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Cheetah has been listed by the IUCN as a species that is Vulnerable from extinction in its natural environment in the near future. Habitat loss along with the increase of natural parks that are home to a large number of competing predators has led to drastic declines in the world\u2019s Cheetah population. There are now estimated to be between 7,000 and 10,000 individuals left in the wild, along with a growing number being found in zoos and animal institutes all over the world.\nView all 153 animals that start with C"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Beaver Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Beaver-facts.html", "text": "beaver Facts\nPortrait of a Beaver\nThe social, industrious beaver is a lovely, fascinating animal that has been exploited and misunderstood for centuries. At weights of up to 70 pounds, they are one of the largest rodents in the world, second only to the South American capybara.\nAnd are second only to human beings in their ability to completely alter their environment.\nBeavers are round, well-furred animals, with small ears, large, orange-colored front teeth, beady eyes, and webbed hind feet.\nTheir most distinctive physical feature, though, is a flat, naked, and leathery tail. The tail is shaped like a flounder, and used as a rudder when swimming, a powerful, stabilizing tripod as the beaver sits up on it's haunches, and a storehouse for body fat, which may be necessary in rough winters. But despite the myth, beavers do not use their tails to carry mud, or pack it down.\nThe beavers incredibly thick, double coat of fur was once extremely popular, particularly in the millinery industry where it was used to make the finest, water-proof top hats for people like Abraham Lincoln. As the Eurasian beaver population was depleted, the demand for beaver pelts spurred on the exploration of Canada, and fed the fur trade between French, English and Native American peoples.\nThe beaver also has strong, nimble, hand-like front paws, that have semi-opposable little fingers (not thumbs), with which they maneuver all sorts of building materials. And they are remarkable engineers, using twigs, mud, rocks, branches and entire logs to build two different types of structures, dams and lodges.\nWhen beavers come into a new location, they first build dams across small streams. The dam traps water behind it and creates a pond. The purpose of the dam is to provide deep enough water for the beaver to build a safe home - called a lodge.\nBeavers build their lodge in the middle of the pond, where the pond water provides safety from predators like bears and wolves. But the water level must also be deep enough not to freeze solid in the winter, because beavers live under the ice in the winter, accessing their lodge from underwater entrances and eating twigs and branches they have stored in their submerged larder.\nThe beaver is a vegetarian who eats not just aquatic plants, but also the twigs, leaves and soft branches of all sorts of trees. They also eat the cambium of the tree, which is the soft, woody layer just beneath the mature bark. Cambium makes up a large part of the beavers diet, and requires that they chew straight through the tough outer bark to get to it.\nBeavers don't actually eat the bark, but they can chew through it with ease, using their impressive, self-sharpening incisors. The beavers four front teeth need to be so strong that the enamel on the face of the teeth is infused with iron. The iron rich enamel is resistant to the acidic qualities of tree bark, and causes the teeth to be a bright orange color. The back surface of the teeth are a softer dentin, so the back of the teeth wear out faster than the front, maintaining a tapered cutting edge like a chisel.\nThere are two species of beaver, the North American beaver, and the Eurasian beaver. They are very similar in appearance with the North American animal being a bit larger, with a rounder head, and a wider tail.\nThey are both highly social animals that live in small, busy, incredibly cooperative family groups.\nBeavers have the longest childhood of any rodent, with youngsters staying with parents for 2 to 3 years as they learn the skills of hydro-engineering. Most active at night, they rely on their excellent senses of smell and hearing, but are extremely near-sighted, and will sometimes simply feel around for things with their little hand-like front paws.\nThe beaver uses it's front paws in such a human manner, that Native Americans referred to them as \"little people\", and beavers are, in some ways, quite like us. They constantly manipulate their environment, often for the betterment, but sometimes to the detriment of those around them, they communicate often, with squeaks, whines and moaning sounds, they are affectionate with family members engaging in play and mutual grooming, and they also mate for life.\nhow do beavers build dams?\nBeavers don't live in dams, they build two different types of structures. They create a wide, cone-shaped lodge with underwater entrances to live in, and they build dams to provide them with areas of deep, calm water within which to build their lodge.\nBeavers may build several dams along waterways in order to flood a large enough area for a safe home. The lodge requires a water depth of at least 4 feet to prevent freezing of the underwater entrance ways.\nDams average about 15 feet in length and 5 to 8 feet deep, but sizes vary considerably. There is a 2,500 foot long dam in Canada, that was discovered in 2007 when it was seen by satellite. It was constructed over 30 years ago, and is maintained by 14 different beaver colonies.\nBeavers start construction of the dam by laying a base of stones or thick tree stumps across the waterway. They can move objects as heavy as themselves, and can fell trees as wide as 24\". Once the dam foundation is in place, they begin to place logs and branches across it. They weave these together as they build, and leave lower relief areas along the crest of the dam for water to flow over. Finally, they pack any crevices with mud, pebbles, and moss, to make the dam even more watertight.\nIf the initial dam does not create a deep enough pond to make a lodge, the beaver may build numerous secondary dams to stop more water flow.\nOnce the pond is deep enough, lodge construction begins. Beavers create an island of mud in the middle of the pond by dredging the bottom, and pushing mud into a pile with their front paws. Then they build a house on top of the mud, using logs and branches. They cover the lodge with mud, except for the very top which serves as a ventilation hole. Beavers usually re-mud right before the first frost, so the mud freezes and hardens the roof.\nIn preparing for winter, the beaver gathers large amounts of fresh branches, and carries them underwater to a larder by the entrance of the lodge. They push the ends of the branches into the mud to keep them in place, and access this food during the winter, when the pond has frozen over.\nEven when the ice is hard, and predators can walk on it to get to the lodge, it is too well constructed for them to reach the beavers inside. They may see the steam of the beavers breath rising from the chimney hole the beavers leave in the top of their lodge, and may hear the beavers inside, but many a frustrated wolf or cougar has dug at a beaver lodge with no success.\nThe beavers will emerge in the spring, when the ice has melted, and their family is usually several members larger than it was when they settled down for the winter.\nOn rare occasions, beavers get trapped inside their lodge, when the water level is too low, or they may be forced to try to get out when they run out of food in their larder, but usually the busy beavers have prepared more than adequately, and survive another cold winter under the ice, in the warmth of their incredible lodge.\nbeaver lifestyle\nEurasian beaver\nAre beavers busy? Well, yeah. Like most rodents, the beaver is a fairly active animal with a relatively high metabolism, but the beaver has allot to show for all the activity.\nThe North American beaver can be found throughout much of the continent, in areas where there are streams and rivers. They require areas wooded with some younger growth deciduous trees such as Aspen, cottonwood and willow, which they use both as a food source and as building material.\nA group of beavers is called a family or lodge, but most often, a colony. The typical colony has 6 to 12 members, which are generally a mature pair and their last 2 or 3 batches of youngsters. Immature beavers are called kits, and they take awhile to mature, hanging around the lodge with mom and dad for 2 to 3 years, learning how to build a proper home.\nBeavers are peaceful animals, and show little, if any, aggression. When wild beavers require human handling, for whatever reason, they rarely attempt to bite, but may whine and squeal in protest. Likewise, the lodge they work so hard to build and maintain, may be used by numerous different animals, including dormice and muskrats. These creatures may even eat from the food stores the beavers procure for themselves. But when new beavers attempt to settle in the pond, the colony will drive them off together.\nThey will also mark the perimeter of their pond with dirt mounds that they scent mark with their own special odor. Beavers have two castor sacs under their tails from which they secrete castoreum, a goo that actually smells rather good to humans, and is occasionally used as a perfume extract and vanilla food flavoring.\nThe beaver colony spends much of their time maintaining and repairing both their lodge, and any dams they have built, and collecting and storing food for the winter. Edible branches are stored in an underwater pantry called a larder, which they will access from the lodge, when the pond has frozen over. The family may even have a less elaborate summertime lodge that they use until it is time to commit to the winter lodge. And entire colonies may relocate to an entirely new region, if or when resources are scarce.\nYoungsters will travel about the pond with their parents getting lessons on tree-felling and roof repair. Parents may use their big flat tails to slap the water as a warning of approaching danger, and the entire colony will dive for cover.\nIn the water, the beaver is supremely adapted. Their large hind feet are completely webbed between the toes, the tail can be used for both propulsion and steering, the nose and ears clamp closed with special valves when they submerge, and they can hold their breath for about 15 minutes underwater.\nOn land, however, the beaver is a bit awkward, short-legged and round, with a slow, rocking gait and poor eyesight. Even 60 pound adults can be quick victims when on land, so they prefer not to travel too far on logging trips. When trees and other resources are too far away, they solve the problem by digging canals sometimes hundreds of feet long. These canals, created by simply shoving mud out of the way, are often dug deep enough for the beaver to float log sections down. -Amazing!\nbeaver!\nbeaver reproduction\nbeaver family\nBeavers pair up for life, and the female generally comes into season once a year, in late winter. Their yearly courtship involves happy wrestling and play, and mating takes place inside the lodge, at the coldest time of year.\nMother beavers have 3 to 5 babies on average, and the youngsters are called kits. Gestation is about 105 days, and in the last week or so, the mother prepares a soft nest in a nursery chamber of the lodge, which is usually higher up than the main living chamber, and further from the entrances.\nThe mother gives birth in early spring, when the ice has melted, and the other family members can bring fresh food for her. Newborn beavers are relatively large and well developed. They weigh about 14 ounces, and are already covered with waterproof fur. The eyes and ears are open, and the sense of smell is strong from the moment they're born. Kits begin to chew on fresh vegetation at only a few days old, and are weaned at 2 or 3 weeks. Baby beavers are able to swim within half an hour of birth, but they don't usually venture out of the lodge until they are 3 or 4 weeks old. They will follow closely behind their mother, not in single file as many baby animals do, but in a little half-moon pattern around her rear. When they get tired, they will actually climb up and ride on her back.\nFather beavers are exceptional parents and will begin to take the kits on excursions once they have been out a few times.\nThe other family members, are usually yearlings or teenagers from the last 2 years litters. They also help with the rearing of the babies, swimming with them and babysitting.\nUnlike many rodents which are moved out of the house and completely independent in a matter of weeks, a juvenile beaver has an engineering degree to study for.\nThey begin to train in what is practically an apprenticeship. Watching at first as their parents demonstrate tree chopping, stone positioning, twig arrangement, and waterproofing, and then diving in to help with these various chores. Yearlings begin to work on their own, particularly with the less demanding job of waterproofing the roof of the lodge, or plugging holes in the dam, dredging up armfuls of mud and moss, and pushing it into crevices with their nimble paws.\nEventually, at 2 or sometimes 3 years old, young beavers leave the family pond, usually one at a time, upstream, downstream, or boldly across the valley.\nThis is undoubtedly the most dangerous time in a beavers life. Without the safety net of family, the security of a familiar landscape, even the comfort of the lodge to sleep in, they may travel for days, and as far as 40 miles to find their own piece of land.\nAlong the way, other beaver colonies will chase them off, or they may be lucky enough to run into another wanderer of the opposite sex.\nWhether alone or in a new relationship, the young beaver will find a new, untouched stream, or perhaps an old dam and lodge, abandoned years before when the large trees ran out, that has regrown, and is perfect for a new colony.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

By the 1900\u2019s the beaver population in Eurasia had fallen from 100 million to 1000, in North America from 60 million to just a few thousand, and in Germany from several hundred thousand to only 200.\nFortunately, beavers are making a comeback, but across Asia, Europe and North America, many of the areas where beavers used to be plentiful are suffering from drought. Drought is a period of low precipitation - a basic lack of rain. Beavers can't make it rain, but they can help to keep groundwater and surface water from disappearing during these times.\nNaturally, a beaver dam forms ponds and creates aquatic ecosystems that can greatly benefit the environment. A successful family of beavers will spread out and create lush meadows that serve as havens and permanent residences for dozens of species in the wild. But what they create below the waters surface is even more critical.\nWhen beavers build dams, they create a storage mechanism for water, but more importantly, a deep storage mechanism. Beavers dig furrows and dredge deep down into the bottoms of the ponds they form in an effort to make their lodge as safe as possible. Surrounding their lodge with deep water serves two purposes.\nFirst, the deeper water is below the frost line and doesn't freeze, allowing them continued access to the pond, even though it may be sealed over with ice in the dead of winter.\nSecond, cougars, wolves and bears may be able to catch prey in very shallow water, in fact, bears hunt in water all the time, but they can't catch anything if the water is too deep to stand up in. So, beavers dig deep moats around the lodge, that trap enormous amounts of water, protecting it from evaporation in dry seasons.\nSeveral thousand years ago, the American west was home to giant beavers the size of grizzly bears, and it's landscape was shaped and formed by their activity. Only 500 years ago, the modern beaver was everywhere, and the world's wild spaces looked very different then they do now. But they were hunted for their fur, and eradicated as pests. The beaver is extinct in the wild in several country that it helped to form, like England and\nSome activists and researchers are hoping to reintroduce beavers to areas that need them most, and projects are afoot throughout North America to do just that. But organizations like the California Department of Fish and Wildlife actually classifies beavers as a \"nuisance\" species, and there are many folks opposed to this idea. So can the beaver save the world? We think maybe yes...but they will certainly need our help to do it, and only time will tell...\na few more beaver facts\nBeavers were declared to be fish by the Church, so practicing Catholics could eat their tails for Lent\nBeavers produce a secretion called \"castoreum\" that has a pleasant taste and is occasionally used as vanilla flavoring\nA beaver can hold it's breath for 15 minutes\nGiant ancient beavers were as big as grizzly bears\nBeavers build dams to create ponds, and lodges to live in\nThe beavers incisors are 2 inches long and bright orange\nThe beaver is the second largest rodent, the capybara is first\nBeavers may someday help us survive drought\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Rodentia\nFamily Castoridae\nGenus Castor\nSpecies canadensis,\nBeaver - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT male female kit, pup family GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD colony U.S.A., Canada woodland tree cambium TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG LENGTH 34 mph no 35-60 pounds 36-40 inches ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH LENGTH BIRTHWEIGHT 1 x year 128 days 6 inches 12-16 ounces RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH CAN SWIM colony 3-5 average eyes open 1/2 hour WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 2 weeks 2 - 3 years 2 - 3 years 15-25 years"}

Some examples of these animals are yak, sheep, goats or deer. However, there is more to it as there are also different types of ruminant animals. In this AnimalWised article we're going to talk about the four main groups of ruminant animals. We'll include a list of examples and include other fun facts about these animals. Keep reading to learn more!\nWhat are ruminant animals?\nRuminant animals are polygastric, meaning their stomach is divided into compartments. Some of the compartments have microorganisms that ferment the cellulose in the vegetables they eat into cud, which is easier to digest. Consequently, ruminant animals are also herbivores. Ruminant animals are characterized by their method of digesting food in two phases. Like all animals, they start their digestion after eating food. However, before the digestive process is complete ruminant animals regurgitate their food to chew it again and add saliva. There are four large groups of ruminants. We will list them and give you some examples so that you can fully understand what ruminants are and know one when you see it.\n1. Bovines and Cattle\nMost ruminants belong to the family of bovids, Bovidae. Within that group we find the subfamily of bovines or Bovinae, which includes cattle. These are probably the best known ruminant animals. As you will see below, some animals names are followed by the \u2020 symbol, which means they are extinct. Below is a list of some bovine animals: Anoa\nAuroch \u2020\nBanteng\nBison\nBongo\nBuffalo\nCow, Bull, Ox\nEland\nFour-horned antelope\nGaur\nGayal\nK\u00e9wel\nKudu\nKouprey\nImbabala\nNildai\nNyala\nSaola\nSitatunga\nTamaraw\nWater buffalo\nWild yak\nWisent\nYak\nZebu Did you know... Camelids are not considered ruminants as they do not have a glandular fore stomach. Learn more in our article about the differences between camels and dromedaries. Did you know... that buffaloes, water buffaloes and bison are easily confused?\n2. Ovines and sheep\nAlso within the family of the bovids we can find the subfamily Caprinae, the goat-antelopes. Within that subfamily we find the genus Ovis, the ovines or sheep. The second largest group of ruminants are the ovines, ruminant animals best-known and appreciated for their milk and wool. There are not as many different types as there are in the cattle group but we can still give you a considerable list of ovine animals: Argali\nBighorn sheep\nDomestic sheep\nMouflon\nSnow sheep\nTrinhorn sheep\nUrial There are many different subspecies of domestic and wild sheep, and most of them are named for their native region and habitat. Did you know... Despite being closely related and belonging to the same subfamily, goats and sheep underwent a phylogenetic separation. That happened in the last stage of the Neogene period, which started 23 million years ago and finished only 2.5 million years ago. In geological time, that's only yesterday!\n3. Caprines and goat-antelopes\nThe third group of ruminant animals we examine is that of goat-antelopes, or caprines. The subfamily Caprinae is a cousin to the Bovinae, as they both belong to the Bovidae family. Within this subfamily you can find the ovids, which we separated so as not to mix up goats and sheep. Some caprine ruminants other than sheep include: Alpine ibex\nArabian tahr\nBharal\nBarbary sheep\nChamois\nChinese goral\nChinese serow\nDwarf blue sheep\nGrey goral\nHimalayan serow\nHimalayan tahr\nJapanese serow\nLong-tailed goral\nMarkhor\nMountain goat\nMuskox\nNilgiri tahr\nNubian ibex\nPyrenean chamois\nReg goral\nRed serow\nSiberian ibex\nSpanish ibex\nSumatran serow\nTakin\nTaiwan serow\nWalia ibex\nWest Caucasian tur\nWild goat (includes the domestic goat as a subspecies) Did you know... Through remastication, ruminants are able to reduce the particle size of their food to ensure that their body can assimilate and digest it.\n4. Deer\nTo complete our full list of ruminant animals, we will now look at a very beautiful and noble group of ruminants: Deer. Deer is the general name for the members of the family Cervidae, which includes different subspecies and genera, altogether including more than 90 species. Some examples of deer include: American wapiti or elk\nBarasingha\nBawean deer\nBrocket\nCalamian deer\nChital\nEld's deer\nEurasian elk\nFallow deer\nHog deer\nHuemul\nMaral deer\nMarsh deer\nMindanao mountain deer\nMindoro deer\nMoose\nMule deer\nMuntjac\nPampas deer\nP\u00e8re David's deer\nPhilippine sambar\nPrince Alfred's deer\nPud\u00fa\nRed deer\nReindeer or caribou\nRoe deer\nRusa deer\nSambar deer\nSika deer\nSwamp deer\nTaruca\nThamin\nThorold's deer\nTufted deer\nWater deer\nWhite-tailed deer Did you know... The now extinct Irish elk was one of the largest deer that ever existed? These animals could reach more than 2 m (6.9 ft) tall, and their antlers were a stunning 3.65 m (12 ft) wide. It is believed that Irish elk became extinct more than 7,000 years ago, but the reasons why it happened haven't been found yet.\nMore examples of ruminant animals\nThere are more than 150 species of ruminants in the world, but confusingly enough they don't necessarily include all those in the suborder Ruminantia. Other ruminants outside those groups include: Addax\nAntelope\nBeira\nBlackbuck\nBluebuck\nBontebok\nChevrotain\nDibatag\nDik-dik\nDuiker\nGazelle\nGerenuk\nGiraffe\nGrysbok\nGoa\nHartebeest\nImpala\nKlipspringer\nKob\nLechwe\nMusk deer\nOkapi\nOribi\nOryx\nPronghorn\nPuku\nReedbuck\nRhebok\nSaiga\nSpringbok\nSteenbok\nSuni\nTopi\nTsessebe\nWaterbuck\nWildebeest\nZeren"}

While related, all three are in different taxonomic families.\n\"True\" seals, also called earless seals, are members of the Phocidae family, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). Sea lions are members of the Otariidae family (eared seals), along with several species of fur seals. Walruses are in the Odobenidae family.\nAs their names imply, one difference between the two types of seals is their ears. Eared seals have external ear flaps, while true seals do not. Another difference is that the rear flippers of true seals point backward, and these seals move on land with an up-and-down undulating motion. Fur seals and sea lions can rotate their hind feet and use them to walk along with some speed. Also, fur seals are so-named because they have thick fur that can trap air and help keep them warm. True seals have thin fur and use blubber for insulation.\nSeal sizes\nThere are 18 species of true seals, according to Seals World. The largest is the southern elephant seal. Males are massive, weighing up to 8,500 lbs. (3,855.5 kilograms). Females are much smaller, but still weigh more than a car at 2,000 lbs. (907.18 kg). Males measure about 20 feet long (6 meters), while females are about half as long.\nThe Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary is home to one fifth of California's harbor seals. These marine mammals rely on safe havens within the Sanctuary to haul-out, rest, and breed. (Image credit: NOAA, Photo Library/Jan Roletto)\nThe smallest is the ringed seal, with an average length of 5 feet (1.5 m) and a weight of 110 to 150 lbs. (50 to 70 kg). Unlike other seals, males and females are about the same size. The ringed seal is the most common seal in the Arctic, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nThere are 16 species of eared seals; seven of them are sea lion species. One of the most recognized species, according to the NOAA, is the California sea lion, which is often featured doing tricks at zoos and aquariums. In the wild, these animals live along the West Coast of North America. They are often seen sunning themselves on beaches, docks and jetties. Males average about 700 lbs. (315 kg) and can reach above 1,000 lbs. (455 kg). Females average 240 lbs. (110 kg). [Gallery: Seals of the World]\nHabitat\nTrue seals typically live in the cold ocean waters of the Arctic or off the coasts of Antarctica. Some seals make caves in the snow to live in. Others never leave the ice pack and poke breathing holes in the ice, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Harp, ringed, hooded, spotted, bearded and ribbon seals live in the Arctic. Crabeater, Weddell, leopard and Ross seals live in the Antarctic.\nFur seals and sea lions live in the Northern Pacific between Asia and North America and off the coasts of South America, Antarctica, southwestern Africa and southern Australia. They can spend about two years in the open ocean before returning to their breeding grounds, according to the NOAA.\nDiet\nSeals generally prey on fish, but they will also eat eel, squid, octopus and lobster. Leopard seals will eat penguins and smaller seals, according to Seals World. The gray seal can eat 10 pounds (4.53 kilograms) of food in one day. They sometimes skip eating for a few days, and often stop eating completely during mating season and will live off energy from their stored-up blubber for weeks.\nThe seal pup and Ursula, the mother. The baby is the first born at the New England Aquarium in Boston, which is trying to breed the vulnerable animals. (Image credit: New England Aquarium)\nBaby seals\nWhen mating season comes, male seals will issue deep, throaty calls to attract the attention of females. A male seal will also call out to let other males know that his females are spoken for. Males are very territorial when it comes to mating. They will fight for the right to mate, hitting and biting each other. The winner gets the chance to mate with up to 50 females in their area.\nMothers carry their young for a gestation period of around 10 months. When they feel the time is right, some seals will dig nests in the sand on which to have their young. Seals and sea lions have just one pup a year. Others, like the harp seal, will have their babies directly on icebergs. Baby seals, called pups, will stay on land until their waterproof fur grows in. This can take around a month.\nFemales will mate and become pregnant again as soon as her pups are weaned. Males are not able to mate until they are around 8 years old, because it takes that long for them to grow big enough and strong enough to win a mating fight.\nClassification/taxonomy\nAll pinnipeds \u2014 phocids (true seals), otariids (eared seals) and odobenids (walruses) \u2014 are in different families in the suborder Caniformia (doglike carnivores) and are related to dogs, coyotes, foxes, wolves, skunks, otters and bears.\nThe taxonomy of seals, according to ITIS, is:\nEared seals (fur seals and sea lions)\nKingdom: Animalia\nPhylum: Chordata\nClass: Mammalia\nOrder: Carnivora\nSuborder: Caniformia\nFamily: Otariidae\nGenera and species:\nArctocephalus (southern fur seals \u2014 eight species)\nCallorhinus ursinus (northern fur seal)\nEumetopias jubatus (northern sea lion or Stellar sea lion)\nNeophoca cinerea (Australian sea lion)\nOtaria flavescens (South American sea lion)\nPhocarctos hookeri (New Zealand sea lion)\nZalophus (California sea lions \u2014 three species)\nTrue seals\nKingdom: Animalia\nPhylum: Chordata\nClass: Mammalia\nOrder: Carnivora\nSuborder: Caniformia\nFamily: Phocidae\nA killer whale identifies a Weddell seal resting on an ice floe off the western Antarctic Peninsula. The whale will notify other killer whales in the area so they can coordinate a wave to wash the seal off the floe.

Most seals are not considered endangered, according to the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are a few exceptions, though. The Gal\u00e1pagos fur seal and the monk seal are both endangered. Some local populations, such as gray seals in the Baltic Sea, are endangered. The northern fur seal and hooded seal are vulnerable. The Caribbean monk seal was declared extinct in 2008.\nOther facts\nThe crabeater seal has the largest population of any species of seal in the world. It is estimated there are 2 million to 75 million individual seals, according to the IUCN.\nElephant seals have what is called \"smoker's blood\" because they have the same amount of carbon monoxide in their blood as a person who smokes 40 or more cigarettes each day, according to researchers. Scientists think this high level of gas in their blood may protect them when they dive to deep levels in the ocean.\nHarp seals can stay underwater for up to 15 minutes. Weddell seals are even more impressive. The can stay underwater for up to 80 minutes. They only pop up for air when they find holes in the ice layers above the ocean.\nNina Sen contributed to this article.\nOther resources"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Aardvark images!\nAardvark Classification and Evolution\nAardvarks are small pig-like mammals that are found inhabiting a wide range of different habitats throughout Africa, south of the Sahara. They are mostly solitary and spend their days sleeping in underground burrows to protect them from the heat of the African sun, emerging in the cooler evening to search for food. Their name originates from the Afrikaans language in South Africa and means Earth Pig, due to their long snout and pig-like body. Aardvarks are unique among animals as they are the only surviving species in their animal family. Until recently it was widely believed that they were most closely related to other insectivores such as armadillos and pangolins but this is not the case with their closest living relatives actually thought to be elephants.\nAardvark Anatomy and Appearance\nAardvarks have a unique appearance amongst mammals (and indeed all animals) as they display physical characteristics of a number of different animal species. They have medium-sized, almost hairless bodies and long snouts that make them look distinctly pig-like at first, with thick skin that both protects them from the hot sun and also from being harmed by insect bites. They are able to close their nostrils to stop dust and insects from entering their nose. They have tubular, rabbit-like ears that can stand on end but can also be folded flat to prevent dirt from entering them when they are underground. Aardvarks have strong, claws on each of their spade-like feet that along with the fact that their hind legs are longer than their front legs, makes them strong and capable diggers able to excavate vast amounts of earth at an alarming rate. Due to the fact that they spend most of their lives underground or out hunting in the dark at night, they have poor eyesight but are able to easily navigate their surrounding using their excellent sense of smell to both find prey and to sense potential danger.\nAardvark Distribution and Habitat\nAardvarks are found in a wide variety of different habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa from dry deserts to the moist rainforest regions. The only stipulation (other than having good access to plenty of food and water) is to have good soil in which they can dig their extensive burrows. Despite being highly skilled at digging in sandy or clay soil types, rockier regions prove more of a challenge to create their underground homes so the aardvark will move to another area where soil conditions are better suited to digging. Their burrows can be up to 10 meters (33 ft) long in a home range that can be anywhere from 2 to 5 kilometres square. Their burrows often having multiple entrances and are always left head first so they are able to identify potential predators easily using their keen sense of smell.\nAardvark Behaviour and Lifestyle\nAardvarks are mainly solitary animals that come together only to mate and are never found in large groups. They live in underground burrows to protect them both from the hot daytime sun and from predators. Aardvarks are nocturnal mammals, only leaving the safety of the burrow under the cover of night when they go in search of food and water, often travelling several miles in order to find the biggest termite mounds guided by their excellent hearing and sense of smell. Despite often having a large burrow comprised of an extensive network of tunnels, aardvarks are also known to be able to quickly excavate small temporary burrows where they can protect themselves quickly rather than having to return to their original dwelling.\nAardvark Reproduction and Life Cycles\nAardvarks have specific mating seasons that occur every year. Depending on the region in which the aardvark lives young can be born either in October to November, or May to June in other areas. Known to have babies most years, female aardvarks give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period that usually lasts for around 7 months. Newborn aardvarks often weigh as little as 2kg and are born with hairless, pink skin in the safety of their mother\u2019s burrow. Baby aardvarks spend the first two weeks of their lives in the safety of the underground burrow before beginning to venture out with their mother under the cover of night. However, despite accompanying their mother in search of food they aren\u2019t weaned until they are around three months old. Young aardvarks live with their mother in her burrow until they are around six months old when they move out to dig a burrow of their own. Although their lifespan in the wild is not entirely clear, aardvarks tend to live for more than 20 years in captivity.\nAardvark Diet and Prey\nThe diet of aardvarks is mainly comprised of ants and termites, with termites being their preferred food source. Despite this though, they are known to also eat other insects such as beetles and insect larvae. Aardvarks are built to be insectivores, with strong limbs and claws that are capable of breaking into the harder outer shell of termite mounds very efficiently. Once they have broken into the mound they then use their long, sticky tongue to harvest the insects inside and eat them whole without chewing as they are then ground down in their muscular stomachs. One of the aardvarks most distinctive features is the fact that they have columnar cheek-teeth that serve no functional purpose at all. With some larger ant species that need to be chewed they use the incisors that are located towards the back of their mouths. Aardvarks are also able to use the same techniques to break into underground ant nests.\nAardvark Predators and Threats\nDespite the fact that aardvarks are nocturnal animals that live in the safety of underground burrows, they are threatened by a number of different predators throughout their natural environment. Lions, leopards, hyenas and large snakes (most notably pythons) are the main predators of aardvarks but this does vary depending on where the aardvark lives. Their main form of defence is to escape very quickly underground however, they are also known to be quite aggressive when threatened by these larger animals. Aardvarks use their strong, sharp claws to try and injure their attacker along with kicking the threatening animal with their powerful back legs. Aardvarks are also threatened by humans who hunt them and destroy their natural habitats.\nAardvark Interesting Facts and Features\nAardvarks use their long, sticky tongue to lap up to 50,000 insects a night from inside termite mounds or underground ant nests. Their worm-like tongues can actually grow up to 30 cm in length meaning they can reach more termites further into the mound. Their love of insects has actually led aardvarks also being known as Antbears! Interestingly enough, aardvarks are also thought to get almost all of the moisture they need from their prey meaning that they actually have to physically drink very little water. Aardvarks are thought to be one of the world\u2019s most prolific diggers with their strong limbs and claws and shovel-like feet helping them to be able to shift 2ft of soil in just 15 seconds!\nAardvark Relationship with Humans\nDue to the fact that they spend the daytime hours hidden in the safety of their underground burrows, only emerging under the cover of night to hunt for food, aardvarks are very seldom seen by many people. In some regions though, they are hunted by people for food and are becoming increasingly affected by expanding human populations as more of their natural habitats disappear to make way for growing settlements.\nAardvark Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, aardvarks are listed by the IUCN as a species that is of Least Concern. Despite the fact that population numbers of aardvarks most certainly declined in some countries, in others, their numbers remain stable and they are often commonly found in both protected areas and regions with suitable habitats. They are however becoming increasingly affected by habitat loss in both the form of deforestation and expanding towns and villages. Due to their incredibly elusive nature, exact population sizes are not fully understood.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}

Each group consists of a single dominant male and, sometimes, 1 - 2 additional adult males. The dominant male of the group controls breeding. Members of these family units not only travel collectively, but also sleep huddling together. As arboreal and diurnal creatures, they sleep at night in trees (typically, high in the canopy of rainforest). These macaques are territorial and very communicative animals. One of the distinguishing features of this species is that males define boundaries of their home ranges by calls. Dominant males of different groups emit loud, human-like \u2018whoops\u2019, after which one of the troops leaves the territory. Overall, their communication system contains as many as 17 vocalizations. Along with calls, the Lion-tailed macaques also use body language. For example, they greet each other by smacking their lips, whereas yawning with a grimace is a display of dominance or threat."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Alpaca images!\nThe alpaca is a camelid mammal native to South America.\nClosely related to its larger cousin, the llama, the two species are able to interbreed. Yarn spun from alpaca wool is popular for warm, soft sweaters, socks, mittens, and hats, making the fur of these domesticated animals a valuable commodity.\nFive Incredible Alpaca Facts!\nThe ancient Incas first domesticated the alpaca more than 6,000 years ago. They made robes of alpaca fur for the nobles and royalty.\nAlpacas\u2019 stomachs have three chambers.\nThe single alpaca species has two breeds: the dreadlocked suri and the fluffy huacaya.\nMost of the noise alpacas make is humming. Depending on the situation, this expresses contentment, curiosity, boredom, caution or distress.\nWhen llamas cross breed with alpacas, the baby is called a huarizo.\nAlpaca Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for alpaca, Vicu\u00f1a pacos, reflects its descendancy from the vicugna, an ancient, wild camelid mammal. Prior to 2001, these animals was called Lama pacos. However, a DNA study revealed it descended from the vicugna rather than the guanaco, the llama\u2019s forbear. This fact generated the name change.\nAlpaca Appearance\nThe alpaca is a smaller animal than the llama, although the two resemble one another in several ways. These animals stand 32-39 inches from foot to withers, and they measure an average of 5.5 feet in length. They have small heads, large eyes, flame-shaped ears that stand up, and long necks.\nThe two breeds have different types of fur. The huacaya breed, which comprises about 90 percent of the world\u2019s alpacas, has thick, fluffy fleece adapted for life at cool, high altitudes. The suri breed has silkier fur that grows into long dreadlock-type curls. Experts believe their silkier, less dense wool is the product of life at a lower, more temperate mountain environment. Right after shearing, alpacas look more like humpless camels than llamas.\nAlpaca Vs. Llama\nSome similarities and differences in appearance between alpacas and llamas include:\nEars: Alpacas\u2019 ears are short and flame-shaped while llamas\u2019 are longer and banana-shaped.\nHead: The alpaca\u2019s head is shorter and blunter than a llama\u2019s head.\nWeight: Alpacas average around 150 pounds while llamas are more than twice that weight.\nHeight: Llamas are about 10 inches taller at the withers than alpacas.\nDNA: Llamas are descended from the guanaco while alpacas are descended from the vicugna, both wild camelid mammals.\nUse: Alpacas are animals that are prized for their soft, warm, and fire-resistant wool while llamas are mainly employed as pack animals and guards for domestic herds such as sheep.\nDisposition: Alpacas are timider than llamas.\nAlpaca Behavior\nOverall, this small camelid mammal is intelligent, gentle, and friendly. It lives in herds and is very sociable with other alpacas. Within each herd, family groups each consist of several females and their young plus an alpha male. Like other ruminants such as horses, they can be flighty and nervous when they sense a threat is nearby. Males can get aggressive and sometimes fight other alpaca males.\nThese animals communicate through body language and the sounds they make. Sometimes a male will stand broadside before his family with his ears all the way back. This is a protective pose. To a baby, a larger object or animal means protection, and the baby will follow or sit near it.\nThese animals hum when they are happy, bored, curious, worried, or distressed. A mother and baby may hum together when bonding. A mother may cluck, henlike, when worried about her cria. A male might cluck in welcome to others.\nWhen it feels threatened, like when a strange alpaca is crowding its space, this animal snorts. It may also make a gurgling sound to warn others.\nThis animal can make loud sounds of distress too. When mishandled or physically threatened, it can voice an ear-splitting scream. Males screech to intimidate other males when fighting for dominance. Females screech when upset, but it sounds more like a growl.\nAlpaca Habitat\nSince the era of the Incas, these animals lived in domesticated herds in the Andes Mountain highlands. They live there still, sharing habitat with other South American mountain natives like spectacled bears, mountain lions, condors, flamingos and llamas.\nThese animals also adapt well to other environments. They live throughout the world on alpaca farms where farm workers harvest their wool for yarn and garment manufacturing.\nAlpaca Diet\nThese animals are grazing animals. They eat fresh grass in the field, hay, and occasionally, bark or tree leaves. Farmers sometimes supplement the hay with nutritional additives designed for special situations, such as pregnancy and lactation.\nThey are \u201ceasy keepers\u201d because they don\u2019t eat a lot. A 125-lb. animal only needs about two pounds of hay, or 1.5 percent of its weight, per day. Grass is difficult to digest because of its fibrous nature. Alpacas have stomachs with three chambers to do the job efficiently. This camelid mammal\u2019s stomach also secretes acids that aid in digesting rougher forage so they can get the nutrients they need.\nAlpaca Predators and Threats\nLarger carnivores who live in the same South American highlands prey on these animals. These include bears, maned wolves and coyotes. Although they have few defenses against such predators, they do have long necks that allow them to see danger approaching.\nIn other locations, these animals are under threat from native wildlife, which may be gray wolves, packs of domestic dogs and foxes. They can vocalize and spit to frighten off predators.\nAlpaca Reproduction and Life Cycle\nFemales do not have a specific breeding season. Instead, whenever they breed, it induces the reproduction process. Typically, they breed once per year because it takes up to 345 days for a baby to develop in the womb.\nThese animals have a single baby at a time. The average newborn weighs 8 to 9 kg (19 lbs). At around 7 months old, the mother weans the cria. Female juveniles will be ready to mate at 12 to 15 months. Males reach sexual maturity quite a bit later, at around three years of age.\nHealthy animals can live as long as 20 years. One extraordinary alpaca lived to be 27.\nAlpaca Population\nThe largest population of these animals worldwide lives in the Andes Mountains of Peru. It accounts for more than 50 percent of all of them.\nAt one point in the 16th century, the species almost disappeared. Disease brought to South America by the Spanish invaders nearly decimated the population, killing 98 percent. Also, due to the conquest, the remaining animals had to move to higher ground, where they still live today.\nDuring the 19th century, European settlers rediscovered the species and found the animal to be of value. They prized the animals for their wool and nurtured them. Thereafter, the remaining population began to recover and eventually once again become robust. Today, alpacas are not listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Mongoose Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Mongoose-facts.html", "text": "mongoose Facts\nAlthough they appear remarkably similar to weasels in form and lifestyle, mongooses are actually members of the superfamily feliforma, or \"cat-like\" carnivores, while weasels are in the superfamily caniforma or \"dog-like\" carnivores.\nAnd yes - the plural of mongoose is mongooses - not mongeese!\nFeliforms and caniforms have significant differences in skull structure among other things, and are classified based on these complex, skeletal criteria. So the mongoose, which shares ancient ancestors with cats, is actually most closely related to the civet, and is in the same superfamily as the hyena and the leopard.\nSimply put, the mongoose is not a weasel. The meerkat, however, is a mongoose, but since it is such a popular little animal and is in its own genus, you can read about it here - Meerkat Facts.\nMost mongoose species are highly social animals living in busy groups of 6 to 40 individuals called \"packs\" or \"mobs\". Some particularly gregarious species like the Gambian mongoose may live in packs of 50 or more. These groups may be lead by an alpha male and female who are often the only two individuals who mate and reproduce.\nSome mongoose species live in a cooperative society where each member of the pack has a specific job and subsequent duties. Some are hunters, some stay behind and \"baby sit\". In this system, older or infirmed members and youngsters are often nurtured by the entire pack, with kills being brought back to the home front and generally freely shared.\nThe mongoose is a small animal but an excellent hunter, with keen senses of smell, sight and hearing, and remarkable reflexes. They hunt insects and small animals such as mice, rats, rabbits, lizards and snakes, including one of the most dangerous creatures on Earth - the dreaded King cobra. They are largely immune to the venom of scorpions and snakes, although repeated stings or strikes may sicken and even kill them.\nMongooses are remarkably bright animals that have complex social structures and have even displayed simple tool use. Several species of mongoose routinely crack open eggs, nuts, or shelled creatures such as crabs or mollusks by dropping or throwing them on rocks. Some will raise up on their hind legs with the item in their forepaws and drop it on a stone. Others have been observed hunched over like a football center, launching objects between their legs against a large stone or tree. This behavior is observed and practiced by youngsters until perfected. - Mongoose Facts\nhow does a mongoose kill a cobra?\nThe mongoose is notorious for one fascinating fact - their astounding ability to battle and kill some of the deadliest creatures on Earth. Native to India, the King cobra is the largest venomous snake in the world, capable of reaching a length of 20 feet and a weight of over 35 pounds. A bite from a King cobra can kill an adult human being in less than 30 minutes.\nIn the wild, there are only 2 things a King cobra must fear, people and mongooses. The mongoose is a constantly active hunter and forager that eats a wide variety of small prey animals and loves snakes in particular. All species of mongoose eat snakes regularly, but the slender mongoose and the grey mongoose are the two species most likely to confront and devour a King cobra.\nFirst, their habitats overlap, second, these mongooses are some of the largest species, and third, practice makes perfect. A confrontation between a mongoose and a cobra is not an everyday event, but it is not uncommon either. In general, the mongoose is the cobras only natural predator other than human beings.\nKing cobras actually eat other snakes as their main diet, as well as small animals like rats and birds. Many of the things they eat are larger than a typical mongoose, but the King cobra wants no part of the mongoose. The snake will try to avoid confrontation if it runs into a mongoose, but will stand its ground once cornered and defend itself if it can't get away.\nThe mongoose is incredibly, blurringly swift and is capable of dodging the strikes of the also very swift cobra, but the mongoose also possesses something called acetylcholine receptors which make it , not fully immune, but relatively tolerant of cobra venom. When it makes its move, the mongoose leaps, teeth bared, directly for the head of the snake. If the mongoose grabs the snake correctly it will kill it by biting right into its skull.\nThe cobra may wrap around the mongoose but will usually succumb to the mongooses attack in a matter of moments If the mongooses first leap is inaccurate, it may be bitten.\nIf the cobra bites the mongoose more than once, the mongoose may loose the battle and become the cobras dinner. It is thought that mongooses win about 75 to 80% of these encounters, and they will eat the cobra, venom sacs and all.\nA king cobras venom is not poison, it is a modified saliva that must be injected into the victim in order to be lethal, so the mongoose is free to consume the entire body of its neutralized victim. - Mongoose Facts\nsome of the many mongoose species\nmongoose reproduction\nMongoose mother and baby\nThe numerous species of mongooses have many different lifestyles and reproductive strategies.\nSome live in groups where only the alpha male and female will reproduce. In these packs the rest of the gang will help with the raising of just a few youngsters from this select breeding.\nOther species live in larger colonies where the females have synchronized estrus cycles. All the females will mate with the most dominant males and they will all give birth within hours of each other.\nThe babies will be raised by the entire colony, and when the members of these packs leave the den to forage, several \"babysitters\" will stay behind and mind the huge, communal litter of pups.\nA few mongoose species are solitary animals with males and females only coming together to mate once a year. With these species the male may stay to help raise the litter of 2 to 6 babies called pups, or the female may raise her pups alone.\nIn some mongoose societies, young pups beg all the adults in the pack for food but eventually choose one adult, called an \"escort\" who will provide that individual pup with food until the youngster can fend for itself at about 5 months old.\nA baby mongoose spends most of its time playing and wrestling with litter mates while the adults in the pack forage. When an adult uncovers a beetle, digs up a millipede or snatches an egg, the pups forget about play and beg for a meal using high-pitched chirps like baby birds. Youngsters of most species remain with their family group for life. - Mongoose Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They are sometimes referred to as red meerkats although both animals are in their own genus. The yellow mongoose lives in busy colonies and digs large and fairly elaborate dens with multiple rooms and tunnels. They often peacefully share their dens with ground squirrels. The colony will usually start the day by slowly emerging from their burrow and lounging about the entrance sunbathing and grooming each other. Then they will set off to forage for their favorite foods - big bugs.\nBasically an insectivore, the yellow mongoose relishes scorpions, millipedes, beetles and roaches. Birds eggs, the occasional mouse or lizard and some unfortunate snakes round out the menu, but bugs are by far the bulk of their diet.\nYellow mongoose packs usually consist of an alpha male and female and assorted relatives. Youngsters are commonly cared for by the entire family, and older or less able individuals are often nurtured by the group as a whole, supplied with food, and protected by all the members of the pack. - Mongoose Facts\nbanded mongoose facts\nThe banded mongoose is a medium sized species of mongoose weighing about 5 pounds. They live in big social groups with several dominant males who not only routinely mark their territory but also the other members in the group with their scent glands.\nThe banded mongoose has several very unique habits and has become famous for its interaction with other species of animals. Bandeds have been observed foraging with troops of chacma baboons and co-existing rather peacefully. Some baboons have been observed stroking and even holding mongooses as if they were pets. Mostly, the two species must find some safety in numbers as they forage.\nIn another interesting example of inter-species activity, banded mongooses have been regularly observed grooming warthogs. Individuals have been seen climbing on the backs of these potentially very dangerous animals and carefully removing ticks and other irritants.\nThis species of mongoose in particular, has shown amazing adaptive abilities, and their cooperation with other species is matched only by teamwork within their own pack.\nIf startled or threatened a pack of banded mongooses has a unique and unsettling defense mechanism. Sometimes referred to as \"mobbing\" the entire group will mass together in a tightly packed formation and charge their opponent as one. While charging they will scream, churl and holler, but most unnervingly they will rise up, sink down and writhe side to side creating the illusion of one single huge and convulsing animal.\nFew foes will stand their ground against a well executed banded mongoose mobbing, and many a hyena, leopard or lion has been sent fleeing from the sight! - Mongoose Facts\ndwarf mongoose facts\nThe smallest of the mongoose species, the tiny dwarf mongoose is only 7 to 10 inches long and lives in social groups of up to 20 individuals. The dwarf mongoose pack moves about its large territory using numerous termite mounds, caves and tree hollows as shelters for a few days at a time. Termite mounds are a favorite, and they will renovate the structures to suit their needs, adding rooms and widening tunnels.\nThey mark their territory with anal gland secretions, rubs of their cheek glands, and the strategic placement of communal latrines, where all members defecate in a concentrated pile. The dwarf mongoose pack is usually led by a dominant female who chooses new den sites and directions of travel. Generally she is the only female to mate and will often produce three litters a year. The pups, usually 2 to 5 per litter, will be raised by the entire pack. Subordinate females within the group lactate and actually nurse the dominant females pups.\nLike the banded mongoose, the dwarf mongoose has been seen collaborating with other species. They are often seen together with birds of the hornbill species, each creature benefiting from the others heightened senses and alerting each other of predators as they forage. - Mongoose Facts\na few more mongoose facts\nA group of mongooses is called a \"mob\" a \"pack\" a \"gang\" or a \"troop\"\nThe mongoose is not a weasel\nThe meerkat is a species of mongoose\nSome mongoose species live in abandoned termite mounds\nThe mongoose was made famous in the jungle book story \"Rikki tikki tavi\" by Rudyard Kipling, a short story about an Indian grey mongoose.\nSeveral species of mongoose show an example of simple tool use by throwing or dropping eggs, shellfish and nuts against rocks to open them.\nThe mongoose has horizontal pupils.\nMost mongoose species have very high tolerance to scorpion and snake venom -Mongoose Facts!\nthe mongoose is a\ncarnivorous (meat-eating)\ndiurnal (active during the day)\nterrestrial (lives on ground) digitigrade(walks on toes)\nfeliform (cat-like carnivore)\nmammal (animal with mammary glands and hair follicles) Scientific Classification\nClass - Mammalia\nOrder - Feliforma\nFamily - Herpestidae\nGenus - 18\nSpecies - 37 MONGOOSE - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT male female pup, puppy usually colony GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD gang, pack Europe, Asia, Africa grasslands,desert insects, mice ENEMIES AVG.

It is the highest grossing stage production of all time and is still on Broadway to this day. Elton John, along with Tim Rice, contributed three new compositions for the Broadway adaptation of he smash hit movie. The Lion King debuted at the New Amsterdam Theatre, and later switched to the Minskoff Theatre where it currently resides. Interestingly, the production that took its slot at the New Amsterdam Theatre is Disney\u2019s other hit Aladdin. SMH, Disney sure knows how to crank out the hits. You can see GIFs and MEMEs as well of their work on Tiktok and Twitter. Production for a remake of the film began in May of 2017. Elton John signed on again to work some compositions. Nathan Lane auditioned for Zazu but ended up as Timon.\nStay current with other incredible and amazing facts about Hadestown, Dear Evan Hansen, To Kill A Mockingbird, Pablo Picasso, Pink, Post Malone, Lizzo, Tyler The Creator, Billie Eilish, and many more artists and performers.\nWhat is it about the Lion King that resonates in our minds so strongly? Why does it continue to remain in our hearts and minds? There are many reasons, some of which you might not even realize. Here are a few reasons. TBH \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most magical stories ever told.\nWhen young George Washington sat on the steps of the home\u2019s family\u2019s log cabin, he was forced to watch as his younger brother looked at a small boy in a rainbow-colored dress that belonged to a Native American woman. He watched as he peered out from the window of his home, out into the world. The Lion King showed what young Nathan Lane could do with his heart, mind, and creativity when placed in an environment that allowed him to fully develop those attributes. Using animals takes a lot of talent much like if working with a tiger or dog or cat. You might say the pairs are OTP on Facebook but it\u2019s true.\nWhen Nathan Lane takes on the role of Simba in the Broadway musical version of the Lion King, he becomes a part of the story that is being told to all young boys everywhere. Whether or not it is the best version of the story, you can bet that the Lion King does influence young boys from around the world. If you have a son, the Lion King is an example that they will be inspired by. You can also bet that the Lion King will certainly influence their life as well. Even if your son didn\u2019t live through the time period, the story does hold a place in their heart and soul. The musical captures your heart much like Hadestown and Dear Evan Hansen or a song from Billie Eilish or a painting from Andy Warhol. The writing resonates and lasts over time, much like that from JD Salinger, Mark Twain, and Edgar Allan Poe.\nWhen you look at the words of Bob Thomas, who wrote the lyrics for the Broadway musical, you can hear the inspiration he gained from watching his father go through the days of his childhood. His father was no different than any other father, although his father was different than his father. He held a torch for his son and didn\u2019t hesitate to let his son know about it. Dad didn\u2019t know a whole lot about the movie, but he sure knew a whole lot about the theater. He had been a movie buff since he was a kid, and he knew a lot about movies.\nOne of the biggest influences that this Broadway musical has had on the entire world is through its theme song. For many years, the Lion King and Broadway musical have been linked, and the title song became an instant hit for the musical. The song is titled \u201cYou Belong To Me,\u201d and it tells the story of how Nathan Lane\u2019s heart connects to that of the King and his people.\nWhat does Elton John, the singing voice of the king, sing to the audience in the middle of the show? It\u2019s a smash. It\u2019s a legendary song that has been played over again, and it\u2019s one of the best songs that shows how influential this movie has been to the world.\nDon\u2019t miss the Lion King on Broadway. It\u2019s a fun and memorable time, and you won\u2019t regret the ride.

No doubt, the words are so beautiful and they add so much drama to the story line of this movie. The lyrics of the songs on The Lion King have never failed to win over the hearts of children and adults alike. So many young children were inspired by these songs to become singers after they heard the lyrics. Influential stars like Elton John and Beyonce are directly involved with the music.\nIn my opinion, Elton John is definitely one of the greatest musicians of all time. He is able to make us feel like we are part of the world he creates. His vocals and lyrics help us to identify with his characters and this will make you feel like you are watching a movie. I can honestly say that this is a movie that everyone should watch. It shows true friendship between the animals of the forest, which makes the whole concept of the movie even more poignant.\nElton John deserves to be listed alongside the greats such as Prince, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, and Michael Jackson. His impact on music cannot be measured. But when you see how many people listen to his music then you realize how important his contributions are. His voice just does not stop, it is amazing and it has created a wave of passion and emotion in music for children and adults alike. So when you hear his song, \u201cCircle of Life\u201d in The Lion King, you will understand why."}

Today, three rhino species are listed as \u201cCritically Endangered\u201d and clinging to small pockets of habitat.\nWith its distinctive horn and massive size, the rhino is one of the most unique animals on Earth. However, heavy poaching for its horn threatens several rhino species today.\nTypes of Rhino \u2013 The 5 Rhino Species\nThere are five separate species of rhino that vary dramatically in size and anatomy. Today, the rhino is an animal that lives across Africa and Asia.\nThe largest species of rhino, the white rhinoceros, is an animal that is native to Africa. While the Southern white rhino has rebounded from the brink of extinction today, the Northern white rhino is now functionally extinct after the last male died in 2018.\nKnown for its triangular upper lip, the black rhinoceros is an animal that once roamed across nearly all of sub-Saharan Africa. However, today it\u2019s critically endangered.\nThe largest rhinoceros native to Asia, the Indian rhinoceros has a range that extends across the foothills of the Indian subcontinent. The Indian rhinoceros has a distinct appearance with a single horn and skin that has the appearance of \u201cbody armor.\u201d\nOnce found from India to the island of Borneo, today the Sumatran rhinoceros is critically endangered and located in just a few isolated pockets deep inside jungles.\nWhile the Sumatran rhinoceros can still weigh up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds), it\u2019s the smallest species of rhinoceros in the world. Sumatran rhinos are known for their prehistoric appearance, with hair that can cover their entire bodies.\nOnce roaming across Southeast Asia, The Javan rhinoceros today is limited to a single nature preserve in Indonesia named Ujung Kulan National Park.\nRhinoceros Scientific Name\nThe name rhinoceros is derived from the Greek words that mean \u201cNose-horn.\u201d The rhinocerotidae family has five species with the following scientific names:\n\u00b7 Black Rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis)\n\u00b7 White Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum)\n\u00b7 Indian Rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis\n\u00b7 Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis)\n\u00b7 Javan Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus)\nRhino: The Animal\u2019s Appearance\nRhinos are the second largest land animal, behind only the elephant. The species first evolved during the Eocene \u2013 an era that ended about 33.9 million years ago \u2013 and are one of the last surviving \u201cmegafauna.\u201d That is, animals which are simply massive by today\u2019s standards.\nThey have a robust, cylindrical body with a large head, relatively short legs, and short tail. The characteristic feature of these animals is a large horn in the middle of their faces; some species have a second, smaller horn.\nRhinos have brilliant hearing and the rhino also has a keen sense of smell, but the rhino is well known for having extremely poor eyesight. They are usually grey, black, or brown (though one species is called the \u201cwhite rhino\u201d).\nRhino: The Animal\u2019s Weight\nRhino species vary widely in length and weight, but average about 1.5 tons (1,360 kg) in weight as adults. The largest species, the white rhino can weigh up to 3,600 kg (7,920 pounds), which makes it nearly four times the weight of the smaller Sumatran rhinoceros on average!\n\u00b7 White rhino: 1,440 \u2013 3,600 kg (3,168-7,920 lbs)\n\u00b7 Black rhino: 800-1,400 kg (1,800-3,100 lbs)\n\u00b7 Indian rhino: 2,200 \u2013 3,000 kg (4,900-6,600 lbs)\n\u00b7 Javan rhino: 900 \u2013 2,300 kg (2,000-5,100 lbs)\n\u00b7 Sumatran rhino: 500 \u2013 800 kg (1,100-1760 lbs)\nRhino horn\nThe most notable features of rhinos are the large horns that grow from their heads.\nThe horns of a rhinoceros are made of keratin, the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails in most animals including humans. Both African species of rhino and the Sumatran rhinoceros have two horns, while the Indian rhino and Javan rhinoceros have just one horn.\nFemale Javan rhinos are notable in that they often lack a horn or have a smaller \u201cbump\u201d on their nose.\nUnfortunately, rhinos face incredible pressure from poaching as their horn is desired for both traditional Chinese medicine and as a status symbol.\nLongest rhino horns\nIn 2006, Dr. Nico van Strien conducted a study on the longest rhino horns by species.\nWhite rhino: 59 inches (150 cm)\nBlack rhino: 51 inches (130 cm)\nSumatran rhino: 32 inches (81 cm)\nIndian rhino: 23 inches (57 cm)\nJavan rhino: 11 inches (27 cm)\nRhino horns can grow in a variety of shapes. For example, a white rhino held in captivity in Sequim, Washington had a horn that grew to more than four feet in size that grew parallel to the ground. The horn grew so large it had to be trimmed twice using a chainsaw!\nRhino: The Animal\u2019s behavior\nRhinos generally live a solitary lifestyle. Black rhinos will more aggressively defend their territory while Indian and Javan rhinos have more loosely defined territory that may overlap. Sumatran rhinos, which live in more dense forests and vegetation are diligent about marking trails with feces and urine.\nGroups of rhinos\nWhile most rhino species are solitary, the white rhino is the most social of all species. Groups of a dozen or more white rhinos will often form. This behavior is particularly common among females with calves, as it can help mothers protect their offspring at a time they face greater threats from predators.\nA group of rhinos is called a \u201ccrash.\u201d\nRhino Habitat\nThe rhinoceros is generally found in thick forests and savannas where there is plenty of food to eat and lots of cover for the rhino to hide in. Rhinoceros\u2019 once spanned a range that spanned across the majority of Africa and Southeast Asia, however today their range has been significantly reduced.\nIn Africa, the rhinoceros\u2019 historical range was on grasslands and savannah stretching across most of sub-Saharan Africa. Today, while black rhinos can still be found stretching from Ethiopia to South Africa, their populations are limited to smaller pockets on nature preserves and other protected areas.\nThe Sumatran and Javan rhino live in denser forests and once saw their range extend across all of Southeast Asia, however today the Javan rhino can be found in only a single nature preserve while the Sumatran rhino has few remaining pockets of surviving population.\nLike other rhino species, the Indian rhinoceros has seen its range dramatically decreased. It lives in tall grasslands and forests near the foothills of the Himalayas mountain range.\nRhino Population \u2014 How Many White Rhinos Are Left?\nThree rhino species \u2013 the black, Sumatran, and Javan \u2013 are listed as \u201cCritically Endangered,\u201d while the Indian rhinoceros is listed as \u201cVulnerable,\u201d and the white rhino is \u201cNear Threatened.\u201d\nAccording to the International Rhino Foundation, in 2019 there is the following populations of each species:\nWhite rhino: 18,000\nBlack rhino: 5,500\nIndian rhino: 3,600\nSumatran rhino: 80\nJavan rhino: 72\nFour out of the five rhino species have seen their populations increase between 2009 and 2019.\nThe lone exception is the Sumatran rhino, which lives in isolated pockets and continues to suffer from poaching. Between 2009 and 2019 it saw its population decrease from an estimated 250 individuals down to fewer than 80.\nExtinct Rhino Species\nNo species of modern rhinoceros has gone extinct. However, numerous subspecies of rhinos have gone extinct in recent years. Historically, there were three subspecies of the Javan rhino, but only one remains after the last surviving Vietnamese Javan rhino was killed in 2010.\nThe Sumatran rhino subspecies in Malaysia was declared extinct in November 2019 after the last male and female died that year. The Northern white rhino is now functionally extinct after the last surviving male died in 2018. In 2011, the Western black rhino was declared extinct. There had been no sighting of the subspecies since 2001.\nThe last rhino species to go extinct was the Woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta), which is believed to have gone extinct around 8,000 BC.\nRhino Predators\nRhinos face few predators in the wild. While juveniles, they can be attacked by large cats like lions or jaguars in addition to crocodiles and other larger predators.\nBeyond the rhino\u2019s imposing horn and significant size, the species also has thick skin that serves as a form of natural \u201cbody armor.\u201d Learn about the strongest animals in the world here.\nThe number one threat to rhinos remains poachers. In South Africa alone, 769 rhinos were poached in 2018. Rhino poaching varies by species, with no Javan rhinos having been poached in more than 25 years as of 2019.\nRhino Diet: what does the animal eat?\nThe rhinoceros is a herbivore and eats grasses, leaves, shoots, buds and fruits in order to gain the nutrients that the rhino needs to grow and survive.\nAlthough the rhino is a herbivore, they are known for their aggressive nature and will often charge towards oncoming predators in order to scare them away. Most rhinoceros individuals that are killed by poachers, are caught out when they are quietly drinking from a water hole and therefore drop their guard. For a complete list of foods rhinos eat, check out our \u201cWhat Do Rhinos Eat?\u201d page.\nRhino Reproduction and Life Cycles\nRhinos have one of the longest gestation periods of all animal species at about 450 days. The longest reported captive gestation period was a white rhinoceros that was 548 days\u2019 gestation (about 18 months).\nThis long gestation period means that rhinos typically don\u2019t give birth again for an additional 3 to 5 years. This long gestation period and extended length between birthing new calves has made repopulating rhinoceroses an especially challenging problem.\nHow long do white rhinos live? The oldest white rhino in captivity lived to 55 while the oldest record of a black rhino was 52 years, and oldest Indian rhino lived to 48. Generally, rhino species can live to be between 35 to 50 years old.\nIncredible Rhino Facts\nAn \u201carmored\u201d animal\nRhinos have unique skin structure and materials that make it quite different from most mammals. Compared to their body size, rhino skin is three times thicker than predicted and contains crosslinked collagen fibers. At its thickest, rhino skin can be about 2 inches (5 cm) thick.\nWhat\u2019s in a rhino horn? The horn of a rhino is made of hair grown tightly together, awhile a natural \u201cglue\u201d from glands on the rhino\u2019s nose packs these hairs tightly together. You may have heard rhino horns are made of the same material as your fingernails, that\u2019s because rhino horns contain tubules of keratin, a protein found across hair, skin, and nails.\nToday, 85% of rhinos live in just one country While rhinos historically roamed across most of sub-Saharan Africa and SE Asia, today an estimated 85% of living rhinos are located in just one country: South Africa.\nFrom a million black rhinos to 5,500 today It was estimated that at the beginning of the 20thcentury more than a million black rhinos lived across Africa, today their population numbers just 5,500 individuals. While that population loss is staggering, the black rhino population continues to rebound.\nWhy did rhino poaching skyrocket? Between 1960 and 1995, 98% of black rhinos were killed by poachers. This upswell in poaching can be traced to China\u2019s Chairman, Mao Zedong, promoting the return of traditional Chinese medicine which utilized rhino horns as a cure. Today, strict bans has slowed rhino horn trade in China, while demand in Vietnam has led to a spike in poaching.\nTwo of the most critically endangered large mammals in the world With less than 100 individuals, the Sumatran rhinoceros and Javan rhinoceros are two of the most critically endangered large mammals in the world. While the Javan rhinos population has stabilized in recent decades, some estimates believes there could be as few as 30 Sumatran rhinos surviving today.\nThere is hope for even the most endangered species Thanks to incredible conservation efforts there are hopes for rhino species. The population of black rhinos has doubled this century. White rhinoceros populations have rebounded from about 50 rhinos to nearly 20,000 individuals. In addition, the Indian rhino has rebounded from less than 100 individuals to a population of about 3,600 today.\nNearly a quarter of rhinos live on private game reserves Today, more than 5 million acres of private game reserves house 6,500 rhinos, or about \u00bc of the entire rhino population.\nIllegal rhino horn trade goes beyond poaching While the illegal trade in rhino horns has led to significant poaching across the past decade, thieves have targeted rhino horns from unusual places. In 2011, thieves robbed a museum in Dublin, stealing four rhino horns from a museum. Its estimated the robbery could be sold for $650,000 on black markets. In addition, in 2011 a rhino horn was stolen from a museum in Ipswich, England. Between 2002-2011 there were more than 20 reported cases of thieves robbing rhino horns from museums.\nFighting Back Beyond protecting rhinos on reserves where rangers and other (often armed) guards can protect rhinos, there are conservations efforts underway to protect rhinos in unique ways like dying their horns with red dyes, 3D printing horns to depress the price of rhino horns, and even introducing rhinos into new environments and private reserves.\nYou can help with the fight to save the rhino There are numerous organizations dedicated to helping rhino conservation efforts. These efforts include Save the Rhino (savetherhino.org) and the WWF (worldwildlife.org)\nView all 71 animals that start with R"}

And what is the difference between a forest, a rain forest and a jungle?\nThe word \"forest\" basically means an area with a large density of trees. Forests can occur in low or high elevation, can be relatively dry or very rainy, and can be of basically any temperature that still supports tree growth.\nA mature forest is one that may have very large trees and many species of plants and wildlife, such as tropical rain forests, or may be limited in the number of species of both trees and wildlife, such as is the case with the coniferous forests found in the taiga regions of the world.\nThe term \"rainforest\" refers to a forest that receives at least 60 inches of rainfall a year.\nThere are two types of rainforests, temperate rainforests with moderate temperatures and even some snowfall, or tropical rainforests which occur close to the equator and rarely dip below 60 degrees.\nRainforests are characterized by having such a thick upper canopy of growth, that little sunlight reaches the ground. This means that young trees must be able to grow with limited sunlight, and it also means that the undergrowth in a rainforest is not particularly dense.\nIt is generally easier to walk through a rainforest than a jungle. A jungle, however, is a different story.\nThe jungle is an area of forest that combines warmer temperatures and dense vegetation. The tree canopy is not as thick in a jungle as it is in a rainforest, allowing sunlight to reach more of the ground.\nVines, shrubs, grasses and moss grow in the lower third of a jungle making it very difficult to penetrate on foot. Jungles are simply warm forests that are very densely vegetated at the forest floor. Rainforests are forests with a great deal of rainfall and very thick vegetation at the canopy.\nAnd here are some of the rain forest animals that live there- Rainforest Animals\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nwhat are the parts of a rainforest?\nFruit Bat\nSquirrel Monkey\nRain forests are divided into very distinct layers of different types of vegetation.These layers are called \"stories\", because, like a building, they are stacked on top of each other.\nThe top floor of the rainforest forms a platform, where the tops of the tallest trees, called emergents, receive the vast majority of sunlight. Larger monkeys may sunbathe or dine on the platform, and bats and birds of prey nest there, keeping watch for small creatures peeking out.\nThe trees at the top can reach over 250 feet in height. These are broad leafed trees that have flat leaves like deciduous trees but are evergreen like coniferous trees.\nBeneath the emergents is the canopy, a section of thick growth that may be as much as 80 feet deep. Within the canopy are the branches, leaves and twigs of the emergent trees, and also large colonies of plants called epiphytes\nEpiphytes are a classification of small plants that grow directly on larger plants without smothering or harming them. These vines, herbs and flowers root right into the trunks of the emergents and thrive in the canopy where they can receive sunlight that they would never be able to get if they rooted in the ground. The epiphyte population, and the number of plant species in the canopy, create a density that begins to block out much of the sun to the understory beneath.\nThe trees in the understory are between 10 and 30 feet high. They are broad-leafed but have fewer limbs, and stretch out thinly to drink up the little spots of sunlight that trickle down through the canopy. Understory trees are able to survive on very limited light, and their saplings can root and begin to grow in the relative darkness of the rainforest floor.\nFinally, the floor of the rainforest, which receives less than 2% of the available sunlight, is a deep rich bed of leaf litter and animal waste. A compost heap that spurs further growth and greenness.\nThe worlds rainforests cover only about 6% of the globe, but provide safe harbor for nearly 60% of all the worlds species. Scientists believe there are literally thousands of undiscovered species of animals, birds reptiles, insects and plants living in the canopy alone. -Rainforest Animals Facts\ncan it snow in a rain forest?\npanda in the snow\nRainforests are forests that receive a large amount of precipitation, but they don't necessarily have to be warm. There are two types of rainforest - temperate and tropical.\nThe tropical rainforest occurs close to the equator and is warm, (usually hot) and rainy year-round.\nThe temperate rainforest occurs farther away from the equator and has seasonal changes including snowfall in some northern areas. In the bamboo rainforests of China, snowfall occurs fairly regularly and accounts for some of the yearly precipitation that qualifies it as a rain forest.\nOne of the world's most beloved animals - the giant panda - lives in the temperate bamboo rainforests of China. The bamboo in these forests is actually the worlds largest species of grass, and not a tree. It makes up the 25 foot to 30 foot high under-story of the rainforest and is the only ecosystem that can provide the giant panda with the kind of food and shelter it requires. - Rainforest Animals\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They spend about 98% of their lives high up in the rainforest canopy and only go down to the forest floor to relieve themselves - about once a week!\nEverything about this animal is designed with tree top living in mind. They have specialized claws that allow them to grip branches effortlessly and they spend the majority of their lives hanging up-side-down. Even the fur of three-toed sloths is special.\nThe fur on the torso and limbs grows in the opposite direction from most other animals. The sloth has a part down the center of its belly, not its back, and all the hairs grow outward from there. The hair on the arms and legs grows up the limbs, toward the body, not away, and the follicles point everything so that when the sloth is hanging upside down from a limb in a rain storm, all the rain flows away from it and towards the ground.\nImagine if it were not designed this way. The rain would get caught and pool up between the rows of hairs and the animals skin.\nBeyond just growing in the opposite direction, the sloths fur is usually has a green tinge, especially during times of high rain. Due to the moisture in the air and the sloths very slow movements, algae is actually able to grow on its fur.\nThe algae provides insulation and camouflage in the green forest. In addition to algae, moss, lichens and even moths and other insects have been known to live in the three-toed sloth's spongy mat of fur. - Rain forest Animals\na few more rain forest Animal facts\nRainforests make up only about 6% of the Earth's land surface.\nOver 60% of all the living species in the world call the rainforest their home\nRainforests plants and trees are evergreen and grow continually.\nMany plants in the rainforest are epiphytes that grow directly out of the trunk of another plant and do not need soil to survive.\nthat grow directly out of the trunk of another plant and do not need soil to survive.

In some areas regulated hunting occurs for the fur trade with record prices for their pelt recorded in recent years. Their habitat has also been expanded as forests are cut down.\nRead on to learn more about these majestic mammals.\nAppearance\nWhat does the Bobcat look like?\nThe bobcat is a medium sized cat. They are named for their tail which is short and bobbed. This measures about 15cm (6in) long and has a black tip.\nThe ears are tipped with a tuft of fur that is said to aid their hearing.\nOn each foot they have short, retractile claws.\nThe fur is coloured tawny, brown, beige, red, black or white. The underside of the bobcat is white as is the space around the lips. The body is patterned with dark spots. On the underside they are completely black. Animals in forests have less of these spots than those in deserts.\nUnlike other lynx species these animals do not have fur on their feet pads and as a result do not have protection when walking on snow.\nBobcats measure 47.5 to 125cm (18.7 to 49.2in) from the head to the beginning of the tail. At the shoulder bobcats stand 30 to 60cm (12 to 24in). Males weigh in at 6.4 to 18.3kg (14 to 40lb) while females are lighter at 4 to 15.3kg (8.8 to 13.7lb).\nThey are the smallest native cat to the United States.\nThese cats become larger the further North that they arrive.\nAdaptations\nHow does the Bobcat survive in its habitat?\nOn top of the ears the bobcat has long ear tufts.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Rabbit Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Rabbit-facts.html", "text": "rabbit Facts\nPortrait of a Rabbit\nThe rabbit is one of the most recognizable and well-loved creatures in the animal kingdom. Domesticated for thousands of years, rabbits are bred for their meat, their fur, and of course, for companionship.\nThere are an estimated 14 million pet rabbits in the world, many of whom live in the classic outdoor wood and chicken-wire hutch, some living in indoor cages, and some clever bunnies learning to use a litter pan and getting the run of the house.\nRabbits are beautiful little animals with many endearing features. They have slender, thin-skinned, towering ears that, in hares, can be 3 times the length of the skull.\nThe ears are amazingly expressive. They can move independently, swivel in almost any direction and can be held erect or folded flat back against the shoulders.\nWhen at ease, rabbits move about in soft little two-beat hops, grazing on vegetation and grooming themselves, cleaning limbs, backs, ears and toes with their short pink tongues.\nThey commonly raise up on their hind legs to inspect their environment, reach tall flowers and leaves, and clean their front paws and faces with the same motions that a house cat uses, except with two paws at the same time.\nRabbits have ever quivering noses, long expressive whiskers, and a powder puff for a tail. Although both rodents and rabbits are small, furry and buck-toothed, rabbits are not in the rodent family.\nRabbits and hares are approximately 50 different species of small herbivorous mammals in the family Leporidae. They are from an order known as lagamorphs, which also includes little mountain-dwelling animals called pikas.\nThere are several major skeletal and systemic differences between lagamorphs and rodents. Lagamorphs have an extra pair of small flat teeth known as \"peg teeth\" in their top jaw, directly behind their incisors.\nan assortment of domestic rabbits\nLagamorphs are basically exclusively vegetarian, while most rodents are opportunity feeders, happily dining on meat whenever it is available.\nMale lagamorphs lack the penile bone that rodents have, and the overall design of the male genitals is different.\nRabbits are found around the world in a variety of environments, but most are woodland creatures who are classically known for living in a burrow - usually a self-dug hole several feet deep with multiple rooms and tunnels known as a \"warren\".\nFinally, rabbits in the wild eat grasses as a dietary mainstay. They will eat many types of vegetation when available, but rarely consume root vegetables like the famous carrots of Bugs Bunny lore. In fact, carrots fed too liberally can actually cause tooth decay in pet rabbits.\nSpeaking of Bugs Bunny, the term \"bunny\" formally refers to a juvenile rabbit, but is often used informally to describe any rabbit, and sometimes in conjunction with the term rabbit as in \"bunny-rabbit\". which is similar to calling a cat a kitty-cat, or your 90 pound Lab a \"puppy-dog\" - it's all good. - Rabbit Facts\nthe domestic rabbits\nAll domestic rabbits are descendants of the European wild rabbit. First farmed in outdoor pens, and possibly barns, by the Romans around 200 years B.C., the European rabbit became a popular and easy source of superior meat and fur.\nCatholic monks living in the Champagne region of France conscientiously and selectively bred, housed, and thus domesticated the European rabbit between 500 and 600 A.D.\nIt is said that some forms of rabbit meat were declared to be fish and were acceptable to eat during Lent, which served as continued motivation for the Monks.\nA few hundred years later, rabbits were being line bred throughout most of Europe. Different regions began to develop specific breeds, and the size, color, and disposition of the animals evolved and expanded over time.\nThe Dutch rabbit, one of the most popular and recognizable breeds of pet rabbit in modern society, can be seen depicted in artwork beginning in the 1400's..\nToday, the American Rabbit Breeders Association, or ARBA, has over 30,000 members and recognizes 45 different breeds of rabbit. Worldwide there are approximately 80 recognized breeds of domestic rabbit, each with its own contribution and traits, from massive New Zealand Giants, regularly considered the finest animals for meat, to the plush coated Rex breeds that are favorites for fur production, to dainty Netherland dwarfs, bred purely for companionship.\nRabbit meat is one of the leanest meats available, with far less fat than beef, pork or chicken. The entire rabbit is considered to be white meat. The rabbit is so lean, in fact, that it is a bit less tasty than other types of meat, and although the reproduction rate of a single doe may lead to her producing up to 200 pounds of rabbit meat in a single year, the meat itself is an acquired taste.\nToday's domestic rabbit is an entirely different animal from the creature that was first captured and corralled in Ancient Rome. So different, in fact, that it is no longer physicallly capable of reproducing with the European wild rabbit it was derived from. - Rabbit Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

There are two families in this order of animals. Rabbits and hares are in the family leporidae, pikas which are smaller and rounder bodied than rabbits with shorter limbs and ears and no tail, are in the family ochotonidae.\nThe rabbit is in a separate genus from the hare, but the differences between the two animals are not obvious or plain to see. In general, hares are larger than rabbits with longer limbs and ears, but many species of hares are remarkably similar in appearance to rabbits.\nAdding to confusion is the fact that probably the most \"hare-like\" example of a hare - the black-tailed jackrabbit- is actually inaccurately called a \"rabbit\".\nThere are, however, substantial differences between rabbits and hares, and their separation by genus is not controversial.\nFirst, hares and rabbits start life very differently. Newborn rabbits are hairless, blind, toothless and completely helpless. They cannot walk, see, or eat solid foods until they are several weeks old.\nNewborn hares on the other hand, not only have their eyes open, they are fully furred and can actually begin foraging and eating solid foods within hours of birth and can survive completely on their own within a few hours of being born.\nOnce out and about, hares and rabbits live surprisingly different lifestyles too.\nRabbits are social creatures living in family units of up to 20 individuals. They dig large, communal homes underground called warrens, where they spend most of their daylight hours, and they eat soft vegetation like grasses and flowers.\nHares are generally solitary animals only coming together for mating. They do not dig warrens, but live above ground their whole lives. Hares have tougher digestive systems, and many live in very harsh environments where they must eat difficult to forage foods that are hard to chew and digest like bark and twigs.\nFinally, many species of hares molt their fur to change colors with the seasons. Rabbits remain the same color all year round, regardless of any changes in weather or environment.\nrabbit reproduction - how can rabbits have so many babies?\nbaby baboons\nRabbits have long been used as symbols of fertility and sexual vigor in many societies. It is mathematically possible for a single pair of rabbits to multiply to about 1300 individuals in the span of just one calendar year.\nWhy and how does the rabbit reproduce at such an amazing rate? Well the why may be because rabbits are very popular food source for a large variety of predators.\nA wild rabbit has a life expectancy of less than 3 years, simply because it is hunted by every predator in its habitat.\nAnd even animals smaller in size and weight than mature rabbits and hares, such as house cats and sparrow hawks will regularly take them, because they offer little defense other than fleeing.\nSo for a bunny, reproducing before you get eaten is the number one plan, and nature has designed the rabbit with several physical characteristic to help with that goal.\nFirst, female rabbits do not have a \"season\" as most mammals do. The female is receptive to the males advances as long as she has unfertilized eggs available, which is about 26 days out of every month. The females hormones are triggered by the act of intercourse, and she ovulates about 10 hours after copulating, so the eggs are released only when sperm are present, and impregnation is virtually guaranteed with a single mating.\nSecond, while hare newborns are almost completely self sufficient the day they are born, rabbits catch up quickly, remaining helpless for the first few days but becoming completely independent and fully weaned at only 4 to 5 weeks. (some variation, of course, between species)\nNext, young rabbits and hares are ready, and often do, mate at as young as 4 months old. Once pregnant, the gestation is a relatively short 29-33 days. Litter size is not extreme compared to many other species - including many breeds of dogs - with a typical litter size of 5 or 6 kits, but some other factors like the speed of development, make up for, and may be the reason for this.\nWithin 2 to 4 days of giving birth, a female rabbit may be receptive to an interested male, and become impregnated again. So it is actually conceivable for one female rabbit to become pregnant every 35 days and deliver up to 10 kits in each litter in the course of 1 year.\nThrow in the idea that the youngsters from her first litter may begin mating at 1 month old, and so on and so on, and you end up with many, many rabbits.\nSome animals, particularly some rodents, have shorter pregnancies, larger litter sizes, and even quicker weaning times, but the combination of all these factors in the rabbit, along with a very strong reproductive drive, gives you the most prolific mammal in the animal kingdom. - Rabbit Facts\npet rabbits\nNetherland dwarf, Dutch, Mini-lop\nAngora rabbits\nRabbits make lovely pets, and have been diligently bred for attractiveness and personality since the 1400's.\nSome modern breeds are so petite that they may be kept happily in a simple hutch indoors, not unlike one might keep a hamster or gerbil. The Netherland dwarf, Dutch, Mini-lop and Angora bunnies are the most popular modern breeds, but there are literally dozens of fine choices for an indoor or outdoor companion.\nSome rabbits pets aren't confined at all, but are given the run of the house once some rabbit-proofing is done to discourage the chewing of furniture and electrical cords. Since the rabbit is a den animal in the wild, its natural tendency is to eliminate in the same place all the time, which facilitates litter-pan training. Of course healthy rabbit feces are relatively dry and pellet-like,so an accident is rarely an issue.\nThe main drawback to rabbits being kept indoors is the odor of wet litter. Rabbits drink lots of water and produce dark, potentially strong-smelling urine, so pans and cages must be cleaned regularly. Male rabbits will occasionally spray urine, similar to male cats, which can be a huge problem.\nSpaying or neutering your pet rabbit is an excellent idea and can eliminate potential issues. Spayed and neutered rabbits are less likely to develop bad toilet habits, have milder smelling urine and feces, will be more gentle and less anxious, and can't reproduce, so you will not be overrun with bunnies if you happen to have a pair.\nIt has been calculated that, do to the rabbits amazing reproductive gifts, if a single pair of healthy rabbits and all of their offspring are left to breed freely, they can expand to 1300 individual rabbits within just one years time!

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Liger images!\nLiger Classification and Evolution\nThe Liger is the largest of the world\u2019s felines, known to grow up to 12ft tall when standing on their hind legs. Created by the mating of a male Lion with a female Tiger, Ligers tend to far exceed the size of both of their parents and although they share similar characteristics with both of them, the Liger tends to be more like a Lion rather than a Tiger.\nRelated: 12 Hybrid Animals That Are Actually Real\nA Tigon is the result of breeding a female Lion with a male Tiger, with this animal tending to be less like a Lion having more Tiger-like qualities. Due to the fact though that Lions and Tigers live in different areas of the world, it is very unlikely that Ligers (or Tigons) are animals that would occur naturally in the wild. Today there are a handful of Ligers found in zoos around the world, which are a result of either accidental or deliberate Human intervention.\nLiger Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Liger is an enormous animal with a large muscular body and broad head. Ligers tend to have sandy or dark yellow fur which is covered in the distinctive faint stripes inherited from their mother. Although other variations in fur colour have been known (including white when their mother is a White Tiger), the Liger generally has a more Lion-like appearance including the manes of the males. Although a Liger\u2019s mane is not as big or as impressive as that of an adult Lion, they can grow quite large on some individuals but it is not uncommon for a male Liger to have no mane at all. Along with their stripes which tend to be most noticeable around their hind quarters, the Liger may also inherit the spots found on the backs of Tiger\u2019s ears along with the tufted fur around their chins.\nLiger Distribution and Habitat\nHistorically it could have been possible although rare, for a male Lion to mate with a female Tiger in the wild to produce Liger offspring. This is because the Asiatic Lion once roamed across a much larger portion of Asia meaning that they could have more easily wandered into a Tiger\u2019s territory. Today however, Tigers are only found in the dense jungles of Asia where they are being pushed into smaller and smaller pockets of their natural habitat. Lions on the other hand, are found patrolling the African grasslands with the exception of the few remaining Asiatic Lions, who are found in a remote forest in India where there are no Tigers. Sadly, although the natural habitat of the Liger would probably be fairly similar to that of a Tiger, the world\u2019s only known Ligers are found in caged enclosures.\nLiger Behaviour and Lifestyle\nDespite their gigantic size and the fact that their parents are two of the planet\u2019s most ferocious predators, the Liger is an animal that is known to have a relatively gentle and docile nature particularly when interacting with handlers. They have however been reported to be slightly confused as to whether or not they are Lions or Tigers as their most bewildering characteristic is the fact that they seem to love water. In the wild, it is not uncommon for Tigers to enter water either to catch prey or to cool down in the heat and so they are naturally good swimmers, which is something that the Liger seems to have inherited. Lions do not like water however and so it is often reported that it does take some time for the Liger to take to its water loving lifestyle. Another odd thing is the fact that the Liger appears to make both Lion and Tiger noises but its roar is more like that of a Lion\u2019s.\nLiger Reproduction and Life Cycles\nMost Ligers are created through the accidental introduction of Lions and Tigers in the same enclosure although it can take up to a year for the two to mate. After mating the male Lion with the female Tiger, the Tiger gives birth to a litter of between 2 and 4 Liger cubs after a gestation period that lasts for about 100 days. As with the young of other large felines, the Liger cubs are born blind and are incredibly vulnerable, relying heavily on their mother for their first 6 months of life. As with Lion cubs, young Ligers have darker spots on their fur which helps to provide them with extra camouflage. However, as with some adult Lions, these spots often remain on Ligers and are most prominent on their underside. Many Liger cubs are sadly born with birth defects and often don\u2019t survive for longer than a week.\nLiger Diet and Prey\nLike the rest of the world\u2019s felines, the Liger is a carnivorous animal meaning that it hunts and kills other animals in order to gain its nutrition. Although the wild diet of the Liger can only be presumed, it is thought to be similar to that of a Tiger mainly hunting larger herbivores including Deer, Wild Boar and (due to their immense size) possibly small or vulnerable Asian Elephants. In captivity they tend to eat an average of 20lbs of meat a day but it is thought that a Liger would easily devour 100lbs worth of food in one sitting. The Liger has an enormous and incredibly strong jaw with sharp, pointed teeth which are ideal for tearing through flesh. Ligers also have very muscular bodies and sharp claws which also help them to catch and eat their prey.\nLiger Predators and Threats\nIf they were found in the wild, the Liger would be the most dominant predator in their environment and would therefore have no natural predators to worry about, with the obvious exception of Humans. Much like Lions and Tigers, Ligers would be subjected to both hunting for trophies and their fur, along with severe habitat loss throughout much of what would be their natural range. In captivity, many Liger cubs are born with fatal birth defects due to the fact that it is the result of cross-breeding of two different species. Another problem to consider is the unnatural nature in which Ligers are both bred and kept all around the world. As it is highly unlikely that Ligers can occur in the wild today, they are merely being bred and kept by zoos in order to make money.\nLiger Interesting Facts and Features\nAlthough like many other hybrids Ligers tend to be sterile, it has been known for a female Liger to be able to produce offspring but a fertile male Liger has never been recorded. She will either be bred with a male Lion or a male Tiger to either produce a litter of Li-Liger or Ti-Liger offspring depending on the species of the father. One of the most famous Ligers is a Hollywood creation named Hercules, who is the offspring of a male Lion and a female Tiger in an institute in Florida. At the age of three he stood at 10ft tall when on his hind legs and weighed half a ton. Another reason as to why Ligers would be rarely produced in the wild is that if a male Lion and a female Tiger came across one another, they are much more likely to fight to defend their territory or avoid one another completely in order to risk getting hurt.\nLiger Relationship with Humans\nThe Liger has been bred by people since the early 19th century when a litter of Liger cubs was born in Asia in 1824. It was more than 100 years however until the next recorded litter which was in a zoo in South Africa just before World War II. Although Ligers are known to be quite even tempered, there remains a great deal of controversy over the cross-breeding of two different animal species, particularly when it is so highly unlikely to occur without Human intervention. Today there are a number of Ligers found in zoos and animal institutes around the world, who are bred (generally by accident) and kept as a money-making attraction.\nLiger Conservation Status and Life Today\nAs there is no real scientific name assigned to the Liger due to the fact that it is made from cross-breeding two separate species artificially, and that is it is not found in the wild, the Liger has no conservation status. The Liger is found in only a handful of enclosures on the planet but they remain frowned upon by many as they do not exist in the wild and therefore have no value as such to conservation. Tigons are more rarely found than Ligers today however, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries there were more of them than there were Ligers. The breeding of Ligers is now banned in a number of countries around the world.\nView all 55 animals that start with L"}

Lions are the only large cats that live and hunt in groups, or prides, with the females doing the majority of the hunting.\nPrides vary greatly in size, but can include up to three males, around a dozen females, and their young, which are raised co-operatively. Typically, the lionesses in the pride will be related to one another, with the female cubs staying with the group for life. Young males leave the pride, often in small cohorts, and live a wandering existence until they may succeed in establishing a pride of their own by driving out and replacing other males.\nMating occurs throughout the year, with females giving birth to a litter of between one and four cubs after a 110-day gestation period.\n*International Union for Conservation of Nature is the world\u2019s main authority on the conservation status of species."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Tarsier Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Tarsier-facts.html", "text": "tarsier Facts\nPortrait of a Tarsier\nOne of the particularly cool tarsier facts, is that each one of their enormous eyes actually weighs more than their brain! The tarsier is a tiny primate with a whole bunch of unique characteristics, and a fossil history that dates back 50 million years.\nIt is a spectacular looking little animal, with enormous eyes, a delicate, elf-like nose and a sweet grin. They have expressive hands and fingers, and freakishly long hind legs folded up under their bellies.\nMost of us have only seen them static, frozen in a photo, or a meme, like a fuzzy brown tennis ball, clinging to a reed. The coiled position they are most often photographed in, makes them look round, maybe even a little plump, however the tarsier is actually a slender, lean athlete, with the longest legs relative to total body size of any animal on Earth.\nThe tarsier is one of the smallest primates, most certainly one of the oldest, and also the only primate that is completely carnivorous. They spend the night hunting for insects, and the occasional reptile or tiny bird, and journey through the forest by springing from tree to tree, using their incredible legs to jump up to 15 feet in one shot, or practically 30 times their body length.\nThe tarsiers body proportions are similar to that of a kangaroo, with shorter front limbs and stretched out hind legs, but in the kangaroo it is mostly the shin - the tibia and the fibula bones - that are elongated. In the tarsier it is the calcaneum and navicular bones of the ankle, also known as the tarsal bones, that are freakishly long, and this is actually where the name tarsier comes from.\nOn the ground, the tarsier hops like a frog, but can also move with a quadrupedal walk. They are usually on the ground for just a few moments while they trap and eat an insect or two, then return to the trees.\nThe hands and feet have tiny, rounded tips, like suction cups. The thumb is not opposable, but the big toe is, and the hind foot is able to rotate drastically to allow grasping of branches in a variety of positions. There are flattened nails on all fingers and toes except the third and fourth toes, which have long, curved claws designed specifically for grooming.\nTarsiers also have a long, mostly naked tail, often with a little tuft of hair on the end, that actually has dermal ridges like a fingerprint on the underside, to provide traction against smooth surfaces. The tail is not prehensile, but acts as a rudder in the air, and like a tripod at rest, allowing the tarsier to sit comfortably on vertical branches.\nAt one time they could be found in many corners of the world, including Europe and North America, but now they live in rainforests throughout Borneo, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\nTarsiers spend most of their time clinging to vertical reeds and branches. The enormous eyes of the tarsier are the largest in proportion to body size of any mammal. The visual cortex, which is the area of the brain devoted to vision, is correspondingly huge.\nThe eyeballs can't move within the eyes sockets, but the neck is designed to allow the head to rotate 180 degrees in either direction, giving them a 360 degree field of vision, just like an owl. No other mammal can swivel their head as far. The eyes lack the reflective quality of many nocturnal animals, which is probably why they need to be so large, and suggests that the tarsiers ancestors were probably active during the daylight.\nWhat is a tarsier?\nThere is lots of confusion and discussion about where to place tarsiers on the primate family tree.. The question is whether they are prosimians, which is how they were originally classified, or apes. Although they look allot like the prosimian lemurs, lorises and bush babys, and have some similar traits like grooming claws and a nocturnal lifestyle, they actually have many more features of apes.\nJust like apes, tarsiers lack a rhinarium, which is the exposed, wet surface around the nostrils found in most mammals, (think of a dog nose), and they don't have the reflective layer in the eye called the tapetum lucidum, that makes many animals eyes glow in the dark. There are aspects of skull structure and dentition that also point to them being more like apes. So in recent years, they have been classified in their own infraorder, with their own family, between these two branches of primates, and are not considered monkeys.\nBut the tarsier has been around for millions more years than any of these other primates and shows no evolutionary link to them. In facts, the tarsier just seemed to spring out of the Miocene age without any clear connection to any other creatures.\nThe first fossil record of the tarsier, is a 50 million year old tarsier, and other than growing a bit smaller, they simply haven't changed that much. This has led many to point to the tarsier as an example of creationism, since science can't even begin to offer an explanation not just of who they are related to, but where they came from in the first place.\ntarsier in the reeds\ntarsier lifestyle\ntarsier with pupils dilated in the dark - taken with quick flash\nThe tarsier is an extremely mysterious little animal that not much is known about.\nEven how many species there are is unknown, since the investigation it takes to identify differences is just not taking place, and the information that is available is greatly disputed.\nCurrently, there are considered to be anywhere between 6 and 26 different species depending on the source. The species vary only slightly in lifestyle, vocalizations, eye and ear size, and they also have different lengths and amounts of hair on their tails.\nThe vocalizations have come to be a reasonable source in identifying different species. Once thought to be a very quiet animal, there have been recent insights into their communication habits.\nThe tarsier is one of the few animals that is considered to \"sing\", meaning they repeat melodic notes in sequence, like birds. But it's only recently been discovered that tarsiers make ultrasonic noises - sounds that are so high in frequency that the human ear can't hear them.\nThis discovery is a bit embarrassing for researchers, because tarsiers often open their mouths in large gapes that looked like silent screams. Long explained away as yawns by scientists, they actually are screams, usually warning calls, that we just can't hear.\nLike a tree falling in a forest, observers believed their own sensory experience was the only one that counted. After it was discovered several years ago that elephants communicate in sounds too low for us to hear, now some specific investigation is long overdue into the possible communications going on of animal species that are above or below our own audio abilities.\nTarsiers sleep during the day, clinging to a vertical tree branch or vine. They don't build nests, but some species, like the spectral tarsier, like to sleep in hollow trees. They wake at sunset and set out swiftly across their territory to hunt a variety of insects including grasshoppers and beetles. They mark the perimeters of their territories with urine, and will defend it from other groups, although territories do overlap.\nThe tarsier uses its excellent vision and keen hearing to hunt. The ears are constantly twitching and rotating to catch sounds of possible prey, and its head swivels to locate it. The tarsier will open its eyes as wide as possible to focus on a target up in the trees or on the jungle floor. Most photos of tarsiers are taken in daylight, so the pupils are tiny, and the gold/green eye color is prominant, but in the dark of night the pupil is huge and nearly fills the eye.\nOnce dinner is spotted the tarsier may adjust its body position, or move a step closer, measuring the distance, then pounces on its prey, trapping it with its hands and holding it up to its mouth to consume. They have very sharp teeth, and the mouth is very large, spanning across the width of the face.\nSpeaking of the face, tarsiers have very expressive ones. Their upper lips have musculature similar to our own, and the tarseier is capable of making all kinds of human expressions, including grinning from ear to ear. The face doesn't really have a muzzle either, just a small, upturned nose, book-ended by those gigantic eyes - spectacular!\nPhilippine Tarsier\ntarsier facts on reproduction\nTarsier species have different breeding habits, but generally the female comes into estrus once a month. Many of these animals appear to be monogamous, mating for life and living in little groups that include a few offspring. Some species seem to be more solitary, getting together at some point during the day, but otherwise eating and sleeping alone.\nThe female is pregnant for about 6 months and gives birth to a single infant that is about 1/3 her size. That's about the same as a woman who weighs 120 pounds, giving birth to a 40 pound infant! The baby is born eyes open and furred, but takes a few days to gain mobility. Tarsier mothers \"park\" their babies on a tree limb, since they are too large to carry around, and hunt a few feet away. In some species, males play a minor role, keeping closer when there is an infant present, and providing some defense from predators.\nTarsiers have been observed to \"mob\" predators such as snakes, with up to 10 individuals coming together for coordinated attacks, leaping towards and striking at the intruder. A males prowess during these displays may make him more desirable to mate with.\nTarsier babies wean quickly, and by 4 to 6 weeks they are hunting for themselves. Young may stay with the family group for 2 years or more before leaving. Some species form monogamous pairs, some form groups with one male and a few females.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

This allows them to be able to catch their prey or escape from a predator. Webbed feet allows animals not to expend too much energy when they swim Examples: Polar Bears, Ducks, Otters, Beavers\nSharp Claws Helps herbivores in digging for berries, tubers, and roots Carnivores use their claws to tear meat apart from their prey Increases traction, increasing running speed Examples: Bears, Harpy Eagles, Sloths, Koalas\nWhiskers Serve as sensors or feelers that helps an animal determine whether or not it will fit through a certain space. Helps sense nearby prey Examples: Tigers, Seals, Walruses, Beavers\nSharp teeth Usually found in carnivores, sharp teeth allow for the piercing and tearing apart of prey. Used as a weapon for self-defence Symbol of power and dominance in a food chain Examples: Lions, Coyotes, Alligators, Gorillas\nWings Aid in movement. Usually, wings help birds fly to move from one place to another, but in some case wings serve as flippers that aid in swimming movements. Examples: peregrine falcons, golden eagles, Penguins\nLarge Beak Aids in capturing prey Helps in the mastication of meat or plants Examples: Toucans, Rhinoceros hornbill\nHooves Observed in large animals Allows animal to quickly maneuver through rocky, rough, and hot grounds without facing injury. Examples: Zebras, Dall sheep\nStriped Fur Aids in camouflage Examples: Tigers, Zebras, Chipmunks\nBrightly colored feathers Aids in camouflage against a backdrop of trees or flowers Helps attract mates therefore aiding in reproduction Examples: Peacocks.\nScales Provide protection from environment and predators Aids in mobility of an animal Examples: Iguanas. Crocodiles\nSpotted fur Similar to striped fur, it aids in an animals blending in with its environment Examples: Jaguar, Snow Leopard\nBEHAVIOURAL ADAPTATIONS\n2 types of Behavioral Adaptations: Innate: Also called instinctive behaviours. It is naturally done by an animal without it having to be taught to them. Learned: behaviour that must be taught. It modifies itself through experience and exposure to the environment.\nMigration Periodic or seasonal migration/movement of animals from one habitat to another. It is done either as a response to changes in climate, availability of food, or for reproduction Innate behavior. Examples: whales, geese\nHibernation a state of minimal activity and decreased levels of metabolic activity in order to save energy Innate behavior. Examples: bears, bats\nLiving with a group Is a form of protection from predators Movement and reproduction is easier to conduct Innate behavior. Examples: Fish, lions\nTool use Use of surrounding objects (such as branches and rocks) for eating, building shelter, and defense Learned behavior. Examples: birds building nests, monkeys using rocks to open nuts\nRaising young Animals nurse their offsprings until they are ready to live as independently Ensures continuation of species Innate behavior. Examples: Ducks, Elephants\nCommunicating Allows for animals to call for help Used as mating signals Mixture of innate and learned behavior Examples: Wolves, peacocks\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS\nProduction and secretion of venom Protect animals from their predators. Venom paralyzes and kills, but it also aids in digestion Examples: Cobras, scorpions\nRelease of antifreeze proteins Protects animals from extremely low body temperatures Examples: Bears, Bats\nWell-developed olfactory systems Helps animals detect prey or predators within the proximity Examples: Porcupines, Anteaters\nStoring of fat/ Blubber Regulates animals\u2019, sea mammals in particular, body temperature Examples: Whales, seals\nAnimal Adaptations Worksheets\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the animal adaptations across 28 in-depth pages.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Cheetah - The Animal Facts - Habitat, Appearance, Breeding, Diet", "url": "https://www.theanimalfacts.com/mammals/cheetah/", "text": "Appearance\nThe cheetah has a streamlined body covered with fur that ranges from light tan to gold. This is covered with solid black spots. These spots distinguish them from jaguars or leopards who have open rosettes which look like a ring.\nA variant known as the king cheetah exists which has larger spots and on the back these merge to form stripes.\nTheir head is small and the muzzle is short. These features are adaptations that help them when running at high speed. Their nostrils are large to allow them to take in additional air. Running from the eye, which is amber coloured, down the face and under their mouth is a thin black stripe. This may help reflect glare and to focus on prey when running.\nOn the tail is five to six black rings and the tip is coloured either white or black. The tail serves as a signal for cubs to follow and as a rudder to change direction when running.\nThey have long, thin legs and on each foot they have semi-retractable claws.\nTheir length is between 1 and 1.5m (45-60in) long and they stand 76cm (30in) tall at the shoulder. A cheetah\u2019s weight is between 20 and 72kg (45-160lbs).\nDiet\nThe cheetah is a carnivorous species. Most of their diet is medium sized gazelles. In addition they will eat birds and other small mammals like rabbits.\nWith the expansion of human habitations they have begun to eat some livestock but most of what they take is older and sick animals that are easy to catch.\nThey use their high speed to catch prey. As a result once they catch food they often need to rest and during this time scavengers may steal their food with the cheetah unable to do much to prevent this.\nCheetahs can go long periods without drinking. They can last up four days without water."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Quokka - The Animal Facts Diet, Adaptations, Behaviour, Habitat and More!", "url": "https://www.theanimalfacts.com/mammals/quokka/", "text": "Meet the World's Happiest Animal!\nOn an island off the coast of Western Australia lives the quokka, often known as the world's happiest animal due to the way they seem to smile in photos. As such their home on Rottnest Island has become popular with tourists looking to snap a selfie.\nAs a marsupial quokkas raise their joey in a pouch and are carried with their mother for the first few months of life. They have gained an unfortunate reputation as bad mothers which will throw their baby at predators if threatened. This is not quite correct. Mothers instead may just drop their infants when fleeing inadvertently.\nUnfortunately introduced predators such as the red fox and cats along with habitat destruction have all contributed to the decline in the population of quokkas.\nRead on to learn more about the weird quirks of the quokka.\nAppearance\nWhat does a quokka look like?\nThe quokka has a coarse brown coat that becomes lighter on the underside. On the face and neck are some reddish tinges. These animals appear like a small, stocky kangaroo with rounded ears. In comparison to other wallaby\u2019s their hind legs are short. Their small nose is black in color.\nThis adaptation helps them to hop quickly through tall brush and grass. Their rounded nose is tipped with a black nose.\nAt the end of the body is a short, round, hairless tail which measures between 25 and 30cm (9.8-11.8in) long.\nQuokkas measure 40-90cm (16-35in) long with an average weight of 2.5-5kg (5.5-11lb). Males are typically larger than females.\nAdaptations\nHow does a quokka survive in its habitat?\nThe quokka has a light brown coat which helps them to blend in with the grass that makes up most of their habitat.\nTheir short, round tail and strong back legs help them to hop quickly through their environment. The tail also acts as a store of fat which they can draw on during periods of food scarcity.\nQuokkas are active at night which helps them to avoid many of their natural predators which are active during the day."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Aardwolf images!\n\u201cAardwolves play a positive role in the ecosystem by limiting the number of termites throughout their natural range.\u201d\nThe aardwolf is the lesser-known cousin of the striped and spotted hyenas. Because it\u2019s shy, elusive, and nocturnal, it\u2019s rarely encountered by people.\nThe name aardwolf essentially means earth wolf in the Afrikaans and Dutch languages, but this is misleading because it\u2019s not a wolf at all. Instead, it belongs to the hyena family, a fact which is fairly obvious from its appearance alone. It looks quite a bit like a striped hyena, whose African habitat overlaps with its own. This article will cover some interesting facts about the identification, diet, habitat, and behavior of the aardwolf.\nAardwolf vs Hyena\nAs just mentioned, the aardwolf is a member of the hyena family, and its appearance is quite similar to a hyena. The main differences are that the aardwolves are generally smaller in body size, they live in smaller groups of family units, and they consume insects rather than carrion or larger prey.\n3 Incredible Aardwolf Facts!\nAardwolves are thought to be an example of a \u201cprimitive\u201d hyena. This essentially means they may have evolved from a very early branch of the hyena family before the other three species came to be. Based on genetic and fossil evidence, they probably diverged from the rest of the hyena family at some point between 15 and 32 million years ago. It was once thought that the aardwolf may not be a hyena at all, but rather a closely related species mimicking the appearance of the striped hyena to trick potential predators, but this explanation has fallen out of favor as scientists have gathered more evidence.\nBecause aardwolves are specifically adapted for eating termites, some of their teeth have evolved into blunt pegs, barely even capable of chewing meat. Their powerful jaws are used to defend territory instead.\nAn alternative name for this species is maanhaar-jackal, which means mane-jackal in Dutch, even though it isn\u2019t closely related to jackals at all.\nScientific Name\nThe scientific name of the aardwolf is Proteles cristata. The genus name Proteles, which essentially means \u201ccomplete in front\u201d in Greek, refers to the fact that it has five toes on the front limbs and only four on the hind limbs. Cristata comes from a Latin word that means a comb or tuft on the head of an animal (referring to its luxurious mane). The aardwolf is the only living member of its entire genus. Together with the brown hyena, spotted hyena, and striped hyena, it is a member of the family Hyaenidae. It was once placed in its own separate family, but this is no longer considered to be correct.\nAppearance\nThe aardwolf might be accidentally mistaken for a hyena if you don\u2019t know what key identification markers to look for. The most prominent feature is the strong dark stripes against a backdrop of brown or yellow fur with additional black markings around the feet, tail, and muzzle. It also has a thick mane running from the head to the tail and large triangle-shaped ears. However, compared with most hyenas, it also has five toes on the front feet instead of four. Most members of the species are about three feet long and weigh between 17 and 31 pounds. This makes them the smallest member of the hyena family. Males and females look almost identical in coloration and size.\nThe aardwolf is commonly mistaken as a wolf but it is actually part of the hyena family. iStock.com/slowmotiongli\nBehavior\nBecause of their shy and elusive behavior, there is still a lot about the aardwolves we don\u2019t yet understand. For a long time, it was thought that the aardwolf was a solitary creature. But in fact, as we\u2019ve since learned, the basic unit of the aardwolf\u2019s social life appears to be the family, which consists of a breeding pair and their immediate offspring. There is little evidence it forms larger packs or groups for long periods. The breeding pair raises the offspring together nearly all year long and defends their territory against outside aggressors. They may create as many as 10 dens, as well as several waste disposal areas, within their territory. The den is usually composed of a simple hole, crevice, or abandoned porcupine or aardvark burrow in the ground.\nAardwolves do most of their communicating with the scent markings of their anal gland. This scent is smeared all over foliage to mark their territory and attract mates. They tend to make very few sounds unless they are threatened or startled. The only exceptions are some clucking, barking, and roaring sounds. If it\u2019s in direct danger, then the hairs on the back of the mane will stand up and it may emit a foul-smelling substance from the anal gland. The aardwolf may also chase the intruder out of its territory, but given the slow speed, it may prefer to let the intruder go. Only when the aardwolf is faster will it overtake the other animal and instigate a fight.\nDespite the strong bond between the mating pair, the aardwolf appears to do most of its foraging alone without the help of its partner. As a nocturnal animal, it comes out at night to do most of its feeding, and then it retreats to the underground den during the daylight hours to avoid the withering heat. This behavior may change during the winter months when it comes out for some time in the afternoon and then sleeps at night. There is some evidence to suggest that the aardwolf may share part of its territory or hunt in small groups when food is particularly scarce. This maximizes their chances of finding food.\nHabitat\nThe aardwolf prefers to inhabit dry open savannas and grasslands with minimal annual rainfall. It can be found in two separate disconnected places: the eastern horn of Africa around Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, and the southern portion of Africa around Angola, Zambia, and South Africa. There is some debate about whether these eastern and southern populations should be considered as entirely separate subspecies because apart from their distinctive ranges, they are otherwise similar.\nPredators and Threats\nThe aardwolf faces few significant threats in the wild because they generally keep to themselves and don\u2019t bother humans too often. However, sometimes they are in danger of falling victim to hunting, motor accidents, and habitat loss from encroaching human habitats.\nWhat Eats the Aardwolf?\nAdult aardwolves have few serious predators in the wild, but the aardwolf puppy is vulnerable to jackals, lions, leopards, and other hyenas. Hunting dogs will also sometimes attack and kill the aardwolf.\nWhat Does the Aardwolf Eat?\nAardwolves may look like fearsome predators, but their diet consists almost solely of termites. After locating the termite mounts through scent and sound, the aardwolf will dig up the quarry with its sharp claws. It will then lick the termites right off the ground with their long sticky tongue. It\u2019s estimated that a single individual can consume around 300,000 termites every single night. The termites also supply them with most of the water they need in their otherwise dry and arid habitats. Aardwolves are immune to the toxins that these termites produce to stop other predators from eating them. If termites are not available, then they might consume beetles and other insects. Contrary to expectation, they do not appear to scavenge for carrion at all like other hyenas, butt they might consume insects right off a dead body.\nReproduction and Life Cycle\nThe aardwolf\u2019s mating season can conceivably take place at any time of the year, but depending on where it lives, breeding often peaks in the rainy months. To attract a potential mate, both males and females will secrete a pungent scent from the anal gland. If the female accepts what the male has to offer, then they will form pair bonds together and produce a single litter per year. However, the most aggressive males may intrude on another territory and copulate with the mate of a weaker male as well.\nAfter a gestation period lasting approximately 90 days, the mother will give birth to a litter of two to five pups with their eyes open but otherwise helpless. They will remain safe and protected in the underground den, feeding on the mother\u2019s milk for the first three to four months of their lives. The father has the responsibility of guarding the den, while the mother will make foraging trips outside. When the offspring are fully weaned, each puppy will be fed regurgitated termites until they\u2019re old enough to hunt on their own.\nThese foraging trips become progressively bolder and farther from the den with each passing month. The aardwolf puppy will continue to learn and grow under the supervision of the parents for the first year. After that, they leave the family to stake out their territory. Most aardwolves achieve full sexual maturity at around 1.5 to two years of age. The lifespan of the aardwolf isn\u2019t exactly known, but other closely related hyena species can live about 15 years or more in the wild.\nPopulation\nAardwolves are considered to be a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. This means numbers are healthy and they require no special conservation efforts. It is not known how many aardwolves live throughout their entire range, in part because their elusive and nocturnal behavior makes it hard to estimate. Based on the aardwolf\u2019s behavior, however, we know that population densities are quite low. A single breeding pair can occupy territory as large as 1 to 4 square kilometers (0.4 to 1.5 square miles). The male will defend his territory both in and out of the breeding season.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}

About 2,500 live in this state, double the populations of the early 1980s, and their numbers are growing.\nDescription: Cougars are carnivores. They are elusive, secretive animals rarely seen in the wild. Although their usual prey is deer and other wildlife, it is possible, although rare, for them to perceive humans as prey.\nThe animal is identified by its large size, cat-like appearance, uniformly gray to reddish-tan body color, and long tail - nearly three feet (1 m) long and a third of its total length. The muzzle and chest are white and there are black markings on the face, ears and tip of the tail. Cougar kittens are mottled with black spots and have ringed tails until they are about 6 months old.\nThe cougar is the second largest cat in the New World. (The jaguar is the largest.) An adult cougar can range in length from 42 to 54 inches, with a 3-foot-long tail. Adult males weigh up to 200 pounds, and adult females up to 120 pounds.\nLike all members of the cat family, cougars have five digits on the forepaw and four on the hindpaw. Each digit is equipped with a claw, which the cougar sheathes while walking, but which it uses with deadly effectiveness when grasping its prey. The front feet and claws are larger than their counterparts in the rear - adaptations for clutching large prey.\nDistribution: Other than humans, cougars are the most widely distributed land mammal in the Western Hemisphere. Cougars range from northwestern Canada to Patagonia, South America.\nClick on a range map to see where cougars live in Washington.\nHabitat: Cougars normally are reclusive animals which avoid humans. They make their dens in rocky outcroppings, dense thickets and under uprooted trees. They are highly territorial\u2014 a male cougar may dominate a home range of 50 to 150 square miles (for comparison, the City of Seattle is 92 square miles).\nDiet: Cougars are carnivores. Their main prey are different species of ungulates, including moose, elk, white-tailed deer, mule deer, and caribou in North America. They also eat smaller creatures like squirrels, muskrat, porcupine, beaver, raccoon, striped skunk, coyote, bobcats, other cougars, rabbits, opossums, birds, and even snails and fish. They may also prey on domestic livestock, including poultry, calves, sheep, goats, and pigs. (source: ADW)\nA male cougar living in the Cascade Mountains kills a deer or elk every 9 to 12 days. They eat up to 20 pounds of meat at a time then bury the rest for later.\nReproduction and Development: Cougars begin breeding at about 3 years of age and may mate during any season. Typical litters of 1 to 6 kittens are born after a gestation period of 82 to 98 days. Their eyes open in 8 or 9 days and the young are weaned in 2 to 3 months, though the kittens may remain with the mother into their second year.\nTracks: Cougar tend to leave \"soft\" tracks, meaning the animals make very little impact on the ground, and their tracks may be virtually invisible on packed earth. Cougars keep their claws retracted most of the time, which preserves sharpness, so claw marks are rarely visible in their tracks. The paw print can be visible in snow (see photo).\nLife Span: Male cougars can live 10 to 12 years in the wild. Females normally live longer than males.\nNatureMapping - Project CAT (Cougars and Teaching) Project CAT in designed to provide collaborative research on cougars in rural and suburban settings to better understand cougar-human interactions. K-12 students, teachers and local community members will assist researchers in this extensive study of regional cougar populations.\nLearn more >>\nMountain Lion video\nDid you know?"}

They are carnivores that can subdue and eat large mammals. This crocodile lives in various places throughout sub-Saharan Africa as well as in the Nile basin and western Madagascar. These reptiles communicate with one another by hissing and growling. They can live to be at least 45 years old in the wild.\n5 Incredible Nile Crocodile Facts!\nBoth crocodile parents stay with their nest of eggs to protect their young from predators\nIt\u2019s estimated that 200 people are killed each year by Nile crocodiles\nThese crocodiles can swim at a speed of 22mph\nThe bite force of this crocodile is five times stronger than a lion\u2019s\nThe Nile crocodile is the largest crocodile in Africa\nNile Crocodile Scientific Name\nThe scientific name of this crocodile is Crocodylus niloticus. Crocodylus comes from the Greek word meaning lizard and niloticus means from the Nile River. It belongs to the Crocodylidae family and the class Reptilia.\nThere are two species of Nile crocodile including the east African Nile crocodile and the west African Nile crocodile.\nNile Crocodile Appearance & Behavior\nA Nile crocodile looks a lot like a giant lizard. Its body is covered in tough scales that are grayish-brown or olive in color. In addition, this reptile has crossbands of dark scales covering its powerful tail. The Nile crocodile has four short legs along with clawed feet. Their back feet are webbed making them excellent swimmers. They have green eyes with vertical pupils specially designed to help them see in their watery environment at night.\nOne of the most fearsome things about the Nile crocodile is its size. They grow to an average length of 16 feet but can measure as long as 20 feet. They weigh from 500 pounds to 1,650 pounds! As a comparison, from its nose to the tip of its tail a 20-foot crocodile is the same length as three-fourths of a London bus! A 1,650-pound Nile crocodile is equal in weight to half of an average car. No wonder these reptiles are so confident when attacking large prey!\nA Nile crocodile named Gustave is the largest one on record at over 20 feet long.\nNile crocodiles are also known for their ability to burrow. They use their clawed feet to burrow so they can go underground if the weather becomes too cold or hot for them to survive. Some of these burrows are 12 feet deep while others are close to 40 feet deep. These reptiles retreat into their burrow and go into a state similar to hibernation called aestivation. During aestivation, a crocodile\u2019s heart beats just twice a minute!\nThis crocodile uses its teeth and tremendous bite force to grab onto its prey. Its bite force can be as strong as 5,000 Ibf. Lbf refers to the weight (lbs.) of the crocodile and the force of its bite. Think of it this way. The force, or strength of a Nile crocodile\u2019s bite is five times more than the bite force of an adult lion.\nThe dark scales of these crocodiles help them to blend into their environment. However, adult Nile crocodiles have no predators except humans. Their ability to blend into their environment helps them when stalking and attacking their prey.\nOne of the most interesting facts about this reptile is it can be both solitary and social. They may hunt alone or work with other Nile crocodiles to trap and eat a school of fish. Also, Nile crocodile parents work together to protect their eggs from predators. These crocodiles can sometimes coexist in the same territory.\nA gathering of four or five crocodiles lying in the sun on shore is called a bask. Alternatively, a group of crocodiles swimming together is called a float.\nDue to their size, these crocodiles are aggressive and have no hesitation in attacking large mammals and humans near the shoreline.\nNile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) swallowing an Impala \u2013 Kruger National Park (South Africa)\nNile Crocodile vs Saltwater Crocodile\nWhen comparing the Nile crocodile to the saltwater crocodile the first thing to note is the saltwater crocodile is the larger of the two. In fact, the saltwater crocodile holds the title as the biggest crocodile in the world. The Nile crocodile is the second largest.\nAnother difference between these two crocodiles is the Nile crocodile lives in freshwater habitats in Africa. The saltwater crocodile lives in southeast Asia, northern Australia, and eastern India.\nNot surprisingly, these two gigantic crocodiles have some things in common as well. For one, they both have a diet of fish along with birds and large mammals. Both types can live 45 plus years in the wild and even longer in captivity. Also, both crocodiles have a tremendously strong bite force.\nNile Crocodile Habitat\nThese reptiles live in sub-Saharan Africa, the Nile basin and western Madagascar. Specifically, they live in freshwater swamps, mangrove swamps, rivers, estuaries, and large lakes. These cold-blooded reptiles live in a moderate climate and rely on the sun to keep them warm. They spend most of the day basking in the sun without moving. If a crocodile starts to get too hot in the sun, it opens its mouth to let excess heat pour out and evaporate. In the evening, they go back into the water to hunt and cool off. When the weather gets too cold for them to survive, these reptiles dig a burrow and go into aestivation underground.\nSome Nile crocodiles migrate to different areas to find a larger food supply or to find a suitable place to make a nest.\nNile Crocodile Predators and Threats\nNile crocodiles are carnivores. They usually hunt in the evening and at night. This crocodile can consume a supply of food equal to half its body weight. So, a 1,000-pound Nile crocodile could eat a 500-pound zebra during a single meal.\nWhat eats a Nile crocodile?\nAn adult Nile crocodile doesn\u2019t have any natural predators. Humans are the only threat to them. However, baby Nile crocodiles fall victim to many predators including Nile monitor lizards, African fish eagles, snakes, and honey badgers.\nOne threat to this crocodile is habitat loss due to land development. In addition, they sometimes become entangled in commercial fishing nets and die. Poaching is another threat to these crocodiles. They are hunted for their meat and eggs.\nWhat does a Nile crocodile eat?\nBeing the biggest crocodile in Africa means this reptile has a lot of prey to choose from. Nile crocodiles eat a variety of fish. They are also known for attacking large mammals such as zebras, buffalo, antelope, and even small hippos.\nA Nile crocodile is able to remain very still watching a mammal such as a zebra or an antelope taking a drink from a river or lake. Though these crocodiles are large, they are also very fast. They dart up out of the water and clamp down on their prey using their tremendous bite force to hold and subdue it.\nThis crocodile has a conservation status of Least Concern with a stable population.\nNile Crocodile Reproduction and Life Cycle\nThe mating period of this crocodile happens during the dry season. Male crocodiles try to attract females by splashing with their snouts, spraying water, and making growling sounds. Once the strongest male drives all the others away, the female and male mate. Most male crocodiles mate with many females during breeding season. But the male Nile crocodile stays with a female to guard their nest of eggs. That\u2019s one of the most unusual facts about this crocodile. As a general rule, most reptiles lay their eggs and leave them.\nThe female digs a burrow about 20 inches deep to serve as a nest for her eggs. She lays 25 to 80 eggs in the burrow and pushes sand over them. The eggs are about 3 inches long and weigh a few ounces. The incubation period is around 90 days.\nBaby crocodiles are called hatchlings. If a hatchling is having trouble breaking out of its egg, the female crocodile may put it in her mouth and roll it around to help with the hatching process. Once the eggs hatch, the female takes the hatchlings into her mouth and carries them to the water. Hatchlings can see, walk, and swim from birth. They stay with their mother for the first two months of life. During that time, the hatchlings learn to capture insects and small fish. Though the mother crocodile gives them protection, hatchlings are vulnerable to many predators.\nThe typical prey of these crocodiles increases in size as the crocodile grows. So, by the time this reptile reaches adulthood, it\u2019s eating large mammals.\nThese crocodiles can live 45 years or more in the wild. These reptiles live even longer in captivity. Henry, a Nile crocodile living in South Africa, is believed to be the oldest at 120 years old!\nNile Crocodile Population\nScientists estimate the population of these crocodiles at 50,000 to 70,000 mature individuals. Their conservation status is Least Concern with a stable population.\nInterestingly, there have been a few of these crocodiles seen and captured in the Everglades in Florida. It seems very strange that crocodiles from Africa should show up in south Florida! Biologists have some theories as to how these crocodiles arrived in the Everglades. The main theory is reptile collectors illegally sold hatchlings to people in the United States. Before long, the crocodiles got too big for their owners to care for. Consequently, they were released into the Florida Everglades.\nView all 39 animals that start with N"}

The common opossum, also known as the Virginia opossum, is a somewhat maligned but fascinating creature.\nWhat is a possum? Well, it is not a rodent, although it resembles a very large and slightly eerie looking rat, with a scruffy coat of coarse grey and white fur, and a flesh-bare tail. The common opossum lives in trees, can hang by its prehensile tail, and is the only non-primate to have opposable big toes, but it is not a monkey.\nThe opossum is actually a marsupial, which means opossum babies are raised in a pouch on the mothers belly, just like a kangaroo. The word opossum comes from the Algonquin Indian language, and is said to mean \"white animal.\" The \"o\" is sometimes silent, and is often left out all together.\nIn fact, possum without the \"o\" is the common spelling and pronunciation throughout much of the United States, and there is little confusion in those circles when referring to the American animal, although it is scientifically inaccurate.\nThere are about 70 different species of marsupials called \"possums\" found in Australia and Indonesia, which are members of the zoological families Phalangeridae and Petauridae, including brush-tail possums and the little sugar glider often kept as a pet.\nAnd there are over 100 species of marsupials called \"opossums\" found in the Western hemisphere, which are members of the family Didelphimorphia, including the common or Virginia opossum we will be covering here.\nopossum rabies\nFacts about possums often include claims that they are disease-carrying dangerous creatures. However, the Center for Disease Control reports that in the United States, the vast majority of recorded rabies cases come from the bite of 4 animals - raccoons, skunks, foxes and bats.\nRabies is a terrible virus that attacks brain function.\nSometimes, infected animals act erratically and show disturbing symptoms such as drooling, disorientation and aggression, but it can also be carried and transmitted by some animals without them ever actually contracting the disease, or showing any unusual behavior\nOften, the first sign that an animal has rabies is a change in behavior patterns. When people see opossums out and about during daylight hours, they assume there is something wrong with the normally nocturnal animal. If you approach a opossum, they will greet you with a startling defense display, gaping their mouths wide, hissing and writhing in an attempt to intimidate, and this can be misinterpreted as rabid behavior.\nEven the opossums classic defense of playing dead adds fuel to the perception that there is something very wrong, especially when they pick their head up to check if the coast is clear and then fling themselves back on the ground again if it isn't.\nBut despite all their weird behavior, it is considered very rare for the common opossum to contract, carry or transmit rabies. It seems the rabies virus thrives in animals with higher body temperatures than that of the possum. For instance, the normal body temperature of a raccoon is 102.8, while the opossums average body temperature is about 95 degrees, sometimes less.\nThis does not mean they are immune from rabies however, and a handful of opossum rabies cases are reported pretty much annually.\nBut, the common possum is a carrier of leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that appears to be a simple flu, but, If left untreated, can cause kidney damage, liver failure, respiratory complications and even meningitis. Leptospirosis is spread through the opossums urine and excrement, so keeping outside surfaces they may frequent clean, and making sure your pets are protected from exposure is a good idea. And if you see a possum out in your yard in the middle of the day, just assume it is out for a little stroll, but keep your distance anyway!\nwhat do opossums eat?\nopossum in garden\n\"playing opossum\"\nWhat possums eat has much to do with where they live. In rural or wild areas, they may be limited to local fauna and flora, but in towns and cities, they enjoy a host of foods provided by the humans that live there.\nAn extremely successful animal that has existed for thousands of years, the opossum has an impressive array of 50 teeth, designed both for ripping and grinding. Although they will often bare their teeth in a bluff display to ward off predators, they are really eaters, not fighters.\nWith large canines, pointy incisors, and powerful molars and premolars, the completely omnivorous opossum is prepared to consume practically anything.\nThe common possum is an intelligent, resourceful opportunist, and will eat fruits, vegetables, roots, tubers, worms, insects, small rodents, reptiles, carrion and roadkill.\nThey may raid garbage dumps and garbage cans, gardens, ponds and even chicken coops.\nThey don't just scavenge, but will actively hunt small birds and animals, and vigorously dig up insects they detect below ground or in hollow logs. They will use their strong claws and dexterous front paws to rip open burrows, have been known to hunt and eat rats, and will open food bins to get to goodies like dog kibble and cat food.\nOne of the most remarkable things possums eat are ticks. In fact, most opossums will remove and eat 90% of the ticks that try to bite them. A healthy opossum population can actually reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases such as Lymes, due to their unusual tick-hunting abilities.\nopossum!\nopossum babies\nThe opossum is the only marsupial found in North America, meaning, like kangaroos and koalas, the female opossum carries her young in a pouch.\nOpossums are generally solitary animals that come together only to mate. After just 12 days or so (the shortest pregnancy of any mammal in North America) the female gives birth to as many as 18 babies, called neonates, because they are still in an embryonic from.\nThey are incredibly small, only about the size of a raisin, and must make their way to the mothers pouch to continue to develop. Immediately after birth they are compelled to move in an involuntary swimming motion, across the mothers belly to her pouch, a trip of about 4 inches. Eyes and ears are not open, but their sense of smell guides them, and the mother opossum will lick her belly, making a trail for the opossum babies to follow.\nThe mother does not help them to the pouch, and some believe this may be a way of weeding out weaker babies. When they reach the pouch, called a marsupium, they latch on to a teat. Once latched on, the teat fills with milk, and the baby opossums are basically locked in place for 8 to 10 weeks as they continue to develop, protected from the outside environment.\nThe babies are remarkably safe inside the pouch, and are often found unharmed, even after the mother has been hit by a car. It is recommended that one always check the pouch for baby opossums in the event that a dead adult is found.\nOnce the opossum babies, called joeys, are old enough, they will ride on their mothers back, clinging with strong claws and their little prehensile tails.\nOnly baby opossums hang from their tails. Adult opossums are too heavy to support themselves with just their tail, instead, they use it as a sort of fifth limb while climbing.\nPossum babies start off super small, but grow quickly and are mature and on their own by the time they are about 4 months old. Mother opossums often have more than one litter a season.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The family Didelphimorphia includes the opossum discussed in this article, but there are over 100 other species in family. Only the Virginia opossum, also known as the North American opossum or the common opossum, is found in North America. The remaining species are found throughout Mexico and Central and South America.\nAnother zoological family not closely related to Didelphimorphia is Phalangeridae, which includes about 70 species of small marsupials. This group is referred to as \"possums\" without the \"o\".\nNative to Australia and Indonesia, the old world \"possums\" include some very familiar little animals. The brushtail possum is the most wide-spread marsupial in mainland Australia, and is similar to the North American opossum in size. It also has a prehensile tail and spends a great deal of time in Eucalyptus trees where it feeds on leaves.\nThe beautiful little sugar glider belongs to the family Petauridae, another dozen or so little possums native to Australia, Indonesia, Tasmania and New Guinea. The sugar glider has a membrane of skin draped between the wrists and the ankles that act as a sort of parachute, allowing them to glide long distances between trees.\nThese animals have become popular pets as well, although one look at their massive eyes will tell you they are quite nocturnal, and that doesn't stop just because they are living in an apartment. Noisey nighttime activity, including lots of vocalizations is the number one negative of sugar gliders as pets, but if you don't mind a little action after midnight they can be very sweet and charming companions.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Grizzly Bear Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Grizzly-bear-facts.html", "text": "grizzly bear Facts\nPortrait of a Grizzly Bear\nThe grizzly bear is a subspecies of brown bear native to North West North America. Although all brown bears in the region are regularly referred to as grizzly bears, it is the subspecies \"arctos horribilis\" that is the true grizzly.\nGrizzly bears get their name from the \"grizzled\" appearance of their fur. Each hair is lighter at the tip than at the base and gives a variegated look. Grizzlies are also called \"silver-tips\" for this reason.\nWhile that is the meaning of the bears common name, its scientific name, \"horribilis\", refers to the supposed grisly (or horrible) nature of the animal.\nThere are numerous subspecies of brown bear which has the widest distribution of any of the eight bear species. They live in forested northern regions of North America, Europe and Asia, and can vary widely in size depending on regional availability of food, climate, and habitat.\nThe largest of the brown bears is the Alaskan Kodiak bear. These enormous creatures often top 1,600 pounds and are as big as polar bears. The Kodiak and the polar bear are the two largest land carnivores in the world.\nThe grizzly subspecies, also native to North America, averages 5% to 8% smaller than the Kodiak in size.\nThe smallest of the brown bear subspecies is the Eurasian bear, the largest population of which is in the mountains of Romania. Ancient historians report the brown bears of Europe to be largely carnivorous, regularly hunting both large and small game from reindeer to squirrels.\nThese are the same bears that were commonly used to fight in the Roman coliseum, pitted against each other, other exotic animals like lions and tigers, or even human gladiators in gruesome spectacles. As their habitat decreased, the Eurasian brown bear, and all brown bear subspecies adapted by eating more vegetation.\nOver time, the once razer sharp cutting teeth located further back in the jaw, transformed to more molar-type flattened teeth in order to grind grains and process nuts.\nMost brown bears today are omnivorous, digesting up to 85% vegetation. Fruits, berries, nuts, bark, roots and some flowers are eaten in massive quantities to power the bears enormous bulk, and the brown bear spends hours a day actively foraging for anything edible.\nRegionally, brown bears will eat various protein sources like salmon on the Alaskan coast, and elk in the interior forests, and in the summer months the grizzlies of Yellowstone park may obtain 30% of their daily calories by eating entire colonies of moths and ladybugs! - Grizzly Bear Facts\nthe grizzly bear club\nThe grizzly bear is a very large animal, often tipping the scales at well over 1300 pounds. Females are typically about 20% to 30% smaller than males, and both males and females will be considerably lighter in the spring, when they emerge from their 4 to 6 month long dormancy.\nGrizzly bears, like most bear species, live solitary lives except for the time they will spend growing up with their mother and siblings, and a few days a year in the summertime when they will pair off to mate.\nGrizzlies may have encounters with cougars, wolverines, wolves, black bears or coyotes, but these smaller animals will give way quickly, abandoning kills, dens and resting spots unless, in the case of a wolf or coyote pack, they have serious numbers on the grizzly, and even then, the risk is too great. A grizzly can kill a wolf or mountain lion with one swipe of its paw.\nThe big hump on the grizzlies back is a mass of muscle giving the brown bear the strongest front limbs of any animal in the world.\nWith no real natural enemies, the only conflict grizzlies have is among themselves. Males will compete with other males for territory and the right to mate with females by rising up on their hind legs and shoving each other.\nThey may swing at each other with their immense, paws, and can cause considerable damage. Occasionall,y grizzlies will kill each other in battle, and males will also regularly attempt to harm cubs that are not their own, causing injury or death to females.\nMother grizzlies spend a great deal of time avoiding solitary males, and must plan their activities around males territories and habits.\nWhen confronted however, a mother grizzly is fearless in defense of her cubs, and often her fierceness alone will drive an aggressive male away, as he realizes she will fight to the death, and probably cause harm to him in the process, after all she is 6 feet tall, and 400 pounds of actual angry mamma bear - and from whence the expression came. - Grizzly Bear Facts\nawesome grizzlies\ngrizzly bear reproduction\nleopard mothers and babies\nGrizzly bear mating and life cycle is similar to the polar bear in that there is an induced ovulation brought on by copulation, and then the eggs remain in a state of suspension until the female goes to den in the fall.\nOnce a male finds a receptive female, he may have to fight off other males to retain her company. Occasionally these battles are very violent, but usually they are more of a wrestling match to demonstrate strength and superiority.\nOnce paired up, a couple may stay together for a week or more, courting, playing and copulating often.\nInterestingly, the female does not begin ovulation until after the courtship begins, and it is these days of sexual activity that induce the ovulation.\nIn another very unique aspect of both grizzly bear and polar bear reproduction, the females fertilized eggs will actually remain in a state of suspension, not growing or developing for the first four full months of pregnancy. During these vital months, the female must eat as much as she can, and will usually double her body size, gorging on salmon and the young of animals like caribou and elk.\nShe may put on an additional 150 pounds of body weight before her babies even begin to grow!\nShe will need this mass for the most critical time in any grizzly bears life, because what she does next is truly astounding.\nSometime in the fall, the pregnant female will dig a huge den for herself, often using the base of a tree to burrow under. When she settles in, she will not venture out again for 4 to 6 months, not even to eat.\nShe does not hibernate, which would require a slowing of the heartbeat, but her metabolism does slow, and in the dark of the den some time in January or February she gives birth to her tiny cubs.\nTwins and triplets are typical, although up to four cubs are possible, and these babies are only about the size of a guinea pig. They nurse in the den until they reach about 20 pounds.\nExhausted and starving, the mother emerges from the den with her vulnerable troop in tow in late April or early May.\nThese first months out of the den are extremely dangerous times for cubs, and the biggest threat to them is from male grizzlies.\nThe female grizzly only mates every 3 to 4 years and so spends a long time with her cubs. Cubs usually spend a full four years with mom, before they leave her company.\nGrizzly bears and polar bears have a very slow reproductive rate, and the care and skill of the mother bear is extremely critical. Because the factor is so vital, the maternal instincts are extremely strong, and mother grizzlies shower their cubs with love and affection.\nThis bond, the sheer length of childhood, and the dedication of the mother grizzly may be why grizzlies are so intelligent. They have years of dedicated training, support and guidance that many other solitary carnivores don't enjoy. - Grizzly Bear Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Because the food is so plentiful, the bears are relatively cordial, and at some peak areas of these rivers, bears merely need to wait with jaws agape and a salmon will leap within range.\nThe high fat content of these delicious fish serve to revive the depleted grizzlies who have spent nearly 6 months in a suspended state.\nGrizzly bears and other bear species do not truly hibernate. True hibernation is a state where the heart rate drops and the body temperature plummets to where the body is not fully functioning. Because females give birth and maintain young in their dens, they cannot fully hibernate, and cannot loose body temperature.\nTrue hibernation is something reserved for smaller creatures animals and reptiles like garter snakes who are non-responsive when discovered hibernating, and whose core body temperatures are astonishingly low - sometimes down to 50 degrees.\nBears can be roused during dormancy, and females with newborns are intermittently fairly active in the den.\nAlong with salmon, grizzlies will hunt a variety pf prey including deer, caribou and even young moose. They will usually wait in ambush as opposed to stalking. They can be quick in the hunt, dashing out of hiding and knocking a hapless calf down with one mighty paw. The single blow will usually kill a young animal.\nGrizzlies don't use a kill bite on the head or throat like many other predators, but will kill by quickly disemboweling their prey.\nGrizzly bears have a tremendously varied diet, particularly when compared to the limits of bears like the panda, who eats bamboo almost exclusively, and the polar bear which consumes tremendous amounts of just two species of seal.\nAlong with salmon, various hoofed animals, and the natural staple of blueberries and blackberries,the grizzly bear will have a range that offers different roots and tubers, nuts, wild mushrooms, insects and grubs, and finally - if they happen upon one - honey bee hives.\nBears adore honey and their thick fur keeps them relatively protected as they shred open a hive and munch down the honey-comb. - Grizzly Bear Facts\nincredible hardware - grizzly bear claws and fangs\nThe grizzly bear has incredibly long, thick and powerful claws.\nThe nails themselves can be 5 to 6 inches long and thicker than a cigar. They use them to do more digging than any other bear species, uprooting shrubs, shredding logs and stumps in search of insects and tubers, and digging massive dens, sometimes in frozen ground, that must be large enough for them to maneuver in.\nThe fangs of an adult male grizzly bear are often close to 3 inches in length, but grizzly bears are more likely to do damage to an adversary or prey with a swat of their paw.\nPowered by the massive muscles in the grizzlies shoulder hump, one paw swipe from a grizzly can kill an animal as large as a moose. - Grizzly Bear Facts\na few more grizzly bear facts\nThe grizzly bear can eat about 100 pounds of food a day.\nGrizzly bears do not hibernate - they are in a dormant state but their body temperature does not drop dramatically as in true hibernation.\nGrizzly bears and polar bears occasionally inter-breed in the wild.

It is endemic to Galapagos. Colonies of the Galapagos sea lions are found on most gently-sloping rocky shores and beaches on the islands. There are about 50,000 sea lions in the islands.\nThe Galapagos sea lions diet is mainly fish. Their playful inquisitive nature, speed, agility on land and bark quickly make them an island favourite.\nThe males, known as \u2018Bulls\u2019 are the head of the colonies. They are larger than the females and can grow to measure 7 feet (2 metres) in length and weigh up to 800 pounds (363 kilograms). As the males grow larger, they begin to fight for dominance over territories including a \u2018Harem\u2019 which may contain between 5 and 25 female Sea Lions (Cows). Sea Lions are very territorial and will fight off any intruders that may enter their territory.\nEach female (cow) in a Harem gives birth to a single pup a year after mating.\nThe sea lion pups have a very strong bond with their mother.\nA single pup will be nurtured by its mother for up to 3 years following its birth.\nDuring the development of the bond, the cow and pup will learn to recongnise each others bark and be able to distinguish it from the rest of the colony. While the cow is nursing her pup, she will take it with her into the waters. When the pup is 2 \u2013 3 weeks old, the cow will mate again.\nWithin the Colony Sea Lion Pups live together in a \u2018Rookery\u2019 (like a nursery). Pups can be seen together napping, feeding and playing together. It is common to see one Cow caring for a group of Pups while the other cows go off into the waters to feed.\nGalapagos Sea Lions are especially vulnerable to human activity. Their inquisitive and social nature makes them more likely to approach areas inhabited by humans and to come in contact with human waste, fishing nets and hooks.\nSea Lions can be seen all over the islands. Snorkeling and kayaking with the playful pups is often the highlight of a visit to the Galapagos Islands.\nCheck out more of our Galapagos Marine Life posts!"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Facts About Lions For Kids | ALERT", "url": "https://lionalert.org/facts-about-lions-for-kids/", "text": "Despite looking very fierce, lions are actually classed as being \u2018vulnerable\u2019. This means that in the wild, they are in real danger of being wiped out. Only 40 years ago, Africa was home to 200,000 lions, now there are only around 32,000. That might still sound like a lot, but it means that in another 40 years, there may not be any alive at all. If every lion died, we would say that they had become extinct.\nThat is why we must try to look after those lions that are left. This is called conservation; the protection of animals in danger.\nThere are lots of different problems facing wild lions, including:\nLoss of habitat: A lion\u2019s habitat is the area in which it lives. As people destroy their land or build their own homes there, lions struggle to find somewhere else suitable to live.\nLoss of prey: These are the animals that a lion chooses to hunt and eat. Because lions have to share their food with humans, there is less to go round and they are forced to travel further and look harder to feed themselves and their families.\nConflict with people: When lions and humans live closely together, it can cause serious problems for each other. We call this conflict. People sometimes end up killing lions to protect their homes and farm animals.\nDisease and inbreeding: Animals can catch diseases, just like people, but wild lions can\u2019t get treatment to make them better. In areas where there aren\u2019t many lions, related family members sometimes have cubs together. This is called inbreeding and is a bad thing. It can cause health problems; making their young smaller, weaker and less likely to live very long.\nLions, like pet cats, can be very lazy creatures, spending around 20 hours a day resting. They are very sensitive to heat because they find it difficult to cool down. Because lions can\u2019t sweat as we do, the best way for them to cool down is by resting in the shade or on high rocks where they can catch a cool breeze.\nThey pant, just like a dog, or lay on their backs showing off the thinner skin and lighter fur on their bellies."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion Face: 5 Facts & 5 Images - AZ Animals", "url": "https://azanimal.easterndns.com/blog/lion-face-5-facts-5-images/", "text": "Big cats are some of the most effective, diverse, and widely dispersed predators throughout evolutionary history, so it makes sense that they\u2019d be a popular subject in art and culture. But there\u2019s something about the lion\u2019s features that inspire human creativity even more than cats like the jaguar and tiger. Part of that has to do with the lion\u2019s face. Its uniquely broad proportions and flowing mane have helped make the lion\u2019s face synonymous with royalty, justice, and power \u2014 but that unique facial design was also nurtured by natural selection to hone the lion into the king of the savanna.\nA lion\u2019s face can tell us a lot about how these lethal predators operate. Here are five fascinating facts that will offer greater context for why a lion\u2019s face is designed the way it is.\n#1: They Have the Loudest Roars But Middling Bite Strength For Cats\nLions can open their mouths nearly a foot. iStock.com/3dan3\nPart of the reason that cat species are such effective predators comes down to the shape of their jaws. Like other big cats, lions can open their jaws exceedingly wide \u2014 up to roughly a foot \u2014 allowing them to put an incredible amount of force into their bite. Lions will incapacitate their prey by locking their jaws and teeth around their throat and either snapping their necks or suffocating them to death depending on the strength of the prey animal. With larger and more durable animals like wildebeest, this painful process may take as many as thirty minutes. With a standard PSI of 650, a lion\u2019s bite force is significantly less than the spotted hyena \u2014 which is one of the lion\u2019s most prominent competitors and possesses a bite force of 1,100 PSI \u2014 and the jaguar \u2014 which is recognized as the cat with the most powerful bite force at 1,500 PSI.\nThis partly comes down to size. As the second-largest cat in the world, the African lion can often take its time because of how effectively it can pin down its prey. These highly specialized jaws and gruesome teeth mean that lions can\u2019t move their mouths side to side and grind pieces of food, so they instead use their sharp teeth to rip flesh into pieces and swallow it whole. That powerful jaw also helps project a powerful roar.\nWith a maximum volume of 114 decibels, they have the largest roar among any cat species and can project the noise to a distance of up to five miles. That\u2019s thanks to their flat, square vocal cords. This roar likely developed as a result of the lion\u2019s sociable tendencies. Roars can help pride members communicate with one another over long distances, but they can also be used as a form of intimidation between competing male rivals. Thanks to both their increased size and direct competition for breeding partners, male lions tend to have a more dramatic roar than lionesses.\n#2: The Mane is an Indicator of Status and Virility\nThe mane of a lion often indicates power. iStock.com/Beshoy Arian\nThe magnificent and wild mane of the lion has often been attributed to virility, power, and the right to rule over others in human culture \u2014 but recent studies indicate that this is more true and more complicated than we ever realized. Charles Darwin once suggested that male lions developed their manes to protect their neck and the back of their head from attacks by rivals, but many researchers have long expressed skepticism over this premise given that feuding lions tend to attack from behind and that neck and head bites are rarely a source of major or fatal injuries resulting from territorial or mating disputes. Despite that, the mane serves an important role in determining which lions are most likely to pass on their genetic materials and which tend to win in territorial disputes. But exactly why that happens is an object lesson in how roundabout the process of natural selection can be.\nThat\u2019s because longer and darker manes pose a liability to the survival of a lion. With no natural predators in the wild, the biggest threat to a lion is other members of its species and the dangers of their environment. Both a mane\u2019s size and its dark coloring can make a lion more susceptible to overheating and exhaustion and lions that live in open and hotter environments like deserts tend to grow more meager manes than lions in environments like forests with more shade and moderate climates. Longer manes are also associated with abnormal sperm and lower feeding rates.\nSince more magnificent manes offer distinct disadvantages while providing few if any practical benefits, reaching adulthood is a strong indicator of a lion\u2019s innate survivability. But both the coloring and length of a mane are directly proportional to a male lion\u2019s testosterone levels as well. Most male lions will begin to grow their mane at roughly a year old. Mane length typically correlates directly to a lion\u2019s success rates fighting other male lions, while the darkness of the mane seems to have a direct influence on attracting mates and successfully breeding. That\u2019s a critical advantage in a pride system where females usually have the leverage to choose their mates.\n#3: Their Whisker Patterns Are Each Unique\nThe whisker patterns on a lion\u2019s face are each unique. iStock.com/Pieter-Pieter\nFunctionally, a lion\u2019s whiskers work in the same way that your pet cat\u2018s whiskers do. Though they use the same follicles as normal fur, these hairs are significantly tougher, longer, and thicker. Functionally, they work in much the same way as an insect\u2018s antennae. The follicles that contain whiskers connect directly to the nervous system, and that allows for the processing of sensitive and surprisingly insightful sensory information from vibrations in the air.\nThough capable predators, cats generally don\u2019t have the best eyesight at short distances. So when interacting with objects close to them, vibrations often play a larger role in helping them navigate with their other senses. As primarily nocturnal hunters, lions also depend significantly on their whiskers for tracking prey and navigating their environment in the dark.\nWhiskers can also be used to identify a lion in the wild, at least as long as you can get close enough to a lion\u2019s face to properly inspect it. While all lions have four or five rows of black dots that serve as whisker holes, not all of them have whiskers inside of them \u2014 and the order and number in which they appear isn\u2019t consistent from one lion to another. A lion\u2019s whisker pattern is as unique as a human being\u2019s fingerprints, and conservationists are using these facts to help document the current struggle of this vulnerable and potentially endangered species. Tracking movement patterns and even population numbers of wild lions is difficult, but conservationists in Kenya have begun a diligent campaign of photographing lion whisker patterns and then comparing those photographs using a simple grid system to identify the habits of specific lions and better track their movements and numbers.\n#4: Their Noses Help Them Navigate Territory\nNavigating territory is an important function of a lion\u2019s nose. iStock.com/SKapl\nThe facts are that a lion shares more in common with the average house cat than just a set of whiskers on their face. They also share something known as the Jacobson\u2019s organ. If you\u2019ve ever seen your cat open its mouth into a sneer when prowling around the house, you\u2019re seeing a reaction known as the flehman response. By stimulating this sense receptor, lions can derive a surprisingly nuanced amount of information from little more than a whiff.\nWhile hunting, this enhanced sense of smell can be used to identify the presence of both predators and prey in an area along with roughly how long it\u2019s been since they were in the area. It\u2019s useful tactical information that can be used to evaluate the potential for prey in the area and help them head potential meals off at the pass. But it can also be used to dodge dangerous competitors like hyena packs and lead their pride to the kills of other predators.\nLions certainly aren\u2019t above scavenging prey from other hunter predators \u2014 particularly smaller wild felines like cheetahs and leopards that can\u2019t compete with the size of a lion or the numbers of an organized pride. As the only truly social cat breed, lions use smell to mark their territory and identify the territory of other individual lions and prides. Males will sometimes urinate to leave a message behind for potential competitors, but both males and females use more sensitive markers that can be picked up by their sensitive feline sense of smell. Scent glands can be found all around the head and face of a lion and are even located between their toes. By digging or rubbing their faces against surfaces, they can leave behind the oily substance that these glands produce and effectively mark their territory. A male\u2019s nose can even be used to detect when lionesses are in heat. \u200b\n#5: They See Best at Night\nThe eyes are one of the most important parts of a lion\u2019s face because lions are primarily nocturnal hunters. iStock.com/BreakingTheWalls\nWhile lions don\u2019t exclusively hunt at night, they\u2019re primarily nocturnal hunters. This makes sense given how hot it can get on the African savannah and how heavy a male\u2019s coat can be \u2014 but lions have also developed eyes that allow them to be better hunters at night. Thanks to their eyes having a smaller number of cones in them than humans, lions are only capable of seeing in colors that blend a combination of blue and green. But since they have a much higher ratio of rod cells, they have an incredible sense of night vision.\nA lion\u2019s night vision allows them to see between six and eight times better than humans in low light and darkness, and they\u2019ve even developed white streaks under their eyes that reduce glare and a secondary set of eyelids that sweep away dust and other debris when it builds up on the surface of the eye.\nLions don\u2019t necessarily have better night vision than the animals they hunt \u2014 as zebras, antelopes, and wildebeests have all developed rather effective methods of grazing at night. In an environment where dry heat can be the deadliest predator, the ability to operate nocturnally is often a practical necessity. Both females and males prefer to hunt at night, but it\u2019s arguably an advantage that male lions need more than their female counterparts. Females tend to hunt cooperatively using methods of corralling herds and cornering the weakest members, while males are more likely to hunt solo and thus rely on ambushing prey from vegetation that offers a shorter line of sight. This cover tends to be far more advantageous at night than it is during the day.\nOur research shows that five incredible facts about the lion\u2019s face are as follows:\nThey have the loudest roars but middling bite strength for cats.\nThe mane in an indicator of status and virility.\nTheir whisker patterns are each unique.\nTheir noses help them naviagte territory.\nThey see best at night.\nNext Up: Discover the Largest Whale Shark on Record"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "American lion - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lion", "text": "Extinct species of carnivore\nNot to be confused with the cougar , sometimes also referred to as \"American lion\".\nThe American lion (Panthera atrox), also known as the \"North American lion\", or \"American cave lion\", is an extinct pantherine cat that lived in North America during the Pleistocene epoch and the early Holocene epoch, about 340,000 to 11,000 years ago. Its fossils have been excavated from Alaska to Mexico. Genetic analysis has shown that the American lion and the Late Pleistocene Eurasian cave lion (Panthera spelaea) are sister lineages. It was about 25% larger than the modern lion, making it one of the largest known felids.\nHistory and taxonomy\nIllustration of the type specimen from Leidy, 1852\nInitial discovery and North American fossils\nThe first specimen now assigned to Panthera atrox was collected in the 1830s and placed in the collection of by William Henry Huntingtion Esquire, who announced their discovery to the American Philosophical Society on April 1, 1836 and placed with other fossils from Huntington's collection in the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. The specimen had been collected in ravines in Natchez, Mississippi and that were dated to the Pleistocene and the specimen consisted only of a partial left mandible with 3 molars and a partial canine. The fossils didn't get proper description until in 1853, Joseph Leidy named the fragmentary specimen (ANSP 12546), Felis atrox (\"savage cat\") Leidy named another species seen as synonymous with P. atrox in 1873, Felis imperialis (\"imperial cat\"), based on a mandible fragment from Pleistocene gravels in Livermore Valley, California.\nFew additional discoveries came until 1907, when the American Museum of Natural History and College, Alaska collected several Panthera atrox skulls in a locality originally found in 1803 by gold miners in Kotzebue, Alaska. The skulls were referred to a new subspecies of Felis (Panthera) atrox in 1930, Felis atrox \"alaskensis\". Despite this, the species didn\u2019t get a proper description and is now seen as a nomen nudum snynonymous with Panthera atrox. Further south in Rancho La Brea, California, a large Felid skull was excavated and later described in 1909 by John C. Merriam, who referred it to a new subspecies of Felis atrox, Felis atrox bebbi. The subspecies is synonymous with Panthera atrox.\nThroughout the early to mid 1900s, dozens of fossils of Panthera atrox were excavated at La Brea, including many postcranial elements and associated skeletons. The fossils were described by Merriam & Stock in detail in 1932, who synonymized many previously named taxa with Felis atrox. At least 80 individuals are known from La Brea Tar Pits and the fossils define the subspecies, giving a comprehensive view of the taxon. It wasn\u2019t until 1941 that George Simpson moved Felis atrox to Panthera, believing that it was a subspecies of jaguar. Simpson also referred several fossils from central Mexico, even as far south as Chiapas, as well as Nebraska and other regions of the western US to P. atrox. 1971 witnessed the description of fragmentary remains from Alberta, Canada that extended P. atrox\u2019s range north. In 2009, an entrapment site at Natural Trap Cave, Wyoming was briefly described and is the second most productive Panthera atrox-bearing fossil site. It most importantly contains well preserved mitochondrial DNA of many partial skeletons.\nPanthera onca mesembrina and possible South American material\nIn the 1890s in the \u201cCueva del Milodon\u201d in southern Chile, fossil collector Rodolfo Hauthal collected a fragmentary postcranial skeleton of a large Felid that he sent to Santiago Roth who described them as a new genus and species of Felid, \"Iemish listai\", in 1899, though the name is considered a nomen nudum. 5 years later in 1904, Roth reassessed the phylogenetic affinities of \u201cIemish\u201d and named it Felis listai and referred several cranial and fragmentary postcranial elements to the taxon. Notably, several mandibles, a partial skull, and pieces of skin were some of the specimens referred. 30 years later in 1934, Felis onca mesembrina was named by Angel Cabrera based on that partial skull from \u201cCueva del Milodon\u201d and the other material from the site was referred to it. Unfortunately, the skull (MLP 10-90) was lost, and was only illustrated by Cabrera. Further material, including feces and mandibles, was referred to as F. onca mesembrina from Tierra del Fuego, Argentina and southern other sites in Chile.\nIn 2016, the subspecies was referred to Panthera onca in a genetic study, which supported its identity as a subespecies of jaguar. Later in 2017, the subspecies was synonymized with Panthera atrox based on morphological similarities of all material, although these similarities are unreliable.\nEvolution\nThe American lion was initially considered a distinct species of Pantherinae, and designated as Panthera atrox , which means \"cruel\" or \"fearsome panther\" in Latin.[citation needed] Some paleontologists accepted this view, but others considered it to be a type of lion closely related to the modern lion (Panthera leo) and its extinct relative, the Eurasian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea or P. spelaea). It was later assigned as a subspecies of P. leo (P. leo atrox) rather than as a separate species. Most recently, both spelaea and atrox have been treated as full species.\nCladistic studies using morphological characteristics have been unable to resolve the phylogenetic position of the American lion. One study considered the American lion, along with the cave lion, to be most closely related to the tiger (Panthera tigris), citing a comparison of the skull; the braincase, in particular, appears to be especially similar to the braincase of a tiger. Another study suggested that the American lion and the Eurasian cave lion were successive offshoots of a lineage leading to a leopard-extant lion clade. A more recent study comparing the skull and jaw of the American lion with other pantherines concluded that it was not a lion but a distinct species. It was proposed that it arose from pantherines that migrated to North America during the mid-Pleistocene and gave rise to American lions and jaguars (Panthera onca). Another study grouped the American lion with P. leo and P. tigris, and ascribed morphological similarities to P. onca to convergent evolution, rather than phylogenetic affinity.\nMitochondrial DNA sequence data from fossil remains suggests that the American lion (P. atrox) represents a sister lineage to the Eurasian cave lion (P. spelaea), and likely arose when an early cave lion population became isolated south of the North American continental ice sheet about 340,000 years ago. The most recent common ancestor of the P. atrox lineage is estimated to have lived about 200,000 (118,000 to 346,000) years ago. This implies that it became genetically isolated from P. spelaea before the start of the Illinoian glaciation; a spelaea population is known to have been present in eastern Beringia by that time, where it persisted until at least 11,925 \u00b1 70 years ago. This separation was maintained during the interstadials of the Illinoian and following Wisconsin glaciations as well as during the Sangamonian interglacial between them. Boreal forests may have contributed to the separation during warmer intervals; alternatively, a reproductive barrier may have existed.\nThe study also indicates that the modern lion is the closest living relative of P. atrox and P. spelaea. The lineages leading to extant lions and atrox/spelaea were thought to have diverged about 1.9 million years ago, before a whole genome-wide sequence of lions from Africa and Asia by Marc de Manuel et al. showed that the lineage of the cave lion diverged from that of the modern lion around 392,000 \u2013 529,000 years ago.\nDescription\nReconstruction of an American lion\nThe American lion is estimated to have measured 1.6 to 2.5 m (5 ft 3 in to 8 ft 2 in) from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail and stood 1.2 m (3.9 ft) at the shoulder. Thus, it was a lot smaller than its contemporary competitor, the North American giant short-faced bear; and significantly smaller than the saber-toothed cat Smilodon populator, which exceeded 500 kg (1,100 lb) in weight (Smilodon populator is believed to be the largest and most powerful cat to have ever lived). In 2008, the American lion was estimated to weigh up to 420 kg (930 lb). A study in 2009 showed an average weight of 256 kg (564 lb) for males and 351 kg (774 lb) for the largest specimen analyzed. The body composition of Panthera atrox is 57.1 % skeletal muscle, 12.4 % bone, 11.8 % organs, 11.5 % skin and fur, 2.67 % adipose tissue and 4.62 % blood and waste.\nAbout 80 American lion individuals have been recovered from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, so their morphology is well known. Their features strongly resemble those of modern lions, but they were considerably larger, similar to P. spelaea and the Pleistocene Natodomeri lion of eastern Africa.\nPreserved skin remains found with skeletal material thought by its describers to be from the American lion in caves in the Argentine Patagonia indicate that the animal was reddish in color. Cave paintings from El Ceibo in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina seem to confirm this, and reduce the possibility of confusion with fossil jaguars, as similar cave paintings accurately depict the jaguar as yellow in color.\nDistribution\nThe earliest lions known in the Americas south of Alaska are from the Sangamonian Stage \u2013 the last interglacial period \u2013 following which, the American lion spread from Alberta to Maryland, reaching as far south as Chiapas, Mexico. It was generally not found in the same areas as the jaguar, which favored forests over open habitats. It was absent from eastern Canada and the northeastern United States, perhaps due to the presence of dense boreal forests in the region. The American lion was formerly believed to have colonized northwestern South America as part of the Great American Interchange. However, the fossil remains found in the tar pits of Talara, Peru actually belong to an unusually large jaguar. On the other hand, fossils of a large felid from late Pleistocene localities in southern Chile and Argentina traditionally identified as an extinct subspecies of jaguar, Panthera onca mesembrina, have been reported to be remains of the American lion.\nHabitat\nReconstruction of the American lion\nThe American lion inhabited savannas and grasslands like the modern lion. In some areas of their range, American lions lived under cold climatic conditions. They probably used caves for shelter from the cold weather in those areas,[note 1] and might have lined their dens with grass or leaves, as the modern Siberian tiger does.\nThe remains of American lions are not as abundant as those of other predators like Smilodon fatalis or dire wolves (Aenocyon dirus) at the La Brea Tar Pits, which suggests that they were better at evading entrapment, possibly due to greater intelligence. American lions likely preyed on deer, horses, camels, tapirs, American bison, mammoths, and other large ungulates (hoofed mammals). Evidence for predation of bison by American lions is particularly strong as a mummified carcass nicknamed \"Blue Babe\" was discovered in Alaska with clear bite and claw marks from lions. Based on the largely intact nature of the carcass, it probably froze before the lions could devour it. The American lion went extinct along with most of the Pleistocene megafauna during the Quaternary extinction event. The most recent fossil, from Edmonton, dates to 11,355 \u00b1 55 years ago. American lion bones have been found in the trash heaps of Paleolithic Native Americans, suggesting that human predation contributed to its extinction.\nA replica of the jaw of the first American lion specimen to be discovered can be seen in the hand of a statue of famous paleontologist Joseph Leidy, currently standing outside the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.\nSee also\nNotes\n^ This source confuses spelaea, which is the form found in Alaska and the Yukon, with atrox, the form known from Alberta southwards."}

Lionfish are noted for their venomous fin spines, which are capable of producing painful, though rarely fatal, puncture wounds. The fishes have enlarged pectoral fins and elongated dorsal fin spines, and each species bears a particular pattern of bold, zebralike stripes. When disturbed, the fish spread and display their fins and, if further pressed, will present and attack with the dorsal spines.\nOne of the best-known species is the red lionfish (Pterois volitans), an impressive fish sometimes kept by fish fanciers. It is striped with red, brown, and white and grows to about 30 cm (12 inches) long. The red lionfish is native to South Pacific reef ecosystems.\nIn the early 21st century the red lionfish became established in reef ecosystems along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Caribbean Sea. Its rapid rate of reproduction, combined with the absence of natural enemies in those regions, resulted in its decimation of local reef fishes and its designation as an invasive species. Wildlife managers suspect that lionfish were deliberately released by pet owners into the ocean along Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast starting in the 1980s, but damage to pet stores caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 may have also allowed others to escape.\nLearn how Indo-Pacific lionfish species have become invasive in ecosystems around the globe Learn how venomous lionfish species rapidly spread their geographic ranges in the early 21st century, disrupting the balance of ecosystems in the process.

Most animals are born at the start of the rainy season when food is plentiful and life is relatively easy. If you want to see baby animals on safari, this is the best time to go.\nHowever, there's more to these tiny creatures than their adorable appearance. Unlike human infants, wild babies have to adapt quickly to life in the bush. Prey animals like Wildebeest and Impala have to be able to run within a few hours of being born, and even predator cubs have to learn quickly how to avoid danger.\nBaby animals are heart-warmingly cute, and the offspring of Africa's safari animals are no exception. From elephant calves covered in ginger fuzz to playful lion and cheetah cubs, spotting baby animals is a highlight of any safari.\n01 of 07 Lion Cub Andy Rouse / Stone / Getty Images Lion cubs are usually born as part of a litter of up to four siblings. Female lions often synchronize births so that all of the pride's cubs are born around the same time. In this way, females can take turns caring for the cubs, which will suckle indiscriminately from any of the mothers as they get older. Lion cubs are blind for the first week but can crawl within a few days. They learn to walk at around 3 weeks old and are fully weaned by the age of 7 months. The first weeks are the most vulnerable, and during this time the mother lion hides her cubs in patches of long grass to avoid detection by other predators. As they become more stable, cubs play with each other, instinctively mimicking behaviors and strategies useful for hunting. The two biggest threats to lion cubs are starvation and infanticide. The latter happens when a new male takes over the pride and kills the offspring of his predecessor. The best places to see lion cubs in the wild include South Africa's Kruger National Park,\u200b Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.\n02 of 07 Elephant Calf Arno Meintjes Wildlife / Getty Images Elephant calves may be small compared to their parents, but they still weigh around 260 pounds (150 kilograms) at birth. Thanks to an incredible 22 month gestation period, baby elephants are well developed when they finally arrive and can walk within a few hours of being born. Baby elephants are unsure what to do with their trunks at first and will often suck on them in the same way that a human baby sucks their thumb. Elephants grow quickly, drinking around three gallons of milk every day. Their family unit is so strong that if a mother dies or is unable to care for her baby, the calf will be taken care of and nursed by a surrogate mother. Calves are usually weaned by the time they reach their first birthday, although they still depend on the herd for protection for at least another year after that. Female elephants stay with the herd for the rest of their lives, while males will eventually leave to form their own herd. Great places to see elephants in Africa include Botswana's Chobe National Park, South Africa's Addo Elephant Park, and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania.\n03 of 07 Gorilla Infant Fabian von Poser / Getty Images Like human babies, baby gorillas are called infants\u2014and with only around 880 mountain gorillas left in the world, it's a real privilege to see them in the wild. Gorillas are also similar to humans in that gestation takes around eight and a half months, and female gorillas have an average of three offspring during their lifetime. Twins do occur but are relatively rare. Newborns typically weigh in at around 4.5 pounds (2 kilograms)\u200b and are entirely dependent on their mothers until they learn to crawl at about 2 months old. Baby gorillas can walk by the time they're 9 months old, but are only truly independent of their parents at around 3 years old. For the first few months, baby gorillas ride on their mother's back, using their powerful fingers to grip tightly onto her long hair. Unlike most other African animals, mountain gorillas do not have a specific breeding season\u2014which means that if you join a gorilla trek in Rwanda, Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DMC), you stand a chance of seeing infants all year round.\n04 of 07 Cheetah Cub Tom Applegate / Getty Images Cheetahs are usually born in litters of three to five cubs. Cubs can weigh as little as 5.3 ounces (150 grams) at birth, although newborns are already capable of crawling and spitting. It takes up to 11 days for the cubs' eyes to open, and two weeks for them to start walking. In the wild, cheetah cubs are extremely vulnerable to predation by larger cats, so their mothers keep them well hidden for the first few weeks. They also have a mantle of long, bluish fur that disappears over time. It is thought that this acts as a deterrent to would-be predators, by helping the cubs resemble the fierce honey badger. Cheetah cubs are weaned by 6 months and start attempting to chase small animals around the same time. It usually takes over a year for juvenile cheetahs to make their first successful kill, however. In the meantime, they remain dependent on their mothers for meat. It's a rare treat to see baby cheetahs on safari, but your best bet is in the Serengeti, the Maasai Mara, and South Africa's Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.\nContinue to 5 of 7 below.\n05 of 07 Giraffe Calf Kenneth Canning / Getty Images Giraffe calves are usually born singly, or more rarely, as twins. Female giraffes give birth standing up\u2014so that the calf starts its life by falling several feet to the ground. Newborn giraffes are already over an astonishing six feet (2 meters) tall and are able to walk and even run within a few hours of being born. \u200bCo-ordination takes a little longer to achieve, however! The giraffe's small horns, or ossicones, are flattened in the womb to make birth easier, but become erect within a few days. These horns help the calf to regulate its body temperature, and if it's a male, it will one day be used in fights with other giraffes. Calves are typically weaned at around 18 months but will start to try vegetation as early as 2 months. Despite their impressive height, baby giraffes are a target for hungry lions. They depend on their mother's powerful kick for defense. Like gorillas, giraffes have no set breeding season. They are easily spotted at most private and national reserves in Southern and East Africa.\n06 of 07 Spotted Hyena Cub Arno Meintjes Wildlife / Getty Images Spotted hyena cubs are almost always born in pairs. They are well developed and are the largest of all carnivore offspring in relation to the weight of their mothers. Spotted hyena cubs are also unique in that they are born with their eyes open, and with sharp canine teeth that can measure up to a quarter-inch (7 millimeters) in length. It is common for hyena cubs to attack their siblings, and often the weaker will be killed. Despite their teeth, spotted hyena cubs suckle their mothers for up to 16 months, growing strong on milk that has the highest protein content of any terrestrial carnivore. Spotted hyenas are quick to develop, displaying territorial and even sexual behavior before they are even a month old. After just one year, they are already adept hunters and can start producing their own young at 3 years of age. Spotted hyenas are widespread throughout the top safari destinations of sub-Saharan Africa. Often, night safari drives offer the best sightings."}

This makes the water boatman the loudest animal relative to its body size.\n38. Monkey Business\nThe loudest land animal on land (not relative to anything) is the howler monkey who can be heard up to three miles away. They howl mostly to warn other monkeys that this is their territory and to let others within their own group know where they are.\n37. Trump\u2019s Favorite Monkey\nAlthough loud, howler monkeys are harmless and their way of dealing with humans they don\u2019t want near them is to innocently pee on them.\n36. A Wail of a Whale\nThe loudest mammals, period, are blue whales that can produce low-frequency pulses heard from more than 500 miles away.\n35. The Claw! The Claw!\nThe loudest known living creature (not a mammal) is the snapping shrimp, which has specialized claws that can shoot jets of superheated water up to 62 miles per hour and explode at 200 decibels to stun or even kill its prey.\n34. The Need for Speed\nA cheetah can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in three seconds, which is exactly the same as a Corvette. Except when you ride a cheetah, you don\u2019t look like a douchebag.\n33.

Team Effort\nThe Portuguese Man-O-War is actually not a single organism, but a collective of four organisms that work together to float, sting, eat, digest, and reproduce.\n26. Overkill\nThe 2-inch golden poison dart frog contains enough venom to kill 10 adult men. The frog eats flies, crickets, ants, and termites, so why so much poison?! Why? Nature is weird.\n25. The Shocker\nThe electric eel can deliver up to 600 volts of electricity, which is five times the power of a standard American wall socket, so it\u2019s just common sense not to stick your tongue in either.\n24. Don\u2019t Bother Running\nGrizzly bears can run at speeds up to 30 miles per hour. To compare, Usain Bolt was clocked at 27.8 mph during the 100 meter sprint. Long story short, if a bear wants you dead, you\u2019re dead.\n23. The Century Club\nGalapagos tortoises can live a long time, with average lifespans over a century.

Snakes ARE the Plane\nThe flying snake can glide in the air for distances up to 330 feet and can even make turns. Yeah. Because snakes weren\u2019t bad enough. Now they can fly? Screw you nature. Screw you.\n21. A Hardy Bunch\nScorpions are incredibly resilient, able to live on a single insect per year. Scientists have even frozen scorpions overnight, and once thawed, they walked away like nothing happened.\n20.

Just when you thought spiders couldn\u2019t get scarier.\n13. It\u2019s Complicated\nAfter mating, a male tarantula will run away from the female because if he sticks around, she\u2019ll eat him. God forbid if he doesn\u2019t at least drop a text later.\n12. Butt Out!\nAs a defense mechanism, sea cucumbers will eject their internal organs via their anus.\n11. Looking Down On Us\nAt 18 feet long, the king cobra is the largest venomous snake in the world and can raise itself up to 6 feet off the ground, enough to tower over most humans.\n10. Seal of Approval\nDuring breeding season, dominant male elephant seals can collect a harem of up to fifty females.\n9. Never Left the Party\nThe coelacanth is a prehistoric fish that was thought to have gone extinct 65 million years ago but was rediscovered in 1938. It is believed that they represent an early step in the evolution of fish to four-legged animals.\n8. Fat Head\nA coelacanth\u2019s brain occupies only 1.5% of its cranial cavity.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion - Feline Facts and Information", "url": "http://www.felineworlds.com/lion/", "text": "Lion\nFacts about Lions, Lion Anatomy, habitat, distribution, feeding, reproduction,\nevolution, social structure, conservation, Lion images and Lion Videos\nLion Facts and Information\nThe Lion is said to be the king of the jungle. The Tiger is the largest feline and the Lion is second. It is also one that is very distinguished. With their wild manes that get larger as they get older they are easily identifiable. Of course the mane is only on the males.\nThe Lion is a very social animal and that is a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other felines. They will live together and they will hunt together. One adult male is the leader. The rest are females and the young cubs that make up the pride. When the young males are old enough to start mating they will be forced out of the group. Then they will go and form their own pride in their own territory.\nThe female lions take care of almost all of the hunting. This is why it can be very difficult for a male to go out on his own. He may have to take on challenging another male in order to take over a pride that already exists. By doing so he does much more than assume a leadership role. He is also securing his own survival because it can be very hard for a male Lion to do all of his own hunting.\nThere are many different types of food that the Lion will consume. They are skilled hunters with a strategy in place that can\u2019t be beat. They will ambush their prey from all directions and close in for the kill. They will also eat the remains of other kills that may have been left behind from various animals.\nThere have been instances of the Lion attacking and consuming humans that they come into contact with. Some experts believe that it is possible for a Lion to get a desire for human meat after doing so. That can make such felines very dangerous when there are villages around where they reside.\nTop Lion Facts The Lion is the second largest feline \u2013 only the Tiger is bigger.\nThe largest known Lion weighed 826 pounds More Facts about Lions\u2026\nThe Lion isn\u2019t active very much at all, with resting consuming up to 20 hours a day. They spend the rest of their time eating, walking, grooming, and socializing. They rest more than any other type of feline. Each member of the Lion pride has a role that is very important. Some of them are hunters and others are caregivers. Some of them work to protect the entire pride and there are those that scout out the environment watching for predators.\nThey are very social animals and often seen being affectionate with each other. They use many vocalizations to communicate with each other. The one that is most commonly associated with them is the ferocious roar. They also growl, purr, and mew at each other. The intensity of such sounds can indicate fear, anger, offer warnings, and even offer encouragement for mating.\nThere aren\u2019t very many Lions left living in the wild. Studies show that their populations have declined as much as 50% in the past 20 years. Is their reign as king of the jungle going to come to an end? Right now they are classified as being vulnerable. Only time will tell if they are going to be able to continue surviving. A lack of natural habitat, a genetic pool that is very close to each other, and slow rates of reproduction are all issues that conservation groups continue to focus on."}

Let us know in the comments section at the bottom of the page!\nJungle Animals From Africa\nBongo\nScientific Name: Tragelaphus eurycerus\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Even-Toed Ungulate\nConservation Status: Near Threatened\nThe bongo is a large forest antelope that lives in the tropical jungles of Central Africa. One of the world\u2019s most distinctive antelopes, the bongo has a bright, chestnut-brown coat with vertical white stripes. With a shoulder height of up to 1.3 m / 4.3 ft, the bongo is the world\u2019s third-largest antelope.\nLarge ears provide the bongo with excellent hearing. Its pointed, spiral horns can grow up to a meter (3.28 ft.) in length. Both males and females have horns.\nThe bongo is herbivorous and mainly active at night\nBonobo\nScientific Name: Pan paniscus\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Primate\nWhere Found: Africa\nConservation Status: Endangered\nThe bonobo is a primate that lives in the jungles of the Congo Basin in Africa. It lives in groups of between 30 and 80 individuals. An omnivore, the bonobo will supplement its largely fruit and seed-based diet with insects and small mammals such as rodents.\nBonobos, along with the closely-related chimpanzee, are our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom. Bonobos are highly-intelligent, and captive individuals have been taught to understand around 3,000 words.\nYou can find out more about bonobos on this page: Bonobo Facts\nYou can find out more about primates on this page: Primate Facts\nChimpanzee\nScientific Name: Pan troglodytes\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Primate\nConservation Status: Endangered\nThe chimpanzee lives in the jungles of Central and Western Africa. It is slightly larger than the closely-related bonobo. A large male chimp stands around 150 cm (4 ft 11 in) tall.\nChimpanzees are highly intelligent and often use objects such as sticks and stones as tools. Sadly, The species is threatened by habitat loss and is endangered.\nYou can find out more about chimpanzees on this page: Chimpanzee Facts\nYou can find out more about primates on this page: Primate Facts\nDwarf Crocodile\nScientific Name: Osteolaemus tetraspis\nFamily: Crocodylidae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nGrowing to around 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length, the dwarf crocodile is the world\u2019s smallest living crocodile. (It\u2019s not the smallest Crocodilian, however; that\u2019s the dwarf caiman, a South American species.)\nThe dwarf crocodile is found in the tropical jungles of West and Central Africa. It spends less time basking in the sun than other crocodiles, and is mostly nocturnal. The dwarf crocodile also spends less time in the water than other crocs and will forage for food on land, as well as in the water.\nYou can find out more about African crocodiles on this page: African Crocodiles\nForest Elephant\nScientific Name: Loxodonta cyclotis\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Elephantidae\nConservation Status: Critically Endangered\nThe forest elephant (also known as the African forest elephant) is one of two elephant species found in Africa: the other is the larger African bush elephant. Until recently, both African elephants were considered to be the same species.\nThe forest elephant is the smallest of the three species of elephant. (The third elephant species, the Asian elephant, is found in Asia.)\nThe forest elephant is found in the jungles of West and Central Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The species is critically endangered. It is threatened by habitat loss, poaching for its ivory, and being hunted for food.\nYou can find out more about elephants on this page: Elephant Facts\nGorilla\nGenus: Gorilla\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Primate\nFamily: Hominidae\nConservation Status: Critically Endangered\nGorillas are the largest non-human primates, and are among our closest relatives in the animal kingdom (only the chimpanzee and bonobo are more closely related to humans).\nThere are two species of gorilla: the western gorilla and the eastern gorilla. Both can be found in jungles and in a range of other forest habitats. A subspecies of the eastern gorilla, the mountain gorilla, is found in mountain forests of Central Africa.\nGorillas live in groups led by a large adult male known as a silverback. Gorillas are mainly herbivorous, with leaves and shoots making up the majority of their diet.\nYou can find out more about gorillas on this page: Gorilla Facts\nYou can find out more about western gorillas on this page: Western Gorilla Facts\nYou can find out more about primates on this page: Primate Facts\nLeopard\nScientific Name: Panthera pardus\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Felidae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nWith its spotted coat, sleek yet powerful body, and ringed tail, the leopard is one of the world\u2019s most recognizable animals.\nThe leopard is able to survive in many different habitats, ranging from rainforests to grasslands.\nDespite being found over a vast area \u2013 the leopard is present in much of Sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia \u2013 the big cat\u2019s population is decreasing. As with so many other jungle animals, deforestation is a major factor in the leopard\u2019s decline.\nThe leopard is a powerful predator, able to drag its prey up trees; a useful ability for an animal that shares its range with lions that would happily steal the food for themselves.\nYou can find out more about leopards on this page: Leopard Facts\nYou can find out more about big cats on this page: What Is A Big Cat?\nYou can find out more about cats on this page: Cat Facts\nYou can see a list of every member of the cat family on this page: Wild Cats List with Pictures And Facts\nPygmy Hippopotamus\nScientific Name: Choeropsis liberiensis\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Even-Toad Ungulate\nFamily: Hippopotamidae\nConservation Status: Endangered\nThe pygmy hippopotamus, and its larger cousin, the hippopotamus, are the only two living members of the family Hippopotamidae; all of the other known species are extinct. With a decreasing wild population thought to number under 2,500 adult individuals, the pygmy hippo may be following in the footsteps of its extinct relatives.\nLike the hippopotamus, the pygmy hippopotamus is a semi-aquatic, herbivorous animal that spends much of its life in the water. The pygmy hippo is solitary and nocturnal, and rarely seen by humans.\nYou can find out more about pygmy hippopotamuses on this page: Pygmy Hippo Facts\nTree Pangolin\nScientific Name: Phataginus tricuspis\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Manidae\nConservation Status: Endangered\nAlso known as the white-bellied pangolin, the tree pangolin is one of eight species of pangolin. Its body is covered with large scales, and it can walk either on all four legs, or just its hind legs. If feeds mainly on ants and termites\nThe tree pangolin is nocturnal, and spends much of its time in trees. It is found in dense forests, often near rivers, in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nJungle Animals From Asia\nCrested Serpent Eagle\nScientific Name: Spilornis cheela\nType Of Animal: Bird, Family: Accipitridae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe crested serpent eagle is a jungle predator known for preying on snakes and lizards. It flies over areas of thick vegetation in search of a good hunting spot, then sits and waits for its prey to approach. It will occasionally pursue its prey on foot.\nDhole\nScientific Name: Cuon alpinus\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Canidae (the dog family)\nConservation Status: Endangered\nThe dhole is an endangered wild dog that lives in the jungles of Central and Southern Asia. It lives in the same regions as tigers and leopards, and hunts for similar types of prey. However, it\u2019s not competition with these fearsome cats that has caused the dhole to become endangered; it\u2019s competition with man.\nOverhunting of the dhole\u2019s main prey \u2013 animals such as deer \u2013 by humans means that there\u2019s little left for the dhole. This, together with habitat loss caused by human expansion, has left the dhole with less food, and a smaller area in which to hunt.\nDholes live and hunt in packs of around 12 individuals and communicate using whistles, whines, screams, and a number of other vocalizations.\nYou can find out more about dholes on this page: Dhole Facts\nYou can see a list of every wild dog species on this page: Wild Dogs List with Pictures & Facts\nGaur\nScientific Name: Bos gaurus\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Bovidae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe gaur is the largest member of the family Bovidae. With a maximum weight of around 1.5 metric tonnes, this Asian species is heavier than both the European and American bison. The gaur is also known as the Indian bison.\nThe gaur is a herbivorous bovid that is usually active during the day. Where found living near humans, the gaur can develop a nocturnal activity pattern. It lives alone or in small herds for much of the year, but may congregate in larger herds at certain times of the year.\nGreat Hornbill\nScientific Name: Buceros bicornis\nType Of Animal: Bird\nFamily: Bucerotidae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe great hornbill is named after its long, horn-shaped bill. It is one of the largest of the fifty-or-so members of the hornbill family, Bucerotidae.\nHornbills are found in Asia and Africa. These fruit-eating birds are similar in appearance and behavior to the toucans of the Americas. This is an example of convergent evolution \u2013 the process by which unrelated species develop similar adaptations.\nThe great hornbill\u2019s vulnerable status is mainly caused by deforestation.\nRed Junglefowl\nScientific Name: Gallus gallus\nType Of Animal: Bird\nFamily: Phasianidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe red junglefowl is a bird found in the jungles of southern Asia. If it seems familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the main ancestors of the domestic chicken. Don\u2019t be surprised to hear the familiar sound of a cock crowing even if you\u2019re deep in the jungle.\nThe red junglefowl usually flies only to reach a tree branch to roost upon or to evade a predator. It spends most of its time foraging for seeds on the jungle floor.\nReticulated Python\nScientific Name: Malayopython reticulatus\nType Of Animal: Reptile\nFamily: Pythonidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe reticulated python is famous for being the world\u2019s longest snake, and is also one of the three heaviest. It can reach lengths of over 6 meters / 19.7 ft. The species gets its name from its net-like scale pattern (\u2018reticulated\u2019 means \u2018net-like\u2019).\nThis large jungle snake is often found near water and is an excellent swimmer. The species has even been found swimming far out at sea.\nThe reticulated python, like all other pythons, is non-venomous. It is an ambush predator that overcomes its prey by constriction.\nYou can find out more about the reticulated python on this page: Reticulated Python Facts\nSumatran Rhinoceros\nScientific Name: Dicerorhinus sumatrensis\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Rhinocerotidae\nConservation Status: Critically Endangered\nWith a total adult population thought to be in the region of just 30 individuals, the Sumatran rhinoceros is one of the rarest jungle animals in the world. The near-extinction of this large herbivore is the result of centuries of overhunting and habitat loss.\nThe Sumatran rhino is the smallest rhino species, but can still reach a length of over 3 meters / 10 ft. and a weight of up to a metric tonne / 2,200 lb. Despite its large size, the Sumatran rhino is rarely seen. It is a shy, solitary animal that wanders over a large home range.\nYou can find out more about rhinos on this page: Rhino Facts\nSun Bear\nScientific Name: Helarctos malayanus\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Ursidae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe sun bear is found in the jungles of Southeast Asia, and is present in India, Thailand, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries.\nOf the eight living species of bear, the sun bear is the most arboreal (tree-dwelling), spending much of its life in the trees. An omnivore, the sun bear\u2019s diet includes termites, ants, insect larvae, honey and fruit.\nThe sun bear gets its name from the distinctive yellow-orange patch on its chest.\nYou can find out more about bears on this page: Bears: The Ultimate Guide\nYou can find out more about sun bears on this page: Sun Bear Facts\nTiger\nScientific Name: Panthera tigris\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Felidae\nConservation Status: Endangered\nThe tiger is the largest member of the cat family, Felidae. This solitary hunter is an apex predator, with no natural predators of its own.\nAs well as being found in tropical jungles, the tiger can live in grasslands, and even taiga forests that are covered with snow for much of the year.\nWith its orange coat and black stripes, the tiger is one of the world\u2019s most recognizable animals. Despite its familiarity, the tiger is in trouble. With under 3,500 adults left in the wild, this fearsome animal is fighting for survival.\nYou can find out more about tigers on this page: Tiger Facts\nYou can find out more about big cats on this page: What Is A Big Cat?\nYou can find out more about cats on this page: Cat Facts\nYou can see a list of every member of the cat family on this page: Wild Cats List with Pictures And Facts\nWater Monitor\nScientific Name: Varanus salvator\nType Of Animal: Reptile\nFamily: Varanidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe water monitor is a large lizard that belongs to the genus Varanus \u2013 a group of around 80 reptiles known as \u201cmonitor lizards\u201d. The water monitor is large, even for a monitor lizard, and can reach lengths of over 2 meters / 6.5 ft.\nAs its name suggests, the water monitor has a semi-aquatic lifestyle. A carnivore, its diet includes water animals such as fish, frogs and snakes. Armed with sharp teeth and claws, the water monitor is even known to prey on small crocodiles.\nAs well as living in mangrove forests, this adaptable reptile is also found in swamps, shrubland, and even in towns and cities.\nThe water monitor is also known as the Asian water monitor and the common water monitor. In Thailand, its name is used as an insult.\nJungle Animals From Australia\nBowerbird\nScientific Name: Family Ptilonorhynchidae\nType Of Animal: Bird\nMany of the ninety species of bowerbird are brightly-colored, but that\u2019s not what makes these birds special. Instead, it\u2019s the ability of male bowerbirds to construct elaborate stick buildings known as \u201cbowers\u201d that sets them apart from other jungle birds.\nOnce the male has built his bower, he decorates it with brightly-colored objects collected from the surrounding jungle. If a visiting female is sufficiently impressed, she will mate with the male. The only purpose of the bower is to attract females; the eggs are laid in a separate nest.\nBowerbirds are found in the jungles of New Guinea and Australia.\nMusky Rat-Kangaroo\nScientific Name: Hypsiprymnodon moschatus\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Marsupial\nFamily: Hypsiprymnodontidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe musky rat-kangaroo is a small marsupial found in the rainforests of northeast Australia. A solitary animal, the musky rat-kangaroo is active during the day and spends the night in a nest. It eats fruit, fungi and insects.\nSouthern Cassowary\nScientific Name: Casuarius casuarius\nType Of Animal: Bird, Ratite\nFamily: Casuariidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe southern cassowary is one of three species of cassowary and the only one found in Australia. The fourth member of the family Casuariidae is the emu, another large flightless bird.\nThe southern cassowary reaches a height of up to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) and is the world\u2019s third-tallest bird after the two species of ostrich.\nThe horn-like helmet on top of a cassowary\u2019s head is called a casque. The exact function of the casque is unknown \u2013 it may be an indicator of a bird\u2019s health to potential mates, or may serve to amplify the cassowary\u2019s call.\nYou can find out more about cassowaries on this page: Cassowary Facts\nTiger Quoll\nScientific Name: Dasyurus maculatus\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Marsupial\nFamily: Dasyuridae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe tiger quoll is also known as the \u201cspotted-tailed quoll\u201d on behalf of the distinctive markings on its tail. It is the largest of the six species of quoll, and the second-largest carnivorous marsupial, after the Tasmanian Devil. The species has an extremely powerful bite for its size, and hunts a range of small to medium-sized animals including lizards, birds and rabbits.\nThe tiger quoll is found in thick forests and other habitats in eastern Australia.\nYou can find out more about quolls on this page: Quoll Facts\nJungle Animals From Central and South America\nBaird\u2019s Tapir\nScientific Name: Tapirus bairdii\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Odd-toed ungulate\nFamily: Tapiridae\nConservation Status: Endangered\nBaird\u2019s tapir is the largest land mammal in South America, reaching a maximum length of around 2.5 m (8.2 ft), and weight of around 400 kg (880 lb.). It is a solitary, nocturnal creature with few natural predators due to its size and aggression.\nYou can find out more about tapirs on this page: Tapir Facts\nBull Shark\nScientific Name: Carcharhinus leucas\nType Of Animal: Fish, Family: Carcharhinidae (requiem shark)\nConservation Status: Near Threatened\nThe jungle is full of dangerous animals, and don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be any safer in the water! The bull shark is a coastal species that can also be found in brackish estuaries and even in rivers hundreds of miles upstream from the coast.\nBecause they are found in shallow coastal waters and freshwater habitats, Bull sharks are thought to be responsible for more attacks on humans than any other species of shark.\nA large adult female bull shark (females are slightly bigger than males) can reach 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length and 130 kg (290 lb.) in weight.\nYou can find out more about sharks on this page: Shark Facts\nFer-De-Lance / Bothrops asper\nScientific Name: Bothrops asper\nType Of Animal: Reptile\nFamily: Viperidae\nConservation Status: Unassessed\nIf you\u2019re exploring the jungle in Central or South America, watch out for snakes of genus Bothrops, several of which are known as Fer-De-Lances (the name is French for \u201cspearhead\u201d).\nSnakes of genus Bothrops are responsible for more fatal snake bites in the Americas than any other snake group. Bothrops asper is found from southern Mexico to northern South America. Look out for its flat, spearhead-like head and triangular skin patterns.\nYou can find out more about snakes on this page: Snake Facts\nJaguar\nScientific Name: Panthera onca\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Felidae\nConservation Status: Near Threatened\nThe jaguar is one of the most powerful jungle predators. This fearsome felid is found in the jungles of Central and South America, and occasionally even ventures into the southern United States.\nThe third-largest of the big cats of genus Panthera, the jaguar is quite capable of taking prey as large and formidable as caimans and tapirs.\nYou can find out more about the jaguar on this page: Jaguar Facts\nYou can find out more about big cats on this page: What Is A Big Cat?\nYou can find out more about cats on this page: Cat Facts\nYou can see a list of every member of the cat family on this page: Wild Cats List with Pictures And Facts\nKeel-Billed Toucan\nScientific Name: Ramphastos sulfuratus\nType Of Animal: Bird\nFamily: Ramphastidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nOne of the most characterful jungle birds is the keel-billed toucan. Like all toucans, the keel-billed toucan has a large curved bill with which it forages for food in the rainforest canopy.\nDespite looking like a formidable weapon, a toucan\u2019s bill is largely hollow and relatively lightweight. As well as being a useful tool for reaching fruit, the bill is also thought to help the toucan keep its body at the correct temperature.\nDespite looking friendly, toucans have a darker side; they regularly steal eggs and nestlings from the nests of other birds.\nYou can find out more about toucans on this page: Toucan Facts\nMantled Howler Monkey\nScientific Name: Alouatta palliata\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Primate\nFamily: Atelidae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe world\u2019s jungles are home to many primates: early primates evolved to live in trees, and today\u2019s monkeys and apes have many adaptations for this environment, including good eyesight, flexible shoulders and gripping hands.\nThe mantled howler monkey is just one of many monkeys that live in jungles. This large monkey is found in the forests of Central America. It mainly eats leaves, and lives in large groups of up to 40 individuals.\nLike other howler monkeys, the mantled howler is known for its extremely loud territorial howls. Howler monkeys howl in order to alert other troops of their presence. This \u201cshouting battle\u201d prevents real, physical battles from taking place.\nYou can find out more about howler monkeys on this page: Howler Monkey Facts\nOscar\nScientific Name: Astronotus ocellatus\nType Of Animal: Fish\nFamily: Cichlidae\nConservation Status: Unassessed\nThe Oscar is a freshwater fish found in shallow rivers and streams in the Amazon Basin. The eye-like markings on its tail are thought to deter attacks from piranhas.\nOscars are kept as pets in aquariums in many parts of the world. They are also caught and sold for food in South America.\nPanamanian Night Monkey\nScientific Name: Aotus zonalis\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Primate\nFamily: Aotidae\nConservation Status: Near Threatened\nThe Panamanian night monkey belongs to the genus Aotus, members of which are also known as \u201cnight monkeys\u201d. The eleven species of night monkey are the only truly nocturnal monkeys.\nMost, possibly all, Panamanian night monkeys are found in Panama and Columbia. The species has brown fur and a relatively short tail. Like all night monkeys, it has large eyes to help it see at night.\nRed-Bellied Piranha\nScientific Name: Pygocentrus nattereri\nType Of Animal: Fish\nFamily: Serrasalmidae\nConservation Status: Unassessed\nThe red-bellied piranha is a freshwater fish found in the Amazon basin and several other river systems in South America. The species is named for the red color of its undersides. It is the largest species of piranha.\nPiranhas have sharp teeth and powerful jaws. Despite their fearsome reputation, piranhas rarely attack humans. They are primarily scavengers, and are often preyed on by other animals.\nYou can find out more about piranhas on this page: Piranha Facts\nSpectacled Owl\nScientific Name: Pulsatrix perspicillata\nType Of Animal: Bird\nFamily: Strigidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe spectacled owl is a nocturnal predatory bird in the family Strigidae. It is named after the spectacle-like white markings around its yellow eyes.\nAlthough the conservation status of the spectacled owl is Least Concern, its population is thought to be decreasing.\nJungle Animals List: Conclusion\nThe animals in the list above are just a small selection of the many thousands of animals that live in jungles.\nYou can discover more amazing animals on the following pages:"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Mountain Lion Cougar, Panther or Puma - DesertUSA", "url": "https://www.desertusa.com/animals/mountain-lion.html", "text": "Powerful, graceful and supremely adaptable, the mountain lion - or, cougar, panther, puma, catamount or painter - laid claim to a range that encompassed most of the New World, from the snowy fields of the Yukon to the forested coastal mountains of Tierra del Fuego and from the shores of the Pacific Ocean to the shores of the Atlantic. It occupied more territory and more environmental niches than any other land mammal (other than the Homo sapien) in the Western Hemisphere.\nAppearance and Anatomy of Mountain Lions\nShape: similar to short-haired house cat, with a relatively small head, shortened face, small and rounded ears, elongated body, and long neck and tail\nTypical Length: males, about eight to as much as nine feet from the nose to the tip of its tail, and females, about six to seven feet\nTypical Shoulder Height: two to two and one-half feet\nUsual Weight: males, 125 to 160 pounds, and females, 80 to 100 pounds\nColor: Tawny to rufous to buff to bluish gray along the back and sides with lighter colored belly, throat and inner legs and with a black-bracketed nose and a dark-tipped tail\nHunting Attributes: powerful legs suited for rapid acceleration and pouncing and teeth designed for seizing, slashing and tearing\nModern Distribution, Range and Habitat\nRemarkably, in spite of relentless human intrusion, the mountain lion has retained much of its original distribution throughout the New World, although by 1900, it had been hunted almost into extinction in the eastern United States. A century later, it had begun to return to the eastern states, drawn primarily by the burgeoning white-tailed deer population.\nThe mountain lion - a solitary, nocturnal animal - may stake out a range of several dozen square miles, with the size of its area defined largely by the abundance of prey. Typically, the male, declaring his ownership by scents, refuses to share his range with other males. A female may share her range with other females, and she selects a range based, not only on the basis of prey availability, but also on proximity to male ranges and opportunities for mating. The mountain lion tends to use a core area for birthing and resting and an extended area for hunting.\nThe mountain lion may select a range located anywhere from the shore of the sea up to the higher elevations of mountain slopes, reaching up to elevations up to 11,000 feet in California and as high as 15,000 feet in Ecuador, according to Walker's Mammals of the World. It may migrate up into the higher elevations in the summer and down into lower elevations in winter.\nExcept for females with kittens, the mountain lion shelters, not in a fixed den, but rather in crevices, caves and dense brush. According to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife Internet site, they have been found living in populated areas, in drainage ditches and culverts.\nThe mountain lion is so adaptable that it may thrive, said the Our Lands and Their Creatures Internet site, in habitats varying from \"lowland tropical forests, swamps, and grassland, to mountain conifer forests, desert scrub, and any location with adequate cover and prey.\" As a stalk-and-ambush predator, the mountain lion, according to the U. S. Department of Agriculture Internet site, prefers densely forested areas in coastal swamps such as those of southern Florida, and it tends to choose vegetated ridges, rocky cliffs and ledges, and other solid covers in inland areas such as those of the Southwest desert basin and mountain range country.\nHunting Habits, Diet and Predator Foes\nThe mountain lion hunts by stalking and ambushing, often pouncing on its prey from an elevated vantage point or running it down with a burst of speed. If possible, it attacks the back of its prey, crushing the neck with its teeth. It uses its large front paws and heavy claws to clutch its prey. Usually, according to the U. S. Department of Agriculture paper, \"Managing Mountain Lion Problems,\" the mountain lion removes its prey's viscera and eats the heart, liver and lungs first.\nIn the United States, the mountain lion often favors white tail and mule deer, but it will prey on any animal it can catch, including anything from elk, moose and bighorn sheep to rodents, reptiles and birds. Some even eat insects.\nTypically, the mountain lion caches its larger kills, secreting them in secluded spots and covering them with leaves and branches. It returns to feed from its kill for several days. On average, it may kill a larger animal once a week. A female with kittens to feed may kill more frequently. An adult mountain lion eats 8 to 10 pounds of meat a day, according to a fact sheet prepared by T. R. Mader, Research Director, Abundant Wildlife Society of North America.\nMature, healthy mountain lions run little risk of predation (other than by human hunters), but the young or sick may be attacked by wolf packs, bears or even other mountain lions.\nLife Cycle\nThe male mountain lion reaches sexual maturity at about three years of age, the female, at about two and a half years of age, according to Walker's Mammals of the World. The mountain lion has no specific breeding season, but in the United States, it often mates in the late fall or early winter. The male returns to his solitary ways. The female gives birth to one to six - commonly three or four - spotted, blind kittens about three months later, typically in a den located in a dense thicket or beneath a fallen log.\nShe nurses her brood for about three months, introducing the kittens to meat after their first month and a half. She teaches them to hunt when they reach about six months of age, when they take on their adult colors. She may tutor them in the art of the kill for perhaps another year, when they will leave her side to face the hazards of establishing their own territories. She will take her rest from rearing mountain lions for perhaps a year. With luck, a mountain lion may live in the wild for 8 to 10 years. It might live in captivity for 20 years.\nTaxonomy of the Mountain Lion\nKingdom -- Animalia -- All animals\nPhylum -- Chordata -- Mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish\nClass -- Mammalia -- Vertebrate, milk-producing animals with hair\nOrder -- Carnivora -- Cats, canines, bears, badgers, weasels, skunks and others\nFamily -- Felidae -- Mountain lions, jaguarundis, bobcats, Canadian lynx, jaguars, tigers, lions, margays, ocelots, leopards, cheetahs and domestic cats\nGenus -- Puma -- Mountain lion, jaguarundis\nSpecies -- Puma concolor -- Mountain Lion\nA Few Mountain Lion Facts\nExceptionally agile, the mountain lion can leap more than 18 feet in height and more than 20 feet in length. It can drop more than 50 feet from a vantage point onto prey without suffering injury. - Geocities Internet site\nThe mountain lion can run approximately 35 miles for hour for short distances.\nThe Mountain Lion uses its long, heavy tail like a rudder when turning sharply to catch prey such as deer. - San Francisco State University Internet site\nThe mountain lion holds the Guinness record for the animals with the highest number of names. In the English language the mountain lion has more than 40 names.\nUnlike the tiger or the African lion, the mountain lion cannot roar because of the structure of its larynx, or voice box. Instead, it produces a high-pitched scream, earning it a place in American folklore. - San Francisco State University Internet site\nCommon Questions About Mountain Lions\nDo mountain lions attack people?\nDo mountain lions attack livestock and pets?\nHow can I protect my family as well as my livestock and pets from mountain lion attacks?\nMountain Lion Basics\n3 Mountain Lions on trail next to a creek\n--Source/writer: Jay Sharp"}

They also scavenge, oreat animals that they themselves haven\u2019t killed.\nReproduction: Breeding occurs at any time of the year and a pair of lions can mate up to 40 times in a day. In any one pride, females tend to give birth at the same time. A litter of one to six, usually two or three, is born after a gestation period of 100-119 days. A female normally gives birth every 18 - 26 months, but if an entire litter is lost, she may mate again within a few days. A heavily pregnant female will leave the pride when birth is imminent and find a suitable place to give birth. The site must be free of drafts, with protection from the sun and rain and well hidden from enemies.\nThe mother lion keeps her cubs by themselves for the first few weeks, but then introduces them to the pride. The newborns weigh about 1,300 grams each, are 30 cm in length and their coats are spotted. Their eyes open at two weeks and the milk teeth appear at three weeks after birth. Cubs are suckled for about six months from any lactating female in the pride. From three months onwards, an increasing proportion of their food is meat. Once they are four months old the cubs follow their mother everywhere. Cubs begin to participate in kills at 11 months and are fully dependent on the adults for food until 16 months. Sexual maturity is attained at two to three years. Growth continues until the age of six. Lions live up to 15 years in the wild and 25 years in captivity.\nBreeding occurs at any time of the year and a pair of lions can mate up to 40 times in a day.

Sexual maturity is attained at two to three years. Growth continues until the age of six. Lions live up to 15 years in the wild and 25 years in captivity.\nAdaptation:\nThreats to Survival:\nThe lion is powerfully built, with a broad head, thick, strong legs and a tail tipped with a tuft of black hair. The body is very muscular with less bone mass than any other animal of comparable size. Both sexes have large amber eyes, their eyes being the biggest of any meat-eating animal. Lion coloration in general varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish, or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. Lion cubs are born with brown rosettes (spots) on their body, rather like those of a leopard. Although these fade as lions reach adulthood, faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts, particularly on females.Male and female lions are sexually dimorphic; they differ in size and appearance. Female lions are smaller than males and have a uniformly coloured coat of a tawny brown color. Females lack a mane. Males have a thick, woolly mane of fur that frames their face and covers their neck. It varies in colour from light yellow to black. Body colour also varies from tawny-yellow to reddish-brown.Males: Length: 1.7 - 2.5 m Height: 123 cm Weight: 150-250 kgFemale: Length: 1.4 - 1.8 m Height: 107 cm Weight: 120-182 kgTail Length: 60-100 cmLions have excellent sense of sight. Like the eyes of other cats, lion\u2019s eyes are specially designed for seeing at night. Their sense of smell is well developed. Lions mark their territories by means of scent deposits, necessitating a good sense of smell. This also helps them to find kills made by other predators. Lions and all cats possess a special olfactory organ on the roof of the mouth called the Jacobson\u2019s organ. A lion (or even your cat) may be seen grimacing when smelling something. They are opening their lips to draw air over their Jacobson\u2019s organs. This grimacing gesture is called Flehmen.Lions also have very good hearing. Lions can turn their ears from side to side to catch sounds coming from almost any direction. They can hear prey that is more than a mile away. The colour of the lion\u2019s coat camouflages it well with their surroundings, helping the lion get close to their prey without being seen. Lions have strong muscles in their chests and front legs which enables them to knock and hold down large animals. Powerful muscles and strong tendons in the rear legs provide tremendous leaping abilities. Lions normally walk at a pace of four km/h and can run for a short distance at 50 - 60 km/h.Leaps up to 12 metres vertically and 11 metres horizontally have been reported. Lions readily enter trees by jumping, but are not adept climbers. Each paw is equipped with soft rubbery pads to make its movements quiet and help them to sneak up on prey. The claws are retractable and very sharp. The retractable feature helps keep the claws sharp and prevent injury during play, etc.The tail of a lion is used for balance as well as a means to signal to each other during a group hunt. The females use their tail as a \u201cfollow-me\u201d signal for the cubs. The mane of the male lion makes him appear larger than he really is. This mane also gives him protection during battles with other male lions or predators. The mane is not fully grown until five years of age.Lions are social animals and live in a family structure called a pride. A pride of lions consists of 4 - 20 related females and their young, and usually two to four adult males. These males may succeed in holding a pride for several years. Once the cubs reach sexual maturity, the young males are driven out of the pride, while the females remain with their family. The males cooperatively defend the pride against the approach of outside males. Single males, called nomadic males, often live on their own for many years. Frequently, two or more males, often brothers, will form an association, and hunt together. Males who wish to take over a pride will challenge the male(s) in control.Lions may be active at any hour, but they are mainly nocturnal and crepuscular \u2013 hunting at dusk and dawn. The lion usually hunts by a slow stalk, alternately creeping and freezing, using every available bit of cover. When close enough, the lion then makes a final rush and leaps upon the prey. If the prey cannot be caught in a chase of 50 - 100 metres, the lion usually tires and gives up. Small prey may be killed by a swipe of the paw while larger animals are seized by the throat and strangled or suffocated. Two lions sometimes approach prey from opposite directions - if one misses then the other tries to capture it. Also, an entire pride may fan out and then close in on the quarry from all sides. Lions often work together when they hunt as this cooperation increases their chances of getting food. In a pride of lions, the females do almost all the hunting. After a successful hunt, the males of the pride eat first, then the females, and lastly, the cubs.A lion has 30 teeth. Four large pointed teeth (canines) are used to hold its prey, kill it and tear it apart. Four cheek teeth called carnassial teeth are for cutting through tough skin and tendons. Lions have no teeth suitable for chewing, thus they will swallow their food in chunks. The lion eats anything it can catch and kill, but it depends mostly on animals weighing 50 - 300 kg. Up to 40 kg of meat can be consumed by an adult male at one meal. Lions are also expert scavengers and obtain as much as 40% of their food by stealing it from other predators, or finding already dead animals. For many old males, too old to catch live game, scavenging may be their only way to find food. The average period of inactivity is 20-21 hours per day.The lion has at least nine distinct vocalizations, including a series of grunts that serve to maintain contact as a pride moves about. The roar can be heard up to nine km away and is usually given shortly after sundown for about an hour, and then again following a kill and after eating. This has a territorial function. The lion also proclaims its territory by scent marking through urination, defecation, and rubbing its head on bushes.Lions are losing their habitat due to the expansion of human activity (primarily agriculture) and human settlement. Lions are also hunted for sport and persecuted as a predator where they come into conflict with domestic cattle herds."}

Their slow, calculated movements and \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn\u201d gaze are enough to have them named \u201cThe King of the Jungle (or Plains, in this case)\u201d! That said, there is another factor that heavily contributes to their status as an emperor: The Mane. But are its uses just cosmetic? Let\u2019s find out!\nHere are 10 facts about the legendary black-maned lion:\nGenerally speaking, the lions living in the colder climates have longer and darker manes. Lions with darker manes are more attractive to the lioness. Yes! It seems that Black as a \u201cdress code\u201d is not a fashion statement only in humans. Lioness like a rich and thick mane but love if it is flecked with some black! This, in turn, is connected to our next point\u2026 Black-maned male lions produce more testosterone than blonde-maned lions. So, you see, nature had gone out of its way to supply the black mane with more female attention. There is convincing evidence to suggest that cubs born to dark-mane lions have a better rate of survival than their blonde counterparts. Though the claim that a richer mane offers lions with better protection is contentious, comparative studies have revealed that in the areas populated by both types of lions, black manes end up sustaining fewer injuries. Also when the injuries themselves were compared, it was found that they were much less frequent around the mane area of thicker maned lions.\nArticle continued below Bigger manes also help in fights! They appear more intimidating to the other lions because they naturally look larger, especially when puffed! And if they are black, well, their reputation precedes them. Black manes are indicative of a better diet and better health than any other colored mane. Studies have shown that a lion with a darker mane is getting better food and is at his prime with the ladies. Not all of the effects of a black mane are good, though. Dark colors trap more heat and are thicker, so lions with dark manes suffer more from heat than the other ones. The heat is trapped inside the manes making life miserable for them. Some lions even lessen their food intake because of this and travel and hunt only by night. Global warming trends show that this because of the sun getting more brutal, black manes might soon disappear as heat wearies it considerably. In fact, manes overall are getting thinner. The Barbary Lion of the Atlas Mountains and the Cape lion of South Africa are now more or less extinct. These are just two of the subspecies, there might be more to follow.\nBonus Point! A lion\u2019s mane might even darken or lighten depending on the nourishment he has been getting! This can also be used to study the effects of the environment and environmental change."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Hyena images!\nHyenas are animals that are biologically closer to cats than dogs.\nHumans tend to make snap judgments about these animals. We think of them as savage gluttons with demonic laughs. But it\u2019s an unfair characterization. In reality, they are sociable and smart. Plus, they play a vital role in the African, Middle Eastern, and Asian ecosystems. Hyenas rival lions in terms of predatory prowess and the spotted hyena\u2019s community structure will make you shout, \u201cno way!\u201d So, let\u2019s abandon our assumptions and dive into the wild and wondrous world of these animals.\n9 Fascinating Hyena Facts\nTalking hyenas are a staple in Disney animated features, including Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp, Noah\u2019s Ark, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and, of course, The Lion King.\nIn 1999, the lions and hyenas of Ethiopia\u2019s Gobele wilderness went to war. The situation grew so deadly that the military intervened. In the end, the lions killed 35 hyenas, and the hyenas managed to kill six lions.\nIn some parts of Somalia, these animals are a delicacy.\nSome species have bright white feces due to the large amount of calcified bones they eat.\nFemales dominate in spotted hyena clans.\nContrary to popular belief, hyenas have more in common with cats than dogs.\nThe 26th president of the United States, Teddy Roosevelt, maintained an animal menagerie that included a hyena.\nAncient Greeks and Romans believed hyena parts were effective shields against evil and ensured fertility.\nHyenas have one of the strongest bite forces in the animal kingdom. The spotted hyena has a bite force of 1,100 PSI, whih is slightly below a polar bear\u2019s bite force of 1,200 PSI. Hyenas have a bite force that\u2019s greater than lions.\nScientific Name\nThe scientific name for hyena is Hyaenidae, which doubles as the animal\u2019s taxonomic family that includes four extant species dispersed over three genera.\nThese include:\nAardwolf (Proteles cristata)\nBrown hyena (Hyaena brunnea)\nSpotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta)\nStriped hyena (Hyaena hyaena)\nAardwolf Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for aardwolves \u2014 which means \u201cearth-wolves\u201d in the Afrikaans and Dutch languages \u2014 is Proteles cristata. Proteles is a portmanteau of two ancient Greek words, teleos and protos, which roughly translate to \u201ccomplete\u201d and \u201cfront or first,\u201d respectively. Combined, they mean \u201ccomplete in front,\u201d a reference to the aardwolf\u2019s five-toed front feet.\nCristata derives from the Latin word \u201ccristatus,\u201d which means \u201cprovided with a comb,\u201d a reference to the animal\u2019s mane.\nOther names for aardwolf include \u201cmaanhaar-jackal,\u201d \u201cany hyena,\u201d \u201ctermite-eating hyena,\u201d and \u201ccivet hyena.\u201d The Nama people use \u201c|g\u012bb\u201d to label the animal.\nBrown Hyena Scientific Name\nHyaena brunnea is the scientific name for the brown hyena. Hyaena derives from the ancient Greek word \u201chyaina,\u201d which evolved from \u201chys,\u201d meaning hog or pig. Under the Roman pen, hyaina became hyaena, and when Middle English emerged as the prominent language, hyaena morphed into hyena.\nBrunnea comes from the Latin word \u201cbrunneus,\u201d which means \u201cbrown.\u201d\nBrown hyenas are also known as strandwolves.\nSpotted Hyena Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for the spotted hyena is Crocuta crocuta. For decades, people thought \u201ccrocuta\u201d came from the Latin word \u201ccrocutus,\u201d which means \u201csaffron-colored one,\u201d but they were wrong. The taxonomic label for spotted hyenas comes from the ancient Greek word \u201c\u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2,\u201d which translates to \u201cgolden jackal.\u201d\nColloquially, spotted hyenas are also known as laughing hyenas.\nStriped Hyena Scientific Name\nHyaena hyaena is the scientific name for striped hyenas. As we discussed under the brown hyena section, Hyaena derives from the ancient word \u201chyaina,\u201d which relates to wild pigs. The Greeks associated the two animals because they both had manes.\nHyena Appearance\nThese animals belong to the carnivorous suborder Feliformia \u2014 sometimes called Feloidea \u2014 which includes meat-eating mammals with \u201ccat-like\u201d physical and behavioral features. Currently, there are four species of these animals scavenging throughout large swaths of Africa, the Middle East, and Eurasia.\nGenerally speaking, hyenas are four-legged animals with scraggly fur and large ears. Interestingly, they have both feline and canine features, and all sport manes. They also have downward sloping spines, long front legs, and short hind legs. Learn about the ugliest animals on earth here.\nAardwolves, brown -, and striped hyenas have lined coats. The spotted hyena, as its name suggests, sports dotted pelage. Like dogs, their short claws are non-retractable, but they have more ribs than canids and rough tongues similar to felines.\nMale individuals in the aardwolf, striped, and spotted hyena species are usually larger than their female counterparts. In the spotted variety community, however, the women are bigger. They dominant the males and even have external genitalia.\nHow Big Are Hyenas?\nHyenas vary in size depending on the species and sex.\nSpecies Sex Average Height Average Length Average Weight Aardwolf Female 16 to 20 inches 22 to 31 inches 15 to 22 pounds Aardwolf Male 16 to 20 inches 22 to 31 inches 15 to 22 pounds Brown Female 28 to 31 inches 51 to 63 inches 83 to 89 pounds Brown Male 28 to 31 inches 51 to 63 inches 89 to 96 pounds Spotted Female 28 to 36 inches 37 to 65 inches 98 to 153 pounds Spotted Male 28 to 36 inches 37 to 65 inches 89 to 149 pounds Striped Female 24 to 31 inches 33 to 51 inches 49 to 121 pounds Striped Male 24 to 31 inches 33 to 51 inches 49 to 121 pounds\nHyena Behavior\nLike house cats, these animals are avid groomers that also mark territory, but they use anal glands instead of urination. They\u2019re primarily a nocturnal species, though spotted hyenas occasionally venture out during the day, especially if humans aren\u2019t poking around.\nThe striped variety typically lives alone or in pairs, though some populations travel in packs up to seven-deep. Spotted hyenas are the exception. Exceptionally sociable, they live in highly organized communities of up to 80 individuals. Matriarchal and monarchical by nature, females of the species dominate. Plus, when a pack leader dies, her oldest daughter automatically takes over!\nMostly they burrow in caves and under crevices. Striped hyenas also dig dens.\nThe animals vocalize loudly and frequently. However, not all species laugh, as is often assumed. In fact, spotted hyenas are the only extant species known for laughing. Notably, they use about a dozen distinct grunts, laughs, and barks to communicate with their clan members about food and migration efficiently.\nHyena Habitat\nThese animals live throughout Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Aardwolves roam in southern and eastern Africa, whereas brown hyenas stick to South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana, with some overflow into Angola, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique. The spotted variety\u2019s range is central, western, and southern Africa, though very few live in South Africa. Striped hyenas cover northern Africa, the Middle East, and large swaths of India.\nAardwolves live in bushlands and heavily grazed arid plains where termites \u2014 an essential part of their diet \u2014 are plentiful. Typically, aardwolves stay in the same place for about six weeks and cluster their dens together.\nDeserts and coastal lands are where you\u2019ll find the brown variety, whereas spotted populations favor woodlands, savannahs, semi-deserts, and hilly forests below 4,000 meters. Striped hyenas prefer dry woodlands in mountainous regions, savannahs, and dense grasslands. Typically, they make dens in rocky outcrops, ravines, and crevices.\nHyena Diet\nThese animals are primarily scavengers, but they also kill prey. As carnivores, they mostly consume meat but have been known to supplement their diets with fruit in tough times. They are also members of the \u201cclean plate club,\u201d meaning they eat every last bit of a kill, including bones and hooves. Plus, they aren\u2019t particularly picky about what type of meat they eat.\nThese animals have digestive systems made of steel! So much so that field scientists and anthropologists often report of them feasting on inanimate objects, like tires and tent materials.\nAardwolf Diet\nAardwolves\u2019 primary source of nourishment is termites from the genus Trinervitermes. Using sound and scent clues, aardwolves locate the crawlers and lick them off the ground using their sticky tongues. In a single night, an individual aardwolf may consume upwards of 250,000 insects. Conscious of their constant need for sustenance, aardwolves never eat an entire pile of termites. Instead, they leave it partly intact, and the mound serves as a replenishing source.\nThe aardwolf diet differs from other hyena species because it doesn\u2019t include any carrion, which is the meat of an already killed animal. Instead, aardwolves stick to insects and larva.\nBrown Hyena Diet\nThese animals aren\u2019t great hunters. As such, they rely on carcasses killed by other predators. They also supplement their meals with rodents, insects, eggs, fruit, and fungi.\nSpotted Hyena Diet\nSpotted hyenas, arguably the most aggressive Hyaenidae species, differ from their cousins because they primarily hunt prey instead of sticking to carrion. Except for spotted populations in west Africa, who largely scavenge for meat, the species preys on large, hooved, plant-eating animals, including, but not limited to, wildebeests, giraffes, gazelles, impalas, gemsboks, sheep, goats, and cattle. They\u2019ve also been known to catch fish, and, on rare occasions, humans!\nThese animals have huge appetites. A single individual can pack away up to 32 pounds of meat in a single feeding!\nStriped Hyena Diet\nThese animals are scavengers who eat almost any meat, though they turn their noses up at vulture flesh. They also feast liberally on bones and bone marrow.\nHyena Predators and Threats\nLions are These animals\u2019 primary foe even though the former usually don\u2019t eat the latter. But lions see them as fellow apex predators and will kill them to reduce competition. Similarly, in the Middle East, striped hyenas compete with wolves for food. But at times, the two animals cooperate and travel in joint-species hunting packs.\nLeopards also prey on these animals in certain regions.\nAccording to conservationists, aardwolf and spotted hyenas currently enjoy stable wild populations and don\u2019t face imminent extinction. Striped and brown varieties aren\u2019t as fortunate because humans are increasingly encroaching on their natural habitats and killing them at alarming rates using traps, poison, and wire snares. Farmers often eliminate brown hyenas in retaliation for livestock deaths. In reality, though, they don\u2019t kill prey; they only scavenge for dead animals, which sometimes includes already deceased livestock.\nHyena Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nHyena Reproduction\nSpotted, brown, and aardwolf hyenas copulate with several partners in a lifetime. Striped hyenas, on the other hand, are monogamous, meaning they mate with the same partner for most of their lives.\nFor the spotted variety, mating is an awkward and tricky process since both the male and female have genitalia on the outside of their bodies. The male has to position himself just right in order to successfully mate with the female. This process often is described as a dance because of all the jumping around he has to do.\nSpecies Gestation Period Mating Season Litter Size Parental Responsibility Aardwolf 89 to 92 days Spring or Autumn depending on location; July in South Africa 2 to 5 cubs Both parents raise cubs Brown 90 days May to August, but occasionally mate out of season 1 to 5 Cubs Males help provide food for cubs Spotted 110 days All year, but prefer wet season 2 Cubs No male help Striped 90 to 91 days Either January and February or October and November depending on location 1 to 6 Cubs Both parents raise cubs\nBabies\nThe babies are called cubs. At birth, aardwolves, brown, and striped hyenas are born with closed eyes and require adult help. Spotted hyenas, however, are born fully developed, with open eyes and teeth!\nLifespan\nThese animals usually live for about 12 years, but they can live up to 25 years. Brown hyenas, however, typically have shorter lives.\nThe oldest specimen ever was a male spotted hyena named Mars who lived in the Honolulu Zoo with his brother, Whoops. Both arrived in 1992, and both had unusually long lives. Mars broke the record with 28.5 years, and Whoops made it to 26!\nPopulation\nAccording to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, aardwolves and spotted hyenas are populations of least concern, meaning they\u2019re currently not in danger of extinction. However, brown and striped hyenas are classified as near threatened, and scientists are employing conservation efforts to combat declining population numbers.\nView all 71 animals that start with H"}

Mountain lion, puma, cougar, panther\u2014this cat is known by more names than just about any other mammal! But no matter what you call it, it\u2019s still the same cat, Puma concolor, the largest of the \"small cats.\" So how did it get so many names? Mostly because it has such a large range, and people from different countries have called it different things.\nEarly Spanish explorers of North and South America called it leon (lion) and gato monte (cat of the mountain), from which we get the name \"mountain lion.\" \u201cPuma\u201d is the name the Incas gave this cat in their language. \u201cCougar\u201d seems to have come from an old South American Indian word, cuguacuarana, which was shortened to \"cuguar\" and then spelled differently. And \u201cpanther\u201d is a general term for cats that have solid-colored coats, so it was used for black pumas as well as black jaguars and black leopards. All of these names are considered correct, but in Southern California they are commonly called mountain lions.\nYou may have heard of the Florida panther. This is a subspecies of mountain lion that used to be found from Texas throughout the southeast but is now found only in southern Florida\u2019s swamps. It is endangered, with only about 50 cats left, and conservation efforts are underway to try to save it.\nMountain lions are generally a solid tawny color, with slightly darker hair on the back and a whitish underside. Those living in warm, humid areas tend to be a darker, reddish brown color, and mountain lions found in colder climates have thicker, longer hair that is almost silver-gray in color. Adult males weigh 40 to 60 percent more than adult females. Scientists classify the mountain lion as a small cat, as it does not roar, but purrs like smaller cats do. Its slender body and calm demeanor are more like that of a cheetah; both cats would rather flee than fight, and both rarely confront humans."}

Both kinds are characterized by the long, twisting horns that grow on the heads of mature males. They also share similar habitats, body structure and coloration, although there is notable differences in size between the greater and lesser species. The kudu is an animal with passive grazing habits and natural camouflage to help them avoid being easily spotted by the many predators in their native habitat.\nAn Incredible Animal: 3 Kudu Facts!\nHigh speeds: The kudu is an animal that can reach speeds of over 60mph when attempting to escape from a predator.\nThe kudu is an animal that can reach speeds of over 60mph when attempting to escape from a predator. Ceremonial horns: The animal\u2019s spiraled horns are prized in local religious practices and are also made into musical instruments.\nThe animal\u2019s spiraled horns are prized in local religious practices and are also made into musical instruments. Polite competition: Even though males sometimes engage in rutting, they are generally not very violent when competing for mates.\nKudu Scientific Name\nKudu, alternatively spelled koodoo, is derived from the name given to the animal by the local, nomadic Khoikhoi, who are indigenous to southwestern Africa. The greater kudu is classified as Tragelaphus strepsiceros and the lesser kudu is Tragelaphus imberbis. The genus Tragelaphus shares its name with a word originally put forth by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in his oral depiction of an imagined animal that was half goat and half deer.\nKudu: The Animal\u2019s Appearance\nBoth species have similar body structure and proportions, although there are a few notable differences in their external characteristics. Both have grey to brown fur that is broken by a series of white stripes and other markings, often including a chevron visible on their nose. The lesser species typically has between 11 and 15 white stripes on their body, while the greater species usually has between 6 and 10.\nBody size is one of the key differences between the two species. The lesser species is generally 3 to 3.5 feet tall and weighs between 130 and 230 pounds. Greater kudu can reach much greater size, with a potential shoulder height of up to 5 feet and total weight of mature adults ranging between 260 and 600 pounds. The largest bull male on record weighed in at over 690 pounds.\nAll male kudu have the potential to grow spiraled horns that can be quite long relevant to their body size. Lesser kudu males can grow horns that are up to 3.5 feet long, while some greater kudu have been reported sporting horns as long as 6 feet. These horns tend to make 2 to 3 large twists as they slope backwards from the head toward the terminal point, which sets them apart from the tightly wound horns seen on other antelopes.\nAnan Kaewkhammul/Shutterstock.com\nKudu Behavior\nAs herbivores, most of the kudu biology and behavior is geared toward surviving in a potentially harsh native habitat and avoiding dangerous predators. They tend to stay very still as they graze, which allows their coloration to provide effective camouflage. They are most active during the night or morning hours and seek shelter in dense brush during the daytime. Kudu often travel in small packs or herds, but they are also frequently seen alone. Much like other kinds of antelope, these animals have a strong flight reflex and can move very quickly when confronted with an immediate threat.\nKudu: The Animal\u2019s Habitat\nBoth kudu species are native to southern and eastern portions of Africa. Greater kudu have a much greater geographic distribution that includes parts of Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya and as far south as South Africa. There are also some isolated populations of the cottoni subspecies found in central Africa. Lesser kudu have a much smaller distribution and are only found in eastern regions near the Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia and Kenya.\nThese animals have strong jumping and bulldozing potential, which helps them navigate rugged terrain around hills or mountains and forge boldly through dense brush and growth in wooded regions. They tend to inhabit woodland and forested areas, particularly along water sources. Lesser kudu are a bit less water dependent than their greater cousins. Both species can satisfy some of their water needs by seeking out certain types of plants as they graze.\nKudu Diet\nKudu are flexible foragers that consume a wide range of plant materials in woodland, thicket and open fields. Lesser kudu are known to have a diet that is mostly foliage from trees and shrubs, with most of the remaining being from vines and similar plants. However, kudu can also eat tender young shoots, plant roots and may even target some types of fruit when they can find them. Succulent plants that store water are also a prime target during the dry season. Kudu in captivity are typically fed grass or alfalfa hay alongside some natural forage and enriched pellets or biscuits.\nKudu Predators and Threats\nThe kudu share their native range with many solitary and pack predators that pose a significant threat to their survival. Perhaps the most dangerous predators are big cat species, including lions, cheetahs and leopards. Felines tend to use a combination of stealth, patience and speed to ambush the fast-acting kudu while they graze. Packs of spotted hyenas and African hunting dogs are also known to trap or track down kudu as prey.\nHumans are both a predator and serious environmental threat to the long-term viability of kudu populations. People hunt the animals for their meat, large hides and distinguished horns, which are traditionally used to make musical, ornamental and various household objects. Native habitats, especially of lesser kudu, are also threatened by the continued growth of human settlements and expansion of commercial farming enterprises throughout the region.\nLesser kudu are particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and hunting due to their small geographic distribution, which has prompted their classification as near threatened. They can also suffer significant population losses from contagious diseases like rinderpest, which has decimated numbers in the past. Greater kudu have a much bigger native range and are considered a species of least concern by conservationists.\nKudu: The Animal\u2019s Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nSome herbivores can get pretty violent during mating season, but kudu are among the more peaceful species on the continent. Males often compete by showing off their size in profile until one withdraws. However, they may physically struggle by locking horns if one of the competitors doesn\u2019t back down. Victorious ales often wrestle with females initially then follow them for a while before actually mating.\nFemales remain pregnant for about 240 days before giving birth to a single calf, which typically weighs around 10 to 15 pounds. Mothers separate from their group before they deliver their baby. They leave the calf carefully hidden in the brush while they forage during the fist 4 or 5 weeks after birth. At this point, calves accompany the mother on foraging expeditions until it is about 6 months old.\nDespite the care and attention that mother kudu show their young, roughly half of calves die before the 6 month mark. Researchers estimate that only about 1 in 4 individuals make it to 3 years old. Kudu reach sexual maturity within a few years, but males are rarely successful at mating until they are about 4 or 5 years old. Aside from high death rates during youth, the animals often live to be 10 to 15 years old in the wild and up to 20 in captivity.\nVilliers Steyn/Shutterstock.com\nKudu Population\nResearchers estimate there are less than 100,000 lesser kudu remaining in Africa. Their limited native range combined with significant habitat disruption by humans is a serious cause for concern. About a third of them currently live in National Parks and other protected areas.\nExact population numbers for greater kudu are unknown, although the extremely limited range of the cottoni subspecies, found only in Chad and Sudan, means it could be a candidate for endangerment.\nAnimals in the Zoo: Where to find the Kudu\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo has a small population of kudu available for visitors to observe. They reported the birth of a male kudu calf in 2019. Over a dozen other city and state zoos across the country, including the Maryland Zoo, also have lesser kudu on display for interested viewers.\nView all 43 animals that start with K"}

The cougar is unable to roar because it doesn\u2019t have the needed larynx to do so. Instead, the big cat purrs, growls, hisses and screams as well as whistles and chirps. Cougars are also called pumas, panthers and mountain lions. The cats have round heads, pointed ears and slender bodies.\nAnimal Top Facts\n\u2022 Cougars are superior hunters\n\u2022 Cougars are animals that are found in many parts of the world\n\u2022 Cougars dine on animals like deer, raccoons and even crocodiles\n\u2022 Like most felines, cougars are solitary animals\nCougar Scientific Name\nThe cougar is known by the scientific name \u201cpuma concolor\u201d or \u201cfelis concolor.\u201d Carl Linnaeus proposed the name \u201cfelis concolor\u201d to describe a big cat that has a long tail. The animal has more names in the dictionary than any other animal. Along with mountain lion and puma, the cat is also called catamount and red tiger among others. Cougars belong to the subfamily Felinae. After Linnaeus introduced a scientific description of cougars, researchers listed 32 zoological subspecies until the late \u201880s. According to genetic studies, many of the subspecies were too close to be considered separate. Now, scientists have determined that there are six phylogeographic groups.\nCougar Appearance\nA cougar\u2019s body is similar to that of a house cat on a larger scale. Mountain lion coats are a grayish tan to a reddish hue, and the animal features lighter parts underneath. The end of a cougar\u2019s tail is black, and the cat has black markings on its ears and face. An amazing fact about cougars is that they can jump 20 feet into the air. This allows them to pounce on prey that\u2019s 20 feet to 40 feet away from a standing position. Learn more about the highest jumping animals in the world here.\nPumas range from 5 feet to 9 feet in length from head to tail with male cougars weighing as much as 150 pounds and females topping out at about 100 pounds.\nCougar Behavior\nMountain lions are solitary animals unless a mother cougar is raising cubs. On occasion, the animals will share kills with one another. They establish themselves in small communities based around the territories of strong male cougars. Cats that live within these areas socialize with one another more often than animals that are outside of them.\nCougar Habitat\nThese big cats have one of the largest ranges of any wild animal species throughout the Americas. You\u2019ll find them from Canada\u2019s northern Yukon to the southern Andes. The animal is able to adapt to a variety of habitats including forests, mountainous deserts and lowland areas. Cougars prefer to live in parts of the country that feature steep canyons, rim rocks and dense brush for protection. However, they can survive well in open areas that have very little vegetation.\nWhat Do Cougars Eat?\nThese big cats aren\u2019t picky about their diets. They\u2019ll dine on insects, mice, beavers, raccoons, rabbits, and wild turkeys. Since cougars live in Patagonia\u2019s Monte Leon National Park, they\u2019ve become quite skilled at hunting penguins. Those that live in Florida sometimes make a meal out of a crocodile. In North America, cougars frequently eat deer. In fact, they typically kill one large deer every two weeks. These large felines are not generally scavengers, but if a deer carcass has been left exposed, then they may eat it, meaning that the cats sometimes display resourceful behavior.\nBecause of their powerful hind legs, cougars are ambush predators. They are hunters that stalk their victims through brush and trees before leaping powerfully onto it, delivering a deadly neck bite. The animal is able to break the neck of its prey with one strong bite and the force of driving its prey to the earth.\nCougar Predators\nHumans are the biggest predators of cougars with people hunting them for sport and to protect livestock. People are also the main cause of the cats losing their habitats. In states like Florida, highways are often deadly to cougars. Out in the wild, wolf packs will prey on the cats because they\u2019re able to surround the animal and overwhelm it with numbers. When it comes to a one-on-one battle, the cougar will usually survive the match. Wolves are more likely to affect cougars by dominating the same territory and taking advantage of prey opportunities. Wolves can also disrupt the cougar\u2019s ability to reproduce.\nThe feline is not on the endangered species list, but conservation groups remain unsure about how well the cougar population is doing around the world. In the United States, the only state that prohibits hunting them is California. However, it is illegal to hunt them in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela, Brazil and throughout most of Argentina. To hunt the big cat in the U.S., hunters must obtain a permit unless they live in Texas.\nPoachers target cougars, but the effects of this action on the cat are unknown. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that the illegal animal part trade is a $200 million a year market, and it\u2019s growing.\nAbout Cougar Reproduction\nMale and female mountain lions reach sexually maturity at 24 months, but according to research, females have mated as young as 20 months. The age in which a cougar first breeds often depends upon her establishing a home range. A major breeding challenge that cougars face is finding each other due to their solitary lifestyle. The cats are usually scattered across hundreds of miles of rough terrain.\nAnother reproduction complication is that female cougars are only interested in mating for several days out of a month. Despite the challenges, the animals find a way to breed. They have keen senses and practice polygamy. When cougars breed, they do so vigorously by copulating at a rate of 50 times to 70 times within a 24-hour period for 7 to 8 days. Each time a couple copulates, it lasts less than a minute. Because the felines are so vigorous, researchers believe that the act stimulates ovulation, which is when the ovaries release an egg so that it can be fertilized.\nCougar Cubs\nOnce a female cougar conceives, after 88 to 96 days, she will retire to the privacy of a den and give birth to a litter of cubs. Cougar litters vary in size from one to six cubs with the average size being two to three kittens. A young female cougar may only have one cub for her first litter. Researchers believe that this gives young females time to develop their mothering skills. Cougars generally bear young every other year, which means that a female mountain lion that lives for 8 to 10 years may be able to produce five litters. According to reports, one mother cougar in captivity produced seven litters in 16 years.\nBaby cougars usually weigh slightly more than 1 pound when they are born. Within 10 to 20 days, they grow double their weight, and by the time they reach 2 months of age, they can weigh as much as 9 pounds.\nWhen cougar babies are born, their coats typically have black spots, which camouflage them, protecting the juveniles from predators. The spots generally last for about 6 months. Baby cubs are born deaf, blind and almost immobile, making them vulnerable to predators. To gain strength and learn how to take down their prey, cougar cubs play and pounce on one another.\nMother cougars start taking their cubs to kills when they reach 7 to 8 weeks of age. The female will also take meat to her babies until she weans them when they\u2019re 2 to 3 months old. As the cubs grow, the female will leave them at a kill site for several days at a time while she hunts for their next meal. Mother cougars will travel further in search of food as her cubs become older and stronger.\nCougar Lifespan\nWhen a cougar is in captivity, the animal can live for as long as 20 years. However, there is a report of one captive cougar that lived to be 29. In the wild, their lifespan is about half that. Researchers disagree about which sex lives longer. Some say that females live for fewer years due to the stress of having and raising cubs.\nEven when humans are not threatening them, cougars tend to have a high-risk lifestyle. They are frequently exposed to injury or death because they target animals that are larger than themselves. When they are attacking elk or deer, they may be thrown against a tree or a rock hard enough to break their backs. Sometimes, they are trampled by the hooves of herd animals. Cougars can be impaled by a branch or an antler, and an injury like this may result in starvation. The cats die from lightning strikes, poisonous snake bites and rock slides.\nCougar Population\nResearchers have been unable to provide an exact estimate regarding how many cougars are in the wild. Some believe that there are an estimated 30,000 of them throughout the American west. The density of cougars generally ranges from one to seven cats for every 100 kilometers of territory with males permitting several females to be present in their ranges. Oregon estimates that its cougar population is around 6,600 while California believes that it has between 4,000 and 6,000 of the animals.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature, which tracks the cougar population in each Central and South American country, reports that there are less than 50,000 of the big cats populating that part of the world. This is thought to be a declining trend. However, cougar researchers in the U.S. believe that the country\u2019s population is rebounding. California has protections in place for its cougar population, but thirteen states including Wyoming, Colorado and Utah classify them as a game species, allowing people to hunt them for sport.\nView all 153 animals that start with C"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Albino animals - facts and information", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/albino-animals", "text": "Although rare in nature, albino animals have been spotted everywhere from the skies to the seas. These unique creatures have partial or complete loss of pigmentation, hence their pale skin tone compared to other members of their species. Even though the birth of an albino animal is considered a sacred or auspicious event in some cultures, research suggests that some albino animals have difficulty in the wild.\nWhat is albinism?\nIn mammals, albinism occurs when an individual inherits one or more mutated genes from both parents that interfere with the body\u2019s production of melanin, the main pigment that determines the color of skin, fur, and eyes. The production of melanin occurs within melanocytes, specialized cells that are present but not fully functional in albino mammals.\nNon-mammal animals can also be albino, but because they can produce other pigments in addition to melanin, they may not appear fully white. Even albino mammals can show some color if their melanin-making genes haven\u2019t been totally damaged.\nIt\u2019s important to note that not all white animals are albino. Some animals are simply light-skinned, or they might suffer from other conditions, such as leucism and isabellinism. To tell the difference between an albino animal and one without the disease, look at the eyes: blood vessels normally masked by pigment show through in albino creatures, making their eyes pinkish in color.\nSurviving with albinism\nAlbino wildlife may face obstacles in nature. They often have poor eyesight, which puts them at a disadvantage when hunting for food and avoiding danger. In some cases they have trouble finding a mate, and their inability to camouflage themselves makes them vulnerable to predators. Take albino alligators, for instance, who make such an obvious target for predators that they\u2019re often eaten before they reach adulthood.\nAlbino animals and other unusually pale wildlife are also more vulnerable to poachers looking to capitalize on booming demand for exotic pets or products derived from rare creatures. The threat to these animals is so real that a nonprofit bought an island off Indonesia just so that it could build a sanctuary there for an albino orangutan, who will be protected by security guards nonstop when she moves there in June 2019. Many albino animals are also sent to zoos for protection. One of the most well-known albino zoo animals was Snowflake, a gorilla featured in National Geographic magazine who died from skin cancer in 2003.\nIn addition to poachers, some trophy hunters also favor the rare. Albino deer are so enticing to hunters, for example, that several U.S. states prohibit them from being hunted.\nSome albino creatures do find success in the wild, however. In Olney, Illinois, there\u2019s a thriving population of nearly a hundred albino squirrels. The town is so proud of them that it encourages residents to feed them and has passed laws to protect them from being hit by vehicles."}

Its bright facial colors and oddly shimmering fur are instant head turners for gawking tourists and zoo-goers alike. However, the spread of human civilization has threatened the survival of the species throughout its native habitat in Africa.\n3 Incredible Mandrill Facts\nThe mandrill is an animal that displays a vivid and striking coloration around the body that defies easy description. This feature once led Charles Darwin to write, \u201cNo other member in the whole class of mammals is colored in so extraordinary a manner as the adult male mandrills.\u201d\naround the body that defies easy description. This feature once led Charles Darwin to write, \u201cNo other member in the whole class of mammals is colored in so extraordinary a manner as the adult male mandrills.\u201d Mandrills store food in their extra large cheek pouches .\nin their . The character of Rafiki from The Lion King, though described as a baboon, appears to have the colorful face of the mandrill.\nMandrill Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for the mandrill is Mandrillus sphinx. It is named after the ancient Greek mythological figure that had the head of a human and the body of an animal, perhaps reflecting its strange appearance. The mandrill is only one of two living species in the genus. The other living species is the Mandrillus leucophaeus, commonly known as just the drill. Both of these species have similar social structures, habitats, and appearances, but the drill is also far less colorful than its vivacious sibling.\nThe mandrill is part of the family Cercopithecidae, which includes all Old World monkeys. As the name implies, the Old World monkeys live exclusively in Africa and Asia. This distinguishes them from the New World monkeys, which live in the Americas. The physical differences between them are subtle, but Old World monkeys lack a prehensile tail and have a more prominent nose.\nMandrill Appearance\nUnique in appearance, the mandrill is an animal that features a very long muzzle, a prominent brow, and a short, almost nonexistent tail. This is complemented by an elegant coat of dark green and gray fur with tufts of white hair on its stomach and a long, yellow beard. Combined with its long, muscular limbs, compact body, and enlarged head, the mandrill looks a bit unusual to the human eye, as if it was put together from various parts. But the species is actually quite adept and agile with a large range of movements and postures. Though normally walking on all fours limbs, the mandrill can also sit or lay down on its rather thick rear end. It also has opposable thumbs and big toes for grasping objects and climbing trees. The animal spends part of its life above ground, jumping from branch to branch.\nThe most recognizable aspect of the mandrill\u2019s appearance is the exotic markings on certain parts of the body, including the bright red ridges of the nose and mouth, light blue cheeks, and colorful rear end. These markings actually serve an important social function. When incensed or worked up, some of the colors on the body will become more intense. A display of the rump may also demonstrate submissiveness or female mating availability.\nIn sheer size, the mandrill is perhaps the largest of the Old World monkeys. The male of the species can weigh around 70 pounds and possibly more than 100 pounds while reaching a height of more than 30 inches. The mandrill size is about the same as a large dog. However, the female is significantly smaller than the male; it weighs only around 30 pounds. This extreme difference between the mandrill size in sexes is one of the largest among primates. Another important sexual distinction is that the males tend to sport brighter colors. This has important implications for the mating behavior of the species, since brighter colors may signify dominance.\nMandrill Teeth\nThe massive canine teeth are normally hidden from view, but when the mandrill opens its mouth, they become very apparent.\nMandrill Ryan E. Poplin / Creative Commons\nMandrill Behavior\nColoration is only one aspect of the mandrill\u2019s vast array of communication strategies. Visual signals, body posture, scent markers, and vocalizations are used to convey all sorts of information for mating, playfulness, warnings, and other behavior. For example, the exposure of teeth is one of the most common signals. It is actually a sign of friendliness and joviality rather than an aggressive action. If the mandrill does become angered, then it will visibly slap the ground with its hands and stare with intensity at its target. Grooming is another common behavior that helps to reinforce bonds between members of the group. They will also use various vocal sounds such as grunts and howls to communicate mood, especially if they lose visual contact with each other. And the presence of a scent gland on the chest enables them to signal their presence by rubbing various chemicals on objects.\nBecause social relations are such an important aspect of their behavior, mandrills seek safety in large numbers. A single group, known as a troop or horde, can consist of around 50 members, though some groups may join together for short periods of time. The largest group ever recorded was around 1,200. The horde has a distinct social hierarchy in which every member has a place. At the top of the hierarchy is a single dominant male who has exclusive breeding rights and the responsibility to defend the group from outside threats. The health and stability of the entire horde can often depend on the actions of the leader.\nMale and female mandrills exhibit very different relationships within and to the group. Males tend to wander away from the group after reaching full maturity and will sometimes form all-male bachelor groups. The females stay within the same group of their birth, which often allows them to form strong lifelong bonds with each other.\nMandrill intelligence isn\u2019t quite as well-explored by scientists as gorillas and chimpanzees, but observations in captivity and the wild have documented a variety of different tool uses, both to hunt for food and for grooming. Studies also suggest that they are capable of displaying decent long term memory, facial recognition, and problem solving.\nMandrill Habitat\nMandrills primarily live in the forests of Western Africa, often adjacent to rivers, wetlands, or savannas. The animal\u2019s main range straddles the countries of Congo, Gabon, Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea. Although primarily adapted for a terrestrial lifestyle, this species actually gathers together at night in the trees for safety and comfort. They have a tendency to switch between different trees every night within their range.\nMandrill Population\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, which classifies the conservation status of many species, mandrills are currently vulnerable to extinction. Exact population numbers are unknown, but habitat destruction from agriculture, industry, and human settlements appears to be the leading cause of their slow decline. Mandrill bushmeat, or the hunting of wildlife for food, is still an ongoing practice in 21st century Africa as well. In order to prevent their extinction, conservation efforts are focused on the institution of anti-poaching and surveillance measures to prevent excessive hunting. Conservationists also need to work with local governments to halt the decline of the natural habitats. Mandrills don\u2019t yet need emergency measures to survive, but the downward trend in numbers is worrying.\nMandrill Diet\nMandrills are expert foragers that hunt both plants and small animals such as fungi, roots, seeds, fruit, insects, worms, amphibians, lizards, snakes, snails, eggs, and small mammals. Their diet is truly prolific and may include as many as a hundred different species. The mandrill sexes pursue different hunting strategies. Adult males tend to forage on the ground, whereas the females and children tend to forage in the trees. The mandrills play an important ecological role by helping to disperse seeds around the local forest environment.\nMandrill Predators and Threats\nBecause of their large size, mandrills have few natural predators in the wild, except for leopards and, of course, humans, who have traditionally hunted them for food. Mandrills may be killed by accidental contact with venomous snakes too. The size of the group alone provides plenty of protection against danger, but if an individual is cornered, then the large canine teeth also provide a suitable defense. More recently, habitat loss has been another significant danger to their continued existence.\nMandrill Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nMandrills form a harem-type society in which a single male has exclusive mating rights with a group of females. In an interesting twist, the females actually choose which males they will breed with. One theory is that the females select the male with the brightest colors, because the intensity of the colors is a direct reflection of the male\u2019s testosterone level, which denotes its health and physical viability. This is an example of sexual selection in which one sex develops exaggerated features to convey information and help the opposite sex choose an appropriate mate. Another possibility is that male coloration becomes brighter only after being selected by females. Either way, male aggression does occur and sometimes turns deadly, but it\u2019s not as pronounced as you might expect.\nThe timing of the breeding season varies based on food supply, but it tends to occur every two years between the months of July and October. The female will carry the young for about six months until around January to March before finally giving birth. Only one mandrill is produced at a time, while twins have only been in observed in captivity. For the first two months of its life, the young mandrill sports a black coat and pink skin, which will develop into its regular coat over the ensuing months and years. The mother provides the vast majority of the protection, feeding, and grooming, while the father contributes very little directly but may help indirectly by protecting the group.\nAfter achieving independence, the young mandrill must find food on its own and work its way through the ranks of the group hierarchy. A female mandrill will reach sexual maturity after a minimum of four years. Males, on the other hand, take a full nine years to reach sexual maturity. Mandrills typically live more than 20 years in the wild. The highest lifespan ever recorded was 46 years in captivity.\nMandrills in the Zoo\nMandrills are a regular fixture at the San Diego Zoo. The first pair of mandrills, Peter and Suzy, arrived in 1923 but never reproduced with each other. The zoo later established a breeding program in 1938 and maintained a consistence presence of mandrills ever since, even welcoming a new child in 2016. Mandrills are also a regular sight at the Denver Zoo, the San Francisco Zoo, and the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.\nView all 111 animals that start with M"}

This cat belongs to the Felidae family and is a member of the Mammalia class. The name caracal comes from a Turkish word, karakulak. Karakulak means black ear.\nCaracal Appearance & Behavior\nA caracal has a sleek coat of reddish gold short hair and a line of white fur around each of its eyes. This cat\u2019s ears stand straight up and are topped off by long black tufts of hair. No one is sure why caracal ears have tufts of hair on them. But, some scientists believe that caracals communicate with one another by twitching their ears.\nA caracal\u2019s tail is about 8 to 13 inches long. In other words, the average caracal\u2019s tail is about as long as the ruler you use in school. A caracal\u2019s tail helps it to turn and stay on course when chasing a bird, rabbit or other prey. Think of a caracal\u2019s tail like a rudder on a boat.\nAn adult caracal can weigh from 20 to 40 pounds. To give you a better idea, a 30-pound caracal weighs as much as two bowling balls! A caracal is about 24 to 42 inches long and 18 inches tall from its shoulder. That makes it about as tall as a Border Collie.\nCaracals are closely related to servals. They are about the same size but live in different types of places. Servals like to hunt in humid, wet areas while caracals stay in dry, desert environments.\nA caracal has long, strong legs. When hunting, its legs work like coiled springs as it leaps into the air to grab a bird as it flies away.\nCaracals have sharp claws that help them to grab onto trees and climb up into the branches. They also use their claws to hunt and capture prey. Caracals mark their territory by clawing trees and releasing scent from between their toes.\nUnlike lions that live in prides, caracals live alone most of the time. They are aggressive cats and are quick to defend their territory from other animals.\nCaracal Habitat\nMost caracals live in sub-Saharan Africa as well as in parts of the Middle East. They make their home in dry environments such as savannas, woodlands and even in areas with mountains.\nThere is not much water to be found on a savanna. However, caracals don\u2019t need much water to survive. These wild cats have adapted to the lack of water by getting the fluid they need from their prey. Also, caracals have adapted to the hot climate of their environment by sleeping during the day to conserve energy and hunting at night when it\u2019s cooler. They sleep in burrows, rock crevices, dense bush or even on a branch in a tree. These cats have stiff hairs on the pads of their feet along with other types of hair allowing them to walk comfortably on the sandy ground of a savanna. Sometimes these cats can cover as many as 12 miles as they search their territory for prey.\nBecause caracals live alone and make very little sound when they move, they remain hidden most of the time. They blend in with their environment making it easy to grab prey as well as spot possible threats.\nCaracal Diet\nWhat does a caracal eat? Like other cats in the wild, a caracal is a carnivore. Its speed allows it to catch and eat many types of animals including rabbits, birds, snakes, lizards and, sometimes, insects. Sometimes a caracal will go onto a farmer\u2019s land to catch sheep, goats or other livestock to eat. Caracals eat whatever they can catch. A caracal can eat a dove one night and a young impala the next. An impala is a type of antelope. A young impala weighs around 80 pounds which equals the weight of about 13 bricks!\nCaracals avoid eating the stiff, wiry hair on the animals they catch. They use their claws to remove this hair before eating their meal. They can eat feathers with no problem and can even eat rotten meat if they\u2019re really hungry!\nCaracal Predators & Threats\nLions and hyenas are the two main predators of caracals. These three animals all hunt on the savanna, so they are likely to cross paths at some point. A caracal\u2019s speed is its most valuable defense against these animals. Also, it\u2019s coat can help it to blend in with the colorless vegetation and sand in its environment. Sometimes it will lay on the ground to avoid being seen by predators.\nHumans are also a threat to caracals. Many farmers kill caracals when these cats try to steal livestock. Plus, more people are clearing land and moving into their territory forcing out the prey of caracals. This puts these cats at risk for starving. They are also hunted for their skins by individuals who are looking for trophies.\nThe conservation status of the caracal in South Africa is recorded as: Least Concern. This means the population is not considered to be under threat at this time.\nCaracal Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nReproduction\nCaracals keep to themselves until it\u2019s time to mate. One of the most unique caracal sounds is a mating call that sounds sort of like a cough. Several male caracals may fight or compete for the attention of one female caracal. Eventually, the female chooses a male out of the group. After mating, the male leaves the female caracal so she can raise the babies on her own.\nBabies\nA caracal carries her babies, called kits, for about 69 to 81 days. She finds an old den or burrow where she can give birth away from predators and other threats. Caracals can have from 1 to 6 kits in a litter, but most have just 2. Each kit weighs about 7 to 9 ounces at birth. A caracal kit is about the size of a pet hamster. The serval and the golden cat (close relatives of the caracal) have kits of about the same size.\nKits are born with their eyes closed. This is true with domesticated kittens as well. It takes about 6 to 10 days for a kit\u2019s eyes to completely open. They are able to squirm around but can\u2019t see where they\u2019re going. The kits stop nursing and start to eat meat at 10 weeks old. Kits learn hunting skills from their mother and stay with her until they are about 10 months old. A female caracal only gives birth to one litter per year because it takes most of a year to raise one litter of kits.\nLifespan\nThe average lifespan for both male and female caracals is 12 years old in the wild. However, caracals kept in the zoo can live up to 17 years. Caracals live longer in a zoo environment because they are not threatened by predators, receive food on a regular basis and get medical care when they need it.\nAs a caracal ages in the wild, it can become ill from untreated skin infections and infections due to injuries. Also, like domestic cats, a caracal can get rabies from another animal and die. If a caracal happens to wander near a road, it\u2019s at risk for getting hit by a vehicle just as a domesticated cat is at risk if it wanders away from home.\nCaracal Population\nThe exact population of caracals in the world is not known. But, there is some data on these small cats:\n\u2022 Caracal populations are growing in South Africa and Namibia where there is plenty of prey available for them.\n\u2022 It\u2019s believed that the highest number of caracals live in the mountains of the Eastern Cape in South Africa.\n\u2022 In North Africa, the caracal population seems to be decreasing possibly due to hunters. The conservation status of caracals in North Africa is: Threatened.\n\u2022 The caracal population in Asia is decreasing likely due to farmers killing them when they try to hunt their livestock.\nView all 153 animals that start with C"}

Zebras on the African plains. Sea turtles in the ocean. Lizards in the desert. There are so many different kinds of animals all over the world! How are animals able to live in so many different kinds of places? The answer is adaptations. An adaptation is a characteristic that helps an animal survive in its habitat. All animals must be able to obtain food and water, protect themselves from harm, withstand the climate, and reproduce young so the species doesn't become extinct. So, any animal who successfully survives on land or in water has physical or behavioral adaptations that help it to accomplish those goals. An adaptation can be a body part, body covering, body function, or behavior that increases an animal's chances of survival in a particular place. Animals develop these adaptations over time to match the environment where they live. The process of natural selection means that animals with traits that help them survive are more likely to live and pass on those traits to their offspring. Those adaptations happen over long periods of time, as animals adapt to the conditions of the environment. It takes many generations for adaptations to develop. Although habitats provide food, water and shelter that animals need, there is more to survival than just the habitat. It is their own adaptations that allow animals to get food, stay safe, and reproduce within that specific habitat. Without their adaptations, the species could not thrive in that environment. Animals live everywhere on Earth. Some places on Earth are very hot and some are very cold. Some places have a lot of water and plants, and some have very little. Animals can live in many different places in the world because they have special adaptations for the area in which they live. For example, a monkey with agile limbs and a long tail for climbing is well adapted to the jungle, but would have a hard time in the cold, treeless polar regions. A shaggy, wooly musk ox is comfortable in the Arctic, but would not do well in a tropical climate. Adaptations are what allows such a diversity of animal species to live on Earth's land, seas and skies. Through adaptations, animals have found ways to inhabit every environment on earth! Let's take a look at some of the amazing adaptations animals have developed.\nPhysical Adaptations Physical adaptations include body parts, body coverings, and physiological characteristics that help animals survive, find food, and stay safe. Adaptation Facts for Kids: Kiddle Encyclopedia Body Parts The shape of a beak, the type of feet, the placement of eyes, the presence of whiskers, the shape of the nose or ears, and the sharpness of teeth are all examples of structural adaptations which help different animals to survive. As shown in the picture on the right, different kinds of birds have adapted different kinds of beaks that help them obtain their particular source of food. Beaks come in all shapes and sizes. For example, a hawk has a sharp, curved beak to tear its food into small pieces. A hummingbird has a long, thin beak to reach into flowers and get nectar. A parrot has a strong, thick beak to help it crack fruits and nuts. A pelican has a long beak with a pouch to help it scoop fish out of water. All kinds of body parts may be adaptations. Horses and zebras have flat teeth for grinding their food (grass), while lions have sharp teeth for tearing their food (meat.) To escape predators, zebras also have excellent hearing and eyesight and powerful legs for running and kicking. Birds have hollow bones that help them fly. Ducks have oil glands that keep their feathers from becoming water-soaked, and webbed feet that help them to swim. A woodpecker not only has a strong, sharp beak for drilling holes, but it also has a very long barbed tongue to catch insects, two toes that point backward to help with climbing trees, and a stiff tail for support on the tree. Alligators have eyes and nostrils placed on top of their heads, allowing them to keep most of their body underwater so their prey cannot see them. For river otters, whiskers are an adaptation that help them feel their way through tight spots both on land and in water. Badgers have sharp claws for digging burrows and tunnels and for obtaining food. Because they live underground, excellent vision is not an adaptation that they need; badgers and moles often have poor eyesight. Learn more about physical adaptations. Animals in the desert have special adaptations that help them conserve water and survive a habitat with extreme temperatures and lack of shelter. Camels have humps where they can store fat, allowing them to go without food and water for periods of time. Camels also have two rows of long, thick eyelashes to protect their eyes from blowing sand, and their nostrils can be closed as well. Their broad, leathery hooves act like snowshoes to prevent them from sinking in the sand. Other desert animals have different adaptations. Jackrabbits have large ears that keep them cool by spreading out their body heat. Fennec foxes have thick fur on the bottoms of their feet so they can walk on the hot desert ground. Learn more about desert adaptations. Adaptation Facts for Kids: Kiddle Encyclopedia In polar habitats, animals also have important adaptations that allow them to keep warm and survive extreme cold. For example, the penguin lives in the Antarctic and swims through icy cold water. Its feathers are tightly packed and layered like roof shingles. These special feathers keep cold water out and keep body heat in. The penguin's eyes have special lenses that allow it see both above and below the water. Its powerful wings help it swim through the water, and its feet help it steer as it swims. Being able to stay warm, see well, and swim quickly helps the penguin find food and avoid predators. In the Arctic, polar bears have webbed front paws that are shaped to propel them through the water. The bottoms of their feet are covered with hairy bumps that grip the ice and keep them from slipping, and a layer of blubber insulates them from the cold. Learn more about polar adaptations. Similar animals will often have different adaptations depending on where they live. For example, desert foxes have large ears for heat radiation, while Arctic foxes have small ears to retain body heat. Snowy owls have heavily feathered legs and feet, while elf owls, which live in warm, southern climates, have lightly feathered legs. Animals who live in the oceans have unique adaptations that allow them to move through water and defend themselves from marine predators. For example, sharks have streamlined bodies for fast swimming, and noses with special sensors that let them sense electric fields put out by other fish and animals. Stingrays swim along the ocean floor, with their eyes on top of their bodies and their mouth on the bottom, so they can see while they're swimming and still take in food they find in the sand. Lobsters use their claws to crush their food and their strong tails to move backward on the ocean floor. Harbor seals have four flippers to help them swim, with hind flippers to propel them forward and forward flippers to help them steer. Learn more about ocean adaptations. Some physical adaptations have more than one purpose. Horns and antlers may be used by animals to protect themselves, to fight with others for territory, or to attract a mate. A crab's hard shell protects it from predators, from drying out, and from being crushed by waves. Sometimes, multiple species have adaptations that suit each other. For example, pollinating insects are co-adapted with flowering plants, with body parts that are designed to work together. In Africa, oxpecker birds sit on the backs of zebras and pick off lice and bugs for food, which benefits both animals. Body Covering and Coloring Body coverings are an important adaptation for many animals. Mammals living in cold climates have thick fur to keep the heat in. Those living in warm climates have much thinner coats of hair or fur. For birds, feathers are an adaptation that serve several purposes: they keep birds warm in cold weather and cool when it's hot, allow them to fly, and help them attract mates. Reptiles are covered with scales that serve to protect their bodies from environmental conditions. Fish have overlapping scales that not only protect them from injuries, but also reduce water resistance when the fish is swimming. In addition, many fish are covered with a layer of slime which helps them move more quickly through the water. Another important adaption is known as camouflage. Many animals have colors or patterns that help them blend in with their habitat so they can successfully find food or hide from predators. Stripes and spots can help both predator and prey animals blend into their environment. Animals with spotted fur often live in forested areas. The jaguar's spots help it blend in with the small patches of sun that reach the shady rainforest floor, while the snow leopard, who lives in snowy, wooded mountains, has spotted fur that helps it hide among the trees and snow. Some green insects can look just like leaves on a tree. Brown rattlesnakes blend in with the rocks, soil and dry grass where they live. Bright-colored tropical fish can blend in with coral reefs. Cuttlefish and leaf frogs can change their appearance to match their surroundings. The chameleon is a lizard that can change its skin color for camouflage. The snowshoe hare's fur color shifts with the season: it is brown in the summer and white in the winter to blend in with the snow. Learn more about camouflage. Snowshoe Hare Leaf Insect Gecko Sometimes coloring is an adaptation with a different purpose than camouflage. For example, the male peacock's colorful tail display is used to attract a mate. Some poisonous frogs and butterflies have bright, vivid colors that make them stand out from their surroundings and serve as a warning to predators to stay away. Caterpillar mimicking a stick Owl butterfly For some animals, their appearance mimics a non-food object, or they resemble a harmful or distasteful animal that predators avoid. This adaptation to imitate something else to fool predators is called mimicry. For example, some butterflies have big spots that mimic the eyes of a large animal such as an owl. Some insects, such as the walking stick, resemble a twig, while the hawkmoth looks just like a tattered dead leaf. These disguises help them survive, as predators do not attack twigs or leaves. The nonpoisonous king snake has coloring that makes it look like the venomous coral snake, so predators leave the king snake alone. The harmless viceroy butterfly resembles the bitter-tasting monarch butterfly, so predators avoid the viceroy butterfly too. Harmless viceroy butterfly and Poisonous monarch\nHarmless milk snake and Poisonous coral snake\n(Mimicry Facts for Kids, Kiddle Encyclopedia)\nPhysiological Adaptations Physiological adaptions are different from body parts and coloring because they cannot be seen from an animal's outer appearance, but they are important adaptations within the animal's body. For example, many desert animals do not have sweat glands, which lets them retain moisture so they don't have to drink much. Some animals don't need to drink water at all, as they get all the water they need from the insects, plants and seeds that they eat. Some rodents have special kidneys that return water to the bloodstream instead of losing it through urination. Crocodiles have internal glands that get rid of the salt they consume when they swallow their saltwater prey. There are internal defensive adaptations such as snakes producing venom in their bodies, skunks producing bad-smelling spray, horned toads squirting blood from their eyes, and millipedes secreting toxins through their skin. Still other animals have bodies that secrete slime, like snails who use it to glide smoothly across the ground, or hagfish who choke their attackers with slime. Another adaptation is specially developed senses of hearing, smell, or sight that far surpass human abilities. For example, the African elephant has 2,000 scent receptors in its nose, compared to humans' 400 receptors. A peregrine falcon's eyesight is so acute that it can spot a mouse a mile away. Some animals utilize senses beyond the five senses humans have. These sensory adaptations include echolocation which allows bats to locate their prey by sending out sounds that bounce off other objects, and infrared detection, which allows snakes to sense heat radiation from prey species at night. Most adaptations do not operate singly, but rather work together to ensure the animal's survival. Most people know that the giraffe has a very long neck that helps it reach leaves in the tops of trees (a body-part adaptation), but what may be less obvious is the giraffe's extra-large heart that pumps blood up that long neck to reach its brain (a physiological adaptation.) In addition, it has a spotted coat for camouflage, an 18-inch tongue that can wrap around branches, and the ability to drink 12 gallons of water at once when it comes upon a scarce water hole. All of these adaptations, working together, help the giraffe succeed in its environment.\nBehavioral Adaptations Like physical adaptations, behavioral adaptations improve animals' chances for survival. These are inherited behaviors that animals don't have to learn. You may have heard these behaviors referred to as instinct. A bird building a nest or a lion preying on a zebra are examples of instinctive behaviors. One of the most important behavioral adaptations is living together in groups. These groups are often referred to as herds, families, colonies, flocks and packs, but there are many unique names for animal groups such as a pod of whales, a school of fish, or a pride of lions. These groups may consist of hundreds of animals or just a few. Living in groups allows animals to help each other find food, defend against predators and care for young. When many zebras stand or move together in a group, the abundance of stripes makes it more difficult for a lion to pick out and hunt one individual zebra. Although a fully grown bison is safe from most predators, bison live in herds and form circles to protect their young. Some predators such as wolves hunt as a group, working together to bring down larger prey. And many animals huddle together in cold weather to share body warmth. Another behavioral adaptation is migration. Migrating animals travel from one place to another depending on seasonal conditions. Migration is an adaptation that helps some animals cope with the climate and find places to obtain food and have their young. Birds, whales, bats and monarch butterflies are well-known for their annual migration between northern and southern regions. Some animals migrate a short distance from high mountains to lower valleys, while others cover large parts of the globe with their migration routes. For example, the Arctic tern travels 25,000 miles in its annual migration. Learn more about animal migration. Hibernation is another adaptation that allows some animals to successfully survive when weather conditions are harsh and resources are scarce. A hibernating animal goes to sleep or is dormant during cold weather. They remain safe by hiding in dens or burrows. Their heartbeat and breathing slow down. They do not have to use up energy looking for food because their bodies live off their stored fat or food. Bears, bats, chipmunks, frogs, and many other animals hibernate during the winter. Some animals are referred to as nocturnal, which mean they are active at night. For desert animals, this adaptation allows them to search for food when temperatures are cooler. Other animals burrow into the ground during the day to avoid the harsh conditions during the day. Many behavioral adaptations are defensive. These behaviors are designed to help animals protect themselves from danger. A blowfish (right) has the ability to puff up its body to twice its normal size to scare off attackers. Possums go stiff and \"play dead\" to make predators think they are not alive. The three-banded armadillo can curl itself into a ball where it is protected by its armor. A porcupine turns its quills toward a threatening intruder. A nesting killdeer will pretend to be injured to lure a predator away from her young. A rattlesnake has a unique adaptation: at the end of its tail it grows interlocking, hollow segments. When threatened, the snake coils into a circle and shakes its tail, warning intruders to stay away. Still other behavioral adaptations have the purpose of courtship. In order for the species to continue, animals must attract a mate and have young. The male sage grouse attracts a female by inflating his neck pouch and fanning his feathers. Some male penguins offer stones for nest-building as gifts to the females. The albatross performs an elaborate courtship ritual where he dances, leaps, sings, and points his beak to the sky. Male elk \"bugle\" to attract females and to announce dominance over other males. Not all animal behaviors are adaptations. A raccoon who repeatedly seeks food in a local trash can, a deer who stays away from a yard with motion-activated night lights, or a bird who avoids bad-tasting insects after eating one, are all exhibiting learned behaviors. These behaviors may help the animal survive, but they will not be passed on to the next generation.\nPrey, Predator, and Scavenger Some animals eat other animals (predators), some try to keep from being eaten (prey), and others clean up the remains of dead animals (scavengers.) Predators are not villains - like all organisms, including humans, they are getting the energy (food) they need to survive. Each creature is necessary to the cycle of life. All animals in a natural ecosystem have a different \"job\" or ecological niche, and all adaptations help organisms to be successful in their niches. Whether an animal is predator or prey, it must have necessary adaptations to live another day, or it will not survive. Many prey animals have developed a variety of adaptations to protect themselves from becoming a predator's dinner. In order to survive, prey animals rely on camouflage, warning signals, well-developed senses, weapon-like body parts, and defensive behaviors. Predators also have camouflage coloring and blend in with their surroundings, but for them the purpose is to hide when hunting prey. Other adaptations that make an animal a successful predator include body parts like sharp teeth, strong jaws or razor-like talons, physiological adaptations such as producing deadly venom, and behaviors like hunting in groups and stalking (sneaking up on) their prey. Even scavengers have special adaptations. They use their excellent sense of smell to find their food - dead animals. Why does a vulture have a featherless head? This bird often feeds by putting its head into the bodies of dead animals. After it eats, its bare skin is exposed to the sun's heat which kills harmful bacteria that might have rubbed off from the decaying meat. A clean head keeps a vulture healthy, so it can live another day. In addition, the digestive track of vultures has an adaptation that allows vultures to not get sick from any diseased animals that they eat. In all habitats, adaptations make the complex, interconnected food webs work.\nAdapting to Environmental Change Over time, environments can change and become drier, wetter, hotter, colder, darker or sunnier. Since adaptations develop to help animals survive in a specific habitat, what happens if the environment begins to change, and those adaptations no longer help the animal? If an animal's food source disappears, adaptations that help them find that food will no longer be useful. Sometimes even a small change in temperature or water quality can mean big problems for animals that have adapted to survive under certain conditions. Altered environments have meant extinction for some animals. When habitats change, in order to survive animals must either move to new areas, or respond to those changes through adaptations. For example, a species living in water that becomes more acidic might adapt by slowly shifting its own body chemistry. Dark and light colored peppered moths, Wikimedia Commons Adaptations may cause an increase or decrease in populations of animals with certain traits. An example of a changing adaptation is the case of the peppered moth. The peppered moth uses camouflage to blend in with the trees it perches on, in order to avoid being eaten by birds. About 200 years ago, light-colored peppered moths were common, while dark-colored peppered moths were rare. The lighter moths were more difficult for birds to see against the light-colored tree trunks and light-colored lichen on the trees, so they were more likely to survive. However, during the Industrial Revolution many forests became polluted with layers of black soot from the burning coal used in factories. Trees became darker, and the light-colored lichen was gone. The lighter moths stood out against the dark trees and became easy prey for birds. After the trees became darker, the dark-colored moths were better camouflaged and less likely to be eaten. They became more likely to survive and pass on their dark-colored genes to their young. Over time, the dark colored moths became the more common of the two color forms. Today, climate change and rising temperatures threaten many animals who are adapted to certain conditions. While some organisms may not survive in their usual habitats, it is possible that we will see changing adaptations in some species. One example is the colored feathers of the tawny owl. This owl comes in two colors, pale brown and gray. The gray color helps it to blend in with snowy trees to hide from predators. Due to rising temperatures, there has been less snowfall in some areas. Because of the decreased snow, there has been an increase in brown-feathered tawny owls in the past 40 years.\nPlant Adaptations Do plants have adaptations too? Yes! Just as with animals, plants must be adapted to their environment. And just as with animals, adaptations help plants survive the climate conditions, defend against predators, and reproduce. Tropical plants Arctic plants Plants make their own food using water and sunlight absorbed through their leaves. Many plants have special chemicals in their cells that help them grow toward sunlight, an adaptation known as phototropism. Another plant adaptation is leaf size. Since water usually escapes from plants through the leaves, plants that live in dry climates have thick stems and small leaves. The leaves may also be coated in wax that reduces water loss and prevents the plant from drying out. Plants in moist climates have big, wide leaves that absorb lots of sunlight. In windy, cold climates, plants are usually short with small leaves. Short plants are more protected from wind. More than 99 percent of Antarctica is covered with ice, but a few plants still grow close to the ground there, mostly lichens and mosses. Desert plants Some plants protect themselves from predators with leaves that contain poisonous oils that irritate or even kill an organism that tries to eat them. Other plants have thorns to keep predators away. In desert plants such as cacti, sharp spines and thick skin also protect the cactus's water store from predators. Like animals, plants must reproduce. This is done through seeds that need sunlight, water, and a place to grow. Special adaptations help seeds move to new areas where they can grow. Some trees have adapted so that heat from wildfire opens their seed cones and disperses the seeds. Some plants have seeds with hard coats that float down rivers or streams to take root somewhere else. There are plants that have seeds with hooks or barbs that attach to animals' fur to be carried away. Some seeds are heavy and fall down to the ground, while others have \"wings\" and are light enough to be carried long distances by the wind. Some plant adaptations can even help establish new habitats through seed dispersal. Learn more about plant adaptations.\nHow Do Humans Mimic Animal Adaptations? The most important human adaptation is our large brains which allow us to think and solve problems. Animal adaptions often give humans good ideas about surviving in different habitats. When humans develop ways to live more successfully based on observing animals, it is called biomimicry. How do animals give us ideas for staying dry on a rainy day? We wear slippery, water-resistant raincoats that makes rain run off like a duck's feathers do. How do people use the idea of a turtle's hard shell to keep safe? We put on bike helmets to protect our heads. How do animals give us ideas for moving through water? Divers use flippers like those of sea turtles to propel them in the water. How do animals give us ideas about staying warm when it is cold? Early humans in cold climates copied animal adaptations by wrapping themselves in furry animal skins to keep warm. To this day, people put on warm, thick coats in cold weather. Sleeping bags and jackets are often made of bird feathers for insulation. Baseball players put dark marks under their eyes, like a cheetah or a meerkat, to cut down on sun glare. Competitive swimmers use special swimsuits modeled after sharkskin. The sleek front ends of high-speed trains are based on the long, streamlined beak of the kingfisher bird. People can learn a lot from animal adaptations! Learn more about biomimicry."}

Most history books tend to gloss over the more gruesome details of what such fights entailed. For example, history books rarely tell you about . . .\n10 The Suicides\nSome people who fought against animals in the Colosseum were well-trained men and thought of it as a career. A great deal of them, however, were unarmed criminals or prisoners of war who were thrown to the animals with virtually nothing to defend themselves.\nAs you can imagine, such a fate was terrifying for even the most hardened of men. Many prisoners killed themselves with whatever they had on hand rather than risk being killed by whichever strange beasts lined up for the morning show.\nFor example, one German prisoner killed himself by forcing a sponge down his own throat. And not just any sponge\u2014this was a lavatory sponge that inmates used to wipe their anuses. Other stories involve prisoners making murder suicide pacts with each other, like the 29 Saxon prisoners who all fatally strangled one other to avoid death in the arena. How the last one alive managed to kill himself isn\u2019t recorded, but considering \u201cchoking on a sponge of human excrement\u201d was an option, we\u2019re guessing it wasn\u2019t pretty.\n9 The Fighting Killed Off Whole Species\nThe sheer quantity of slaughter in the Colosseum saw the number of lions, jaguars, and tigers plummet across the globe. According to some, Roman hunting absolutely \u201cdevastated the wildlife of North Africa and the entire Mediterranean region,\u201d wiping some species of animal off the map entirely.\nFor example, after one particularly brutal set of games in which 9,000 animals were slaughtered, the hippo disappeared from the river Nile. Creatures like the North African elephant, which was also commonly used as a war elephant during the time, were wiped of the face of the Earth completely.\n8 Few Bestiari Ever Survived\nBecause the majority of bestiari were prisoners of war or other such undesirables, they were almost always ill-equipped for the task of slaughtering a rampaging wild animal. In the highly unlikely event a bestiari actually managed to kill the animal he was forced to fight, another would almost certainly be let loose before he\u2019d even finished celebrating.\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Strabo once described the plight of a particularly unlucky bestiari who was first sentenced to be killed by a boar. When the boar accidentally fatally gored its handler, leaving the guards no choice but to kill it, a wild bear was brought in to the arena instead to kill the prisoner. In an unbelievable stroke of luck, the bear then refused to leave its cage, once again leaving the prisoner alive and the guards with the frustrating task of killing the bear. Not ones to be deterred, the Romans finally brought into the arena a caged leopard, which happily tore out the bestiari\u2019s throat.\nSome people just don\u2019t have any luck, do they?\n7 Commodus And The Ostriches\nEmperor Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator) took great pleasure in slaughtering animals and people in the arena. He enjoyed it so much that in one day alone, he reportedly killed more than 100 bears. Though we don\u2019t know exactly how Commodus managed such a feat, scholars agree he probably just stabbed them while they stood tethered and helpless.\nThough such actions paint Commodus as a poor fighter, he was reportedly a crack shot with the bow, which he liked to prove by decapitating ostriches in full sprint with crescent-shaped arrows. Commodus would then brandish or even throw the decapitated heads at members of the crowd or his own senate, either as a warning or a sign of his madness.\n6 Elephants Crushed Deserters\nDamnatio ad bestias (\u201ccondemnation by wild beasts\u201d) was the act of condemning criminals to death by animal attack in the arena. Unlike the betiarii, who stood at least a small chance at defending themselves, those condemned via damnatio ad bestias were either defenseless, tied to the spot, or just naked and armed with a wooden weapon.\nThe very first case of damnatio ad bestias in Roman history occurred when Aemilius Paullus sentenced a group of army deserters to death in 167 BC. To make it interesting, he ordered them crushed to death by a horde of elephants. The spectacle proved so popular that death by animals became a part of everyday life for the Romans\u2014literally. Every morning, a Roman citizen could go to the arena to watch such executions take place before an afternoon of actual gladiatorial combat.\n5 Public Hunts\nThe killing of animals was usually left to trained professionals or unarmed prisoners. But on rare occasions, the general public got the chance to kill rare and exotic animals for their own enjoyment.\nEmperor Probus turned one of the most famous chariot racetracks in Rome, the Circus Maximus, into an actual forest around 280 AD. Into this forest, he released hundreds, if not thousands, of ibexes, sheep, ostriches, and other beasts.\nAfter the forest had been suitably filled with hapless herbivores, the public was then permitted to enter and hunt animals for fun. As a bonus, they could keep anything they killed. The following day, Probus had 400 lions and 300 bears stabbed to death, because the public apparently still wasn\u2019t satisfied with all the free ostrich meat they\u2019d received the day before.\n4 Orpheus Against The Bears\nAccording to legend, the hero Orpheus was a musician of such skill that he could charm all living things with nothing more than a lyre. The Romans loved this legend and tried to recreate it many, many times. They\u2019d dress a condemned criminal up like Orpheus, give him a lyre, and then throw him into an arena full of angry bears, normally ones that had been starved or beaten.\nSometimes, though, the Romans would put a further twist on the myth and crucify the man playing Orpheus before exposing him to the bear. Mostly, however, the Romans were a little more sporting and the criminal was free to defend himself with the lyre he\u2019d been given. This went about as well as you\u2019d expect. Then again, it could have been worse . . .\n3 Carpophorus\u2019s Rape Giraffes\nBesides the bestiari, arena competitors included better-trained, voluntary fighters called \u201cvenatores.\u201d Carpophorus is likely the most famous of them all. He once killed 20 wild beasts in a single day, straight-up strangling some of them to death.\nHowever, Carpophorus had another talent that we want to discuss today. Along with being an expert killer of animals, he was also a rather skilled trainer of them. Carpophorus trained multiple animals, including giraffes, to rape women. To accomplish this, Carpophorus would wait for female animals to be in heat so he could collect samples from them to arouse the male of the species. Carpophorus would then rub these samples against slaves or homeless women he\u2019d tempted to the arena. According to one account, \u201cCarpophorus used up several women before he got the animals properly trained.\u201d\nThe reasoning behind such madness was, like with the sad case of prisoners forced to dress as Orpheus, to reenact Greek or Roman myths. In particular, these involved Zeus, who liked to take the form of various animals before having his way with women.\nOne story involves a woman accused of poisoning five being raped by a jackass, before Carpophorus ended the ordeal by releasing wild animals into the arena to ease her suffering.\n2 Prolific Killer Animals\nIf you hadn\u2019t already guessed by now, the Romans didn\u2019t exactly take good care of the animals they intended to fight or kill. Most animals, to save on the cost of housing and feeding them, would be killed outright after each games, since, well, replacements were easy to come by. However, exceptions existed.\nAccording to the famed Roman philosopher Cicero, one lion in the arena killed an astounding 200 men before it was finally slain. Other notable animals include the group of 18 elephants who stormed the crowd in an escape attempt. The elephants were originally to be killed by a group of men armed with darts, but they smashed through the fence separating them from the crowd. To stop this from ever happening again, the Romans placed a large trench between the arena and the crowd for future events.\n1 No Animals Had To Die\nPerhaps the most cruel aspect of all is that the animals brought to the arena never really needed to be killed. We don\u2019t mean that killing animals for sport is wrong\u2014the Romans had little patience for that argument. We mean that the animals proved perfectly capable of entertaining the crowds while staying alive.\nFor example, trained elephants who danced, bowed, and did other tricks delighted the crowds. In fact, elephants were noted as being one of the only creatures the crowds didn\u2019t like to see being killed. Writers of the era note that spectators would boo upon seeing elephants killed, thinking them smart and gentle creatures.\nOther stories tell of the crowd being in awe of just seeing crocodiles sit in a ditch full of water. That\u2019s it\u2014no one stabbed them, and they didn\u2019t fight anything. People were happy just to look at them, as though in a zoo. Another time, a crowd of thousands once sat and laughed their heads off at the sight of a bunch of leopards running in a straight line.\nThe crowd was literally just as happy to see the animals run in a circle or sit and do nothing, but the Romana decided to kill them anyway to spice things up.\nKarl loves him some history and has been writing an ongoing series about ass-kicking athletes, found here. He also has a Twitter account, because of course he does."}

When Ingonyama (Swazi) or Nghala (Shangaan) announces his presence with a deep roar that reverberates through the dark bush, everything within a five-kilometre radius pauses to take note.\nA thousand years ago, they roamed as far afield as southern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, but they are now found mainly in Africa and are generally restricted to the bigger game reserves.\nLions have always had an association with royalty and leadership. Their power is reflected in their impressive size and the fact that their lifestyles allow them to sleep a lot - up to 18 hours a day. They are awesome animals, with males weighing up to 225kg and females up to 150kg. The lion's average lifespan in the bush is probably around 15 years.\nLions are the biggest, and most social, of the African cats, living communally in prides. Pride leadership often shifts between several individual animals - male and female - but the social structure of the pride hinges around the bond between related lionesses, who collaborate in all tasks, from raising cubs to hunting.\nMale lions come and go - often in spectacular battles over territory or individual dominance - but the pride cohesion remains unaffected, firmly under female control.\nLions favour open woodlands and thick scrub, the type of landscape that allows them to get as close to their prey as possible without being seen. In Kruger, the best chance of lion sightings is where the big game herds are.\nWhen do Lions hunt?\nAs a rule, lions hunt mostly at night and rest during the day but are often active at dawn and dusk and on cooler days. During the day they rest in thorn thickets, often near water holes.\nHow Often Does a Lion Hunt?\nHow often do Lions eat?\nLions are believed to feed every three or four days, and need on average between 5kg and 7kg of meat a day.\nHow long can a Lion go without eating?\nLions can go without food for more than a week and then tear into prey, eating up to 50kg of meat at a time - that's almost a quarter of the animal's body weight.\nHow do lions hunt?\nLions hunt either collaboratively or by themselves. Collaborative hunting usually involves the males approaching the intended prey upwind with the intention of driving it towards lionesses hiding in the bush downwind. Lions are not as fast as most of their prey so they rely heavily on the element of surprise when hunting.\nThey will attempt to get to within 30m of their prey before charging. They don't have the inclination for a long chase and will not pursue their prey very far if the first attack fails.\nHow do Lions kill their prey?\nIn a successful hunt, the prey is knocked off balance, dragged down and then killed with a bite to the back of the neck or the throat. In some cases, a kill can be a bloody, drawn out procedure. Buffalo have been known to fend off lion attacks for hours before succumbing to loss of blood and energy. The strongest male lion will eat first, followed by other members of the pride. Lionesses will feed themselves first, with cubs getting the scraps.\nEver wondered what animal can kill a lion? Lions sometimes become the victims of their intended prey. There have been instances in which lions have been killed by giraffe, buffalo, kudu, snakes and even porcupines.\nWhat Do Lions Eat?\nWhat does a Lion eat?\nThe short answer is quite a lot. In Kruger, lions have a broad diet with 37 animal species on the menu, including ostriches, quelea nestlings, tortoises and small crocodiles. Their preference is for buffalo, giraffe, zebra and wildebeest among the bigger animals, and porcupine and warthog as smaller game.\nNatural history artist Charles Astley Maberly - who rode through the Park on his bicycle sketching the wildlife in the 1920s - said that, in his experience, lions had a particular preference for waterbuck. This was confirmed by a 1960s study by former Kruger Chief Ranger Tol Pienaar who measured the kill rate of lions in the Park against the relative abundance of particular prey.\nWhat Do Lions Hunt?\nHe found that, although lion killed relatively few giraffe, giraffe meat accounted for almost a third of the average lion's diet. His study also found that, contrary to popular belief, lions are not so fond of impala.\nKruger researchers suggest male and female lions may also have different prey preferences, with males being more disposed towards hunting buffalo, while lionesses prefer zebra or wildebeest.\nAnother lion fact not commonly appreciated is that lions are not just hunters, but scavengers as well, often chasing smaller predators - like cheetah - off their kills. In some instances, up to 50% of a lion's diet can come from scavenging rather than hunting live prey.\nLions on a Killing Spree\nDuring periods of drought, lions sometimes go on a killing spree when they come across herds of weak animals. During the particularly bad drought of 1964, a pride of lions killed 15 buffalo near Punda Maria - far more than they could have eaten.\nThe territorial behaviour of lions is complicated because prides split up and re-unite, and hunting grounds shift as the seasons change and the game moves around. At any one time, a pride's territory in Kruger measures approximately 10 square kilometres. Territories may be defended vigorously by both males and females, but there are instances when prides share the same overlapping hunting zone yet deliberately avoid confrontation.\nClashes occur between prides when game migrations force lions to move beyond their territories in search of food, or when nomadic males challenge pride hierarchies. Fights can take the form of symbolic aggression displays and/or ferocious physical clashes that often result in the death of one or more participants.\nIf the challengers win, the defeated males are expelled and, in turn, become nomads themselves. The lionesses accept the new regime. Usually the conquering males kill all the cubs of the conquered pride. Within days of this infanticide the females come into oestrus and are ready to raise a new litter of the conquerer's cubs.\nScientists believe that territorial challenges are good for the survival of the species - they ensure diversity in the gene pool and dominance of the strongest genetic characteristics.\nLion Cubs\nLionesses typically give birth to litters of between two and four cubs. They are kept hidden in the bush for about six weeks. During this time, the lioness hunts exclusively for her cubs. Males provide no help. By the time they are two years old, cubs will have learnt to hunt for themselves.\nAt this time, male cubs are expelled from the pride while females are nurtured within it. These young males often form groupings of nomadic bachelors and either find new territories or challenge males in existing prides, and so the cyclical struggle for dominance goes on.\nHow Do Lions Attack Their Prey?\nLions hunt either alone or in prides. In collaborative hunts, it is usually the lioness who initiates the kill. Lions stalk their prey and, when close enough, attempt a short charge on their prey, trying either to pounce on their target or knock it over.\nHow does a Lion kill its prey? Lions kill their prey by breaking its neck or suffocating it by clamping their jaws around its throat.\nThe stomach is usually the easiest point of entry into the carcass, and this is the route most often taken by lions. It also gives them direct access to some of the most nutritious parts of the body, such as the kidneys and liver of the prey. Lions usually rest after an initial feed, lying a short way away from the carcass so that they can still defend their kill against scavengers.\nRead more about Kruger's Big Predators\nMore African Lion Facts Did you know that Lionesses often synchronize their breeding, enabling all the mothers in the pride to mutually suckle each others cubs.? Learn more about the African Lion and its behaviour, appearance, breeding and diet.\nIn a short time vultures are certain to begin to arrive. The first are usually the white-backed vultures and then come the lappet-faced and others. Scavengers like hyaenas and jackals will be attracted by the vulture activity and will patiently wait at a safe distance until the lions have had their fill. It can take over 24 hours before lions abandon their carcass and spectacular fights may occur among scavengers for the last scraps of food."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Cougar - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar", "text": "Large species of the family Felidae native to the Americas\nThe cougar (Puma concolor) is a large cat native to the Americas. Its range spans from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America and is the most widespread of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. It is an adaptable, generalist species, occurring in most American habitat types. Due to its wide range, it has many names, including puma, mountain lion, catamount and panther.\nThe cougar is the second-largest cat in the New World, after the jaguar (Panthera onca). Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. Despite its size, the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (Felis catus) than to any species of the subfamily Pantherinae.\nThe cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources are ungulates, particularly deer, but it also hunts smaller prey such as rodents. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but also lives in open areas. The cougar is territorial and lives at low population densities. Individual home ranges depend on terrain, vegetation and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the apex predator in its range, yielding prey it has killed to American black bears, grizzly bears and packs of wolves. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare, but increased in North America as more people entered cougar habitat and built farms.\nIntensive hunting following European colonization of the Americas and ongoing human development into cougar habitat has caused the cougar populations to drop in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the eastern cougar population is considered to have been mostly extirpated in eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, with the exception of the isolated Florida panther subpopulation.\nNaming and etymology\nThe word cougar is borrowed from the Portuguese \u00e7u\u00e7uarana, via French; it was originally derived from the Tupi language. A current form in Brazil is su\u00e7uarana. In the 17th century, Georg Marcgrave named it cuguacu ara. Marcgrave's rendering was reproduced in 1648 by his associate Willem Piso. Cuguacu ara was then adopted by John Ray in 1693. In 1774, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon converted cuguacu ara to cuguar, which was later modified to \"cougar\" in English.\nThe cougar holds the Guinness record for the animal with the greatest number of names, with over 40 in English alone. \"Puma\" is the common name used in Latin America and most parts of Europe. The term puma is also sometimes used in the United States. The first use of puma in English dates to 1777, introduced from Spanish from the Quechua language. In the western United States and Canada, it is also called \"mountain lion\", a name first used in writing in 1858. Other names include \"panther\" and \"catamount\" (meaning \"cat of the mountains\").\nTaxonomy and evolution\nFelis concolor was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1771 for a cat with a long tail from Brazil. The second half of the name, \"concolor\" is Latin for \"of uniform color\". It was placed in the genus Puma by William Jardine in 1834. This genus is part of the Felinae. The cougar is most closely related to the jaguarundi and the cheetah.\nSubspecies\nFollowing Linnaeus' first scientific description of the cougar, 32 cougar zoological specimens were described and proposed as subspecies until the late 1980s. Genetic analysis of cougar mitochondrial DNA indicate that many of these are too similar to be recognized as distinct at a molecular level, but that only six phylogeographic groups exist. The Florida panther samples showed a low microsatellite variation, possibly due to inbreeding. Following this research, the authors of Mammal Species of the World recognized the following six subspecies in 2005:\nP. c. concolor (Linnaeus, 1771) includes the synonyms bangsi , incarum , osgoodi , soasoaranna , sussuarana , soderstromii , su\u00e7ua\u00e7uara , and wavula\nincludes the synonyms , , , , , , , and P. c. puma Molina , 1782) araucanus , concolor , patagonica , pearsoni , and puma Trouessart , 1904)\n, , , , and P. c. couguar Kerr , 1792) arundivaga , aztecus , browni , californica , floridana , hippolestes , improcera , kaibabensis , mayensis , missoulensis , olympus , oregonensis , schorgeri , stanleyana , vancouverensis , and youngi\n, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and P. c. costaricensis Merriam , 1901)\nP. c. anthonyi Nelson and Goldman , 1931) acrocodia , borbensis , capricornensis , concolor , greeni , and nigra\n, , , , , and P. c. cabrerae Pocock , 1940 hudsonii and puma proposed by Marcelli in 1922\nIn 2006, the Florida panther was still referred to as a distinct subspecies P. c. coryi in research works.\nAs of 2017 , the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognizes only two subspecies as valid:\nP. c. concolor in South America, possibly excluding the region northwest of the Andes\nin South America, possibly excluding the region northwest of the Andes P. c. couguar in North and Central America and possibly northwestern South America\nEvolution\nLynx lineage Lynx Puma lineage Acinonyx Cheetah A. jubatus Puma Cougar Herpailurus Jaguarundi H. yagouaroundi Domestic cat lineage Felis Leopard cat lineage Otocolobus Prionailurus The Puma lineage of the family Felidae, depicted along with closely related genera\nThe family Felidae is believed to have originated in Asia about 11 million years ago. Taxonomic research on felids remains partial, and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on mitochondrial DNA analysis. Significant confidence intervals exist with suggested dates. In the latest genomic study of the Felidae, the common ancestor of today's Leopardus, Lynx, Puma, Prionailurus, and Felis lineages migrated across the Bering land bridge into the Americas 8.0 to 8.5 million years ago (Mya). The lineages subsequently diverged in that order. North American felids then invaded South America 2\u20134 Mya as part of the Great American Interchange, following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.\nThe cheetah lineage is suggested by some studies to have diverged from the Puma lineage in the Americas and migrated back to Asia and Africa, while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the Old World itself. A high level of genetic similarity has been found among North American cougar populations, suggesting they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group. Culver et al. propose the original North American cougar population was extirpated during the Pleistocene extinctions some 10,000 years ago, when other large mammals, such as Smilodon, also disappeared. North America was then repopulated by South American cougars.\nA coprolite identified as from a cougar was excavated in Argentina's Catamarca Province and dated to 17,002\u201316,573 years old. It contained Toxascaris leonina eggs. This finding indicates that the cougar and the parasite existed in South America since at least the Late Pleistocene.\nCharacteristics\nCougar skull and jawbone Front paw print of a cougar\nThe head of the cougar is round and the ears are erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has four retractile claws on its hind paws and five on its forepaws, of which one is a dewclaw. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations for clutching prey.\nCougars are slender and agile members of the Felidae. They are the fourth largest cat species worldwide; adults stand about 60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in) tall at the shoulders. Adult males are around 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) long from nose to tail tip, and females average 2.05 m (6 ft 9 in), with overall ranges between 1.50 to 2.75 m (4 ft 11 in to 9 ft 0 in) nose to tail suggested for the species in general. Of this length, the tail typically accounts for 63 to 95 cm (25 to 37 in). Males generally weigh 53 to 100 kg (117 to 220 lb), averaging 68 kg (150 lb). Females typically weigh between 29 and 64 kg (64 and 141 lb), averaging 55 kg (121 lb). Cougar size is smallest close to the equator and larger towards the poles. The largest recorded cougar, shot in 1901, weighed 105.2 kg (232 lb); claims of 125.2 kg (276 lb) and 118 kg (260 lb) have been reported, though they were probably exaggerated. On average, adult male cougars in British Columbia weigh 56.7 kg (125 lb) and adult females 45.4 kg (100 lb), though several male cougars in British Columbia weighed between 86.4 and 95.5 kg (190 and 211 lb).\nDepending on the locality, cougars can be smaller or bigger than jaguars, but are less muscular and not as powerfully built, so their weight is, on average, less. Whereas cougars tend to be larger as distance increases from the equator, which crosses the northern portion of South America, jaguars are generally smaller north of the Amazon River in South America and larger south of it. For example, while South American jaguars are comparatively large, and may exceed 90 kg (200 lb), North American jaguars in Mexico's Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve weigh approximately 50 kg (110 lb), about the same as female cougars.\nCougar coloring is plain (hence the Latin concolor [\"one color\"] in the scientific name), but can vary greatly across individuals, and even siblings. The coat is typically tawny, but it otherwise ranges from silvery-grey or reddish with lighter patches on the underbody, including the jaws, chin, and throat. Infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails; juveniles are pale and dark spots remain on their flanks. A leucistic individual was seen in Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park in Rio de Janeiro in 2013 when it was recorded by a camera trap, indicating that extremely rare, pure white individual cougars do exist in the species.\nThe cougar has large paws and proportionally the largest hind legs in the Felidae, allowing for its great leaping and short-sprint ability. It is capable of leaping from the ground up to 5.5 m (18 ft) high into a tree.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe cougar has the largest range of any wild land animal in the Americas, spanning 110 degrees of latitude from the Yukon Territory in Canada to the southern Andes in Chile. The species was extricated from eastern North America, aside from Florida, but they may be recolonizing their former range and isolated populations have been documented east of their contemporary ranges in both the US and Canada.\nThe cougar lives in all forest types, lowland and mountainous deserts and in open areas with little vegetation up to an elevation of 5,800 m (19,000 ft). In the Santa Ana Mountains, it prefers steep canyons, escarpments, rim rocks and dense brush. In Mexico, it was recorded in the Sierra de San Carlos. In the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, it inhabits secondary and semi-deciduous forests in El Eden Ecological Reserve. In El Salvador, it was recorded in lower montane forest in Montecristo National Park and in a river basin in the Moraz\u00e1n Department above 700 m (2,300 ft) in 2019. In Colombia, it was recorded in a palm oil plantation close to a riparian forest in the Llanos Basin, and close to water bodies in the Magdalena River Valley. In the human-modified landscape of central Argentina, it inhabits bushland with abundant vegetation cover and prey species.\nBehavior and ecology\nCougars are important keystone species in Western Hemisphere ecosystems, linking numerous different species at many trophic levels. In a comprehensive literature review of more than 160 studies on cougar ecology, ecological interactions with 485 other species in cougar-inhabited ecosystems have been shown to involve different areas of interaction, ranging from the use of other species as food sources and prey, fear effects on potential prey, effects from carcass remains left behind, to competitive effects on other predator species in shared habitat. The most common research topic in the literature used here was the diet of the cougar and the regulation of its prey.\nHunting and diet\nCougar with deer kill\nThe cougar is a generalist, hypercarnivore. They prefer large mammals such as mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, moose, mountain goat and bighorn sheep. They will opportunistically take smaller prey such as rodents, lagomorphs, smaller carnivores, birds and even domestic animals including pets. The mean weight of cougar vertebrate prey increases with its body weight and is lower in areas closer to the equator. A survey of North America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer. Only the Florida panther showed variation, often preferring feral hogs and armadillos.\nInvestigations at Yellowstone National Park showed that elk, followed by mule deer, were the cougar's primary targets; the prey base is shared with the park's wolves, with which the cougar competes for resources. A study on winter kills from November to April in Alberta showed that ungulates accounted for greater than 99% of the cougar diet. Learned, individual prey recognition was observed, as some cougars rarely killed bighorn sheep, while others relied heavily on the species.\nIn the Central and South American cougar range, the ratio of deer in the diet declines. Small to mid-sized mammals are preferred, including large rodents such as the capybara. Ungulates accounted for only 35% of prey items in one survey, about half that of North America. Competition with the larger jaguar in South America has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items. However, a study by Guti\u00e9rrez-Gonz\u00e1lez and L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez showed that the cougar and jaguar in Central or North America may share the same prey, depending on its abundance. Other listed prey species of the cougar include mice, porcupines, beavers, raccoons, hares, guanacoes, peccaries, vicuna, rheas, and wild turkeys. Birds and small reptiles are sometimes preyed upon in the south, but this is rarely recorded in North America. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) constitute the majority of prey items in cougar diet in Patagonia's Bosques Petrificados de Jaramillo National Park and Monte Le\u00f3n National Park.\nAlthough capable of sprinting, the cougar is typically an ambush predator. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground. Kills are generally estimated around one large ungulate every two weeks. The period shrinks for females raising young, and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature around 15 months. The cat drags a kill to a preferred spot, covers it with brush, and returns to feed over a period of days. The cougar is generally reported to not be a scavenger, but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in California, suggesting more opportunistic behavior.\nInteractions with other predators\nAside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild, although conflicts with other predators or scavengers occur. Of the large predators in Yellowstone National Park \u2013 the grizzly bear, the black bear, the gray wolf, and the cougar \u2013 the massive grizzly bear appears dominant, often (but not always) able to drive a gray wolf pack, an American black bear, and a cougar off their kills. One study found that grizzlies and American black bears visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of carcasses. Bears gained up to 113% and cougars lost up to 26% of their respective daily energy requirements from these encounters. In Colorado and California, American black bears were found to visit 48% and 77% of kills, respectively. In general, cougars are subordinate to American black bears when it comes to kills and when bears are most active, the cats take prey more frequently and spend less time feeding on each kill. Unlike several subordinate predators from other ecosystems, cougars do not appear to take advantage of spatial or temporal refuges to avoid their competitors.\nThe gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey, mostly in winter. Packs of wolves can steal cougars' kills, and there are some documented cases of cougars being killed by them. One report describes a large pack of seven to 11 wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens, while in nearby Sun Valley, Idaho, a 2-year-old male cougar was found dead, apparently killed by a wolf pack. Conversely, one-to-one confrontations tend to be dominated by the cat, and there are various documented accounts where wolves have been ambushed and killed, including adult male specimens. Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities, and disrupting the feline's behavior. Preliminary research in Yellowstone, for instance, has shown displacement of the cougar by wolves. One researcher in Oregon noted: \"When there is a pack around, cougars are not comfortable around their kills or raising kittens [...] A lot of times a big cougar will kill a wolf, but the pack phenomenon changes the table.\" Both species are capable of killing mid-sized predators, such as bobcats, Canada lynxes, wolverines and coyotes, and tend to suppress their numbers. Although cougars can kill coyotes, the latter have been documented attempting to prey on cougar cubs.\nIn the southern portion of its range, the cougar and jaguar share overlapping territory. The jaguar tends to take the larger prey where ranges overlap, reducing both the cougar's potential size and the likelihood of direct competition between the two cats. Cougars appear better than jaguars at exploiting a broader prey niche and smaller prey.\nSocial spacing and interactions\nLike almost all cats, the cougar is a mostly solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting rarely. While generally loners, cougars will reciprocally share kills with one another and seem to organize themselves into small communities defined by the territories of dominant males. Cats within these areas socialize more frequently with each other than with outsiders. Other research suggests a much smaller lower limit of 25 km2 (9.7 sq mi), but an even greater upper limit of 1,300 km2 (500 sq mi) for males. Male home ranges include or overlap with those of females but, at least where studied, not with those of other males. Home ranges of females overlap slightly. Males create scrapes composed of leaves and duff with their hind feet, and mark them with urine and sometimes feces.\nHome range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain, vegetation, and prey abundance. Estimates of home range sizes for cougars vary greatly. Large male home ranges of 150 to 1,000 km2 (58 to 386 sq mi) with female ranges half that size. One female adjacent to the San Andres Mountains was found with a large range of 215 km2 (83 sq mi), necessitated by poor prey abundance. Research has shown cougar abundances from 0.5 animals to as many as seven per 100 km2 (39 sq mi). When males encounter each other, they vocalize and may engage in violent conflict if neither backs down.\nCougars communicate with various vocalizations. Aggressive sounds include growls, spits, snarls and hisses. During the mating season, estrus females produce caterwauls or yowls to attract mates and males respond with similar vocals. Mothers and offspring keep in contact with whistles, chirps and mews.\nReproduction and life cycle\nFemales reach sexual maturity at the age of 18 months to three years and are in estrus for about eight days of a 23-day cycle; the gestation period is approximately 91 days. Both adult males and females may mate with multiple partners and a female's litter can have multiple paternities. Copulation is brief but frequent. Chronic stress can result in low reproductive rates in captivity as well as in the field.\nGestation is 82\u2013103 days long. Only females are involved in parenting. Litter size is between one and six cubs; typically two. Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens. Born blind, cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first, and begin to be weaned at around three months of age. As they grow, they begin to go out on forays with their mother, first visiting kill sites, and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own. Kitten survival rates are just over one per litter.\nJuveniles remain with their mothers for one to two years. When the females reaches estrous again, their offspring must disperse or the male will kill them. Males tend to disperse further than females. One study has shown a high mortality rate amongst cougars that travel farthest from their maternal range, often due to conflicts with other cougars. In a study area in New Mexico, males dispersed farther than females, traversed large expanses of non-cougar habitat and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches.\nLife expectancy in the wild is reported at 8 to 13 years, and probably averages 8 to 10; a female of at least 18 years was reported killed by hunters on Vancouver Island. Cougars may live as long as 20 years in captivity. Causes of death in the wild include disability and disease, competition with other cougars, starvation, accidents, and, where allowed, hunting. The feline immunodeficiency virus is well-adapted to the cougar.\nConservation\nThe cougar has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2008 and is also listed on CITES Appendix II. Hunting it is prohibited in California, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Suriname, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and most of Argentina. Hunting is regulated in Canada, Mexico, Peru and the United States. Establishing wildlife corridors and protecting sufficient range areas are critical for the sustainability of cougar populations. Research simulations showed that it faces a low extinction risk in areas, which are larger than 2,200 km2 (850 sq mi). Between one and four new individuals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence, thus highlighting the importance of habitat corridors.\nThe Florida panther population is afforded protection under the Endangered Species Act. The Texas Mountain Lion Conservation Project was launched in 2009 and aimed at raising awareness of local people about the status and ecological role of the cougar, and mitigating conflict between landowners and cougars.\nThe cougar is threatened by habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and depletion of its prey base due to poaching. Hunting is legal in western United States, and it is threatened in Florida by heavy traffic, which causes frequent fatal accidents involving cougars. Highways are a major barrier for dispersal of cougars. The cougar populations in California are becoming fragmented with the increase of human population and infrastructure growth in the state.\nHuman\u2013wildlife conflict in proximity of 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) of cougar habitat is pronounced in areas with a median human density of 32.48 inhabitants/km2 (84.1 inhabitants/sq mi) and a median livestock population density of 5.3 heads/km2 (14 heads/sq mi). Conflict is generally lower in areas more than 16.1 km (10.0 mi) away from roads and 27.8 km (17.3 mi) away from settlements.\nRelationships with humans\nAttacks on humans\nIn North America\nMountain lion warning sign in California , U.S.\nDue to the expanding human population, cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans. Attacks on humans are very rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey. In a 10-year study in New Mexico of wild cougars who were not habituated to humans, the animals did not exhibit threatening behavior to researchers who approached closely (median distance=18.5 m; 61 feet) except in 6% of cases; 14/16 of those were females with cubs. Attacks on people, livestock, and pets may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer, when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory.\nBetween 1890 and 1990 in North America there were 53 reported, confirmed attacks on humans, resulting in 48 nonfatal injuries and 10 deaths of humans (the total is greater than 53 because some attacks had more than one victim). By 2004, the count had climbed to 88 attacks and 20 deaths.\nWithin North America, the distribution of attacks is not uniform. The heavily populated state of California saw a dozen attacks 1986 to 2004 (after just three from 1890 to 1985), including three fatalities. Washington state was the site of a fatal attack in 2018, its first since 1924. Lightly populated New Mexico reported an attack in 2008, the first there since 1974.\nAs with many predators, a cougar may attack if cornered, if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase, or if a person \"plays dead\". Standing still may cause the cougar to consider a person easy prey. Exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact, loud shouting, and any other action to appear larger and more menacing, may make the animal retreat. Fighting back with sticks and rocks, or even bare hands, is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengage.\nWhen cougars do attack, they usually employ their characteristic neck bite, attempting to position their teeth between the vertebrae and into the spinal cord. Neck, head, and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal. Children are at greatest risk of attack, and least likely to survive an encounter. Detailed research into attacks prior to 1991 showed that 64% of all victims \u2013 and almost all fatalities \u2013 were children. The same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in British Columbia, particularly on Vancouver Island where cougar populations are especially dense. Preceding attacks on humans, cougars display aberrant behavior, such as activity during daylight hours, a lack of fear of humans, and stalking humans. There have sometimes been incidents of pet cougars mauling people.\nResearch on new wildlife collars may be able to reduce human-animal conflicts by predicting when and where predatory animals hunt. This may save the lives of humans, pets, and livestock as well as the lives of these large predatory mammals that are important to the balance of ecosystems.\nIn South America\nPumas in the southern cone of America \u2013 often called Argentine cougars by North Americans \u2013 are reputed to be extremely reluctant to attack man; in legend, they defended people against jaguars. The nineteenth century naturalists F\u00e9lix de Azara and William Henry Hudson thought that attacks on people, even children or sleeping adults, did not happen. Hudson, citing anecdotal evidence from hunters, claimed that pumas were positively inhibited from attacking people, even in self-defense. In fact, attacks on humans, although exceedingly rare, have occurred.\nAn early, authenticated, non-fatal case occurred near Lake Viedma, Patagonia in 1877 when a female mauled the Argentine scientist Francisco P. Moreno; Moreno afterwards showed the scars to Theodore Roosevelt. In this instance, however, Moreno had been wearing a guanaco-hide poncho round his neck and head as protection against the cold; in Patagonia the guanaco is the puma's chief prey animal. Another authenticated case occurred In 1997 in Iguaz\u00fa National Park in northeastern Argentina, when the 20-month son of a ranger was killed by a female puma. Forensic analysis found specimens of the child's hair and clothing fibers in the animal's stomach. In this area the coat\u00ed is the puma's chief prey. Despite prohibitory signs, coatis are hand-fed by tourists in the park, causing unnatural approximation between cougars and humans. This particular puma had been raised in captivity and released into the wild. On 13 March 2012, Erica Cruz, a 23-year old shepherdess was found dead in a mountainous area near Rosario de Lerma, Salta Province, in northwestern Argentina. Claw incisions, which severed a jugular vein, indicated that the attacker was a felid; differential diagnosis ruled out other possible perpetrators.[b] There were no bite marks on the victim, who had been herding goats. In 2019 in C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina an elderly man was badly injured by a cougar after he attempted to defend his dog from it, while in neighbouring Chile a 28-year-old woman was attacked and killed in Corral, in Los R\u00edos Region, on 20 October 2020.\nFatal attacks by other carnivores such as feral dogs can be misattributed to cougars without appropriate forensic knowledge.\nPredation on domestic animals\nThe Cougar Hunt, a 1920s silent film created by the , a 1920s silent film created by the United States Department of Agriculture which explains the procedures to successfully hunt livestock-threatening cougars\nDuring the early years of ranching, cougars were considered on par with wolves in destructiveness. According to figures in Texas in 1990, 86 calves (0.0006% of Texas' 13.4 million cattle and calves), 253 mohair goats, 302 mohair kids, 445 sheep (0.02% of Texas' 2 million sheep and lambs) and 562 lambs (0.04% of Texas' 1.2 million lambs) were confirmed to have been killed by cougars that year. In Nevada in 1992, cougars were confirmed to have killed nine calves, one horse, four foals, five goats, 318 sheep, and 400 lambs. In both reports, sheep were the most frequently attacked. Some instances of surplus killing have resulted in the deaths of 20 sheep in one attack. A cougar's killing bite is applied to the back of the neck, head, or throat and the cat inflicts puncture marks with its claws usually seen on the sides and underside of the prey, sometimes also shredding the prey as it holds on. Coyotes also typically bite the throat, but the work of a cougar is generally clean, while bites inflicted by coyotes and dogs leave ragged edges. The size of the tooth puncture marks also helps distinguish kills made by cougars from those made by smaller predators.\nRemedial hunting appears to have the paradoxical effect of increased livestock predation and complaints of human-cougar conflicts. In a 2013 study the most important predictor of cougar problems were remedial hunting of cougars the previous year. Each additional cougar on the landscape increased predation and human-cougar complaints by 5%, but each additional animal killed on the landscape during the previous year increased complaints by 50%. The effect had a dose-response relationship with very heavy (100% removal of adult cougars) remedial hunting leading to a 150% \u2013 340% increase in livestock and human conflicts. This effect is attributed to the removal of older cougars that have learned to avoid people and their replacement by younger males that react differently to humans. Remedial hunting enables younger males to enter the former territories of the older animals. Predation by cougars on dogs \"is widespread, but occurs at low frequencies\".\nIn mythology\nThe grace and power of the cougar have been widely admired in the cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Inca city of Cusco is reported to have been designed in the shape of a cougar, and the animal also gave its name to both Inca regions and people. The Moche people represented the cougar often in their ceramics. The sky and thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal.\nIn North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of the Hoc\u0105k language (\"Ho-Chunk\" or \"Winnebago\") of Wisconsin and Illinois and the Cheyenne, amongst others. To the Apache and Walapai of the Southwestern United States, the wail of the cougar was a harbinger of death. The Algonquins and Ojibwe believe that the cougar lived in the underworld and was wicked, whereas it was a sacred animal among the Cherokee.\nSee also\nNotes\n^ The populations of Costa Rica and Panama are included in Appendix I ^ There are no jaguars in the area; other felids were too small to kill humans.\nReferences"}

Despite its appearance, the Hippopotamus is an animal that is actually thought to be most closely related to Whales as the two are thought to have had a common ancestor that existed roughly 54 million years ago. Also known as the Common Hippopotamus, it is one of two Hippo species that are found on the African continent with the other being the solitary and forest-dwelling Pygmy Hippopotamus which is only found in western Africa and is now Critically Endangered. Although the Common Hippopotamus remains an abundant and widespread animal throughout its current range, numbers are reportedly declining due to both hunting and habitat loss.\nHippopotamus Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Hippopotamus has an enormous grey barrel-shaped body that can measure up to five meters in length and weigh more than four tonnes, and which is held up by short and stocky legs. One of the Hippopotamus\u2019s most distinctive features is their enormous jaws which contain two long canine teeth (tusks) which can grow up to 50 cm long and are used for fighting. Due to the fact that the Hippopotamus is an animal that spends most of its life resting in the water, they have a number of excellent adaptations to aid their semi-aquatic lifestyle including four webbed toes on each foot that help with swimming and walking on slippery banks, and the eyes, ears and nostrils of the Hippopotamus are situated on the top of its head. This means that when the Hippopotamus\u2019s body is immersed in the water, they are still able to see, hear and breath whilst keeping cool in the hot sun.\nHippopotamus Distribution and Habitat\nAlthough historically the Hippopotamus would have once been found across Europe and Asia, today they are confined to Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The Hippopotamus is always found close to water and tends to prefer areas close to grasslands, where they feed during the night. Hippos are most commonly found in the deep and slow-moving rivers and lakes in eastern and southern countries, with only a few smaller and more isolated populations still found in the west. The Hippopotamus is also a resident of the seasonal wetlands where they wade through the swampy waters by day and graze on the small islands at night. Although the Hippopotamus is still common throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, their numbers have been declining with one reason being loss of their natural habitats mainly caused by land clearance for agriculture.\nHippopotamus Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe Hippopotamus spends up to 18 hours a day in the water to keep cool but when darkness falls, they venture out onto land and follow well-trodden paths to their feeding grounds, before returning to the water in the morning. The Hippopotamus is one of the largest and most feared animals in Africa as both males and females are known to be incredibly aggressive at points. The Hippopotamus tends to live in small herds containing between 10 and 20 individuals that are comprised of females with their young. The herd is led by the dominant male who will fiercely guard his stretch of river bank from both intruders and rival males, threatening them by opening his enormous mouth to expose the half-meter-long tusks. If this fails, the two will fight and deadly injuries often being caused. Although the dominant male will allow other males to enter his territory providing they are well-behaved, he holds the breeding rights with the females in the herd.\nHippopotamus Reproduction and Life Cycles\nAfter a gestation period that lasts for around eight months, the female Hippopotamus gives birth to a single calf generally during the rainy season. Although like many other activities (including mating) the Hippopotamus often gives birth in the water, it is not actually that uncommon for their young to be born on land. The female protects her calf fiercely and it rides on her back to keep it safe. Hippopotamus calves are fully weaned by the time they are 18 months old but tend to remain with their mother until they are fully grown, often not leaving her until they are 7 or 8 years old. Although young males will become more independent and find their own patch of bank to patrol, females will join a herd of other females and young but despite this seemingly sociable behaviour, they do not seem to interact socially and will even graze on their own when they leave the water at night.\nRead more about the hippo\u2019s lifespan here.\nHippopotamus Diet and Prey\nThe Hippopotamus is a herbivorous animal meaning that despite its enormously long and sharp teeth, they are vegetarians. Different species of grasses are the main source of food for the Hippopotamus that are found growing on plains relatively close to water. When they come onto land at night, Hippo\u2019s may travel up to 5km during the night to get to their feeding grounds which they do by following paths that are marked with dung. Oddly enough, the Hippopotamus doesn\u2019t even use its large canines for eating at all but instead has strong lips that are used to clip the grasses and cheek teeth which then grind them up. Despite its large size, the Hippopotamus only eats around 40kg of food a night as it uses very little energy whilst floating in the water for most of the day. In areas that are close to Human settlements, Hippos have also been known to invade crops consuming mainly rice plants and simply trampling over others. For a complete list of the food a Hippopotamus eats, have a look at our \u201cWhat Do Hippos Eat?\u201d page!\nHippopotamus Predators and Threats\nThe Hippopotamus is one of the largest mammals on the African continent and although mature adults are much harder for predators to kill, they are still preyed up by a number of predators throughout the wetlands. Big cats such as Lions and other animals like Hyenas and Crocodiles are the most common predators of the Hippopotamus, particularly of the young or sick individuals. It is because of this that females are thought to congregate in herds as larger numbers are more intimidating to hungry carnivores. The Hippopotamus is also threatened by people not only from the loss of their natural habitats, but also from hunting. The Hippopotamus has been hunted by people for both its meat and its teeth which are made of ivory. Since the ban on trading Elephant ivory, the number of Hippos killed for their teeth has risen dramatically.\nHippopotamus Interesting Facts and Features\nThe Hippopotamus has an enormous head which makes up around a third of its total body weight, with its vast mouth being able to open up to 150 degrees and revealing its large tusks which can weigh up to 3kg each. Due to the way that the skin of the Hippopotamus is made up, the animal cannot sweat so when it comes into contact with air the skin easily dries up. Although this is not a problem in the water, to combat this the rest of the time a pink, oily substance is secreted through glands in the skin which is not only thought to prevent sunburn but also may have anti-bacterial properties that helps to keep wounds clean and prevent infection from the dirty water. Even though the Hippopotamus looks like it would be slow on land thanks to its short and stubby legs, they are actually able to run at quite remarkable speeds and are capable of reaching 30mph when running.\nHippopotamus Relationship with Humans\nThe Hippopotamus can be found in all kinds of ancient African folklore with its name in Greek actually meaning \u201cWater Horse\u201d. Despite this fascination with the Hippopotamus, hunting of them for their meat and tusks has wiped them out from vast areas of their once large natural range and numbers continue to fall particularly in certain areas due to habitat loss. In these areas where the Hippopotamus is often forced to raid crops in order to find food, they are seen as pests by farmers who not only fear for their livelihood, but also for their lives themselves. The Hippopotamus is known to be an aggressive animal that is considered by many to be among Africa\u2019s most dangerous mammals, as attacks on people (particularly fishermen) are not unheard of.\nHippopotamus Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Hippopotamus is listed by the IUCN as an animal that is Vulnerable in its natural environment however, the Hippopotamus is still considered to be abundant throughout much of its current natural range with the exception of populations in western Africa that are becoming more and more isolated. Although Hippopotamus populations are considered stable in a number of countries in the south and the east of the continent, they are declining in many others and are particularly threatened by continuing poaching of them for their tusks.\nView all 71 animals that start with H"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Bandicoot images!\nThe humble bandicoot is one of the world\u2019s most well-known marsupials.\nEndemic to the Australian region, this small to medium-sized mammal looks like it was cooked up in a laboratory. The unusual appearance has earned it comparisons to rodents, rabbits, or even opossums. But it is an entirely unique type of animal all to its own. The bandicoot\u2019s calling card is the ability to poke the ground with its long snout in search of food. This has sometimes earned it the name of snout poker. However, due to changes in the Australian ecosystem, long term population numbers are in significant decline.\nAn Incredible Animal: 3 Bandicoot Facts!\nThe bandicoot entered public consciousness after the release of the popular video game Crash Bandicoot for the Sony PlayStation in 1996. Positioned as an edgy mascot in the image of Mario or Sonic, Crash is a genetically modified eastern barred bandicoot with unique powers.\nLike other marsupials, the bandicoot is an animal that carries its young in a specialized pouch for the first few weeks of life. However, there is one important difference. This pouch faces backward rather than forward to prevent dirt from entering when the bandicoot is digging in the ground.\nrather than forward to prevent dirt from entering when the bandicoot is digging in the ground. Thanks to evolutionary adaptations, bandicoots have the ability to switch between different modes of movement. They can hop around on the hind legs similar to a kangaroo or walk on all four legs. The hind limb is also a useful instrument for grooming.\nBandicoot Scientific Name\nThe word \u201cbandicoot\u201d is an informal name for a group of omnivorous marsupials that comprise the order Peramelemorphia. An order, of course, is the next highest taxonomical group of organisms right below class. To give you some idea of the diversity this implies, all living and extinct primates occupy a single order as well.\nThe order Peramelemorphia includes both the true bandicoots and the closely related bilby, which is a desert-dwelling animal known informally as the rabbit bandicoot. As scientists have learned more about the bandicoot\u2019s evolution and behavior, they have changed the classification several times, splitting apart some groups and combining others. Currently a single family known as Peramelidae contains most living species of bandicoots. Within this family, the Australian bandicoots and New Guinean bandicoots are generally split into different genera. There are currently more than 20 known species of bandicoots documented across the entire order.\nThe name bandicoot is actually a rough translation of a word pandi-kokku, or pig-rat, from the South Indian language of Telugu. The term was originally applied to an unrelated group of rodents in India before it was adapted to describe the marsupial. It also goes by several different names in local dialects.\nBandicoot: The Animal\u2019s Appearance and Behavior\nWhen first discovered, the bandicoot was originally mistaken for a type of rodent. This confusion can still occur among people today who don\u2019t know the difference. However, the bandicoot is an animal that actually descends from the marsupial lineage. Its most distinguishing features are the pointed snout, big ears, long hairless tail, round black eyes, and plump body. The hair color is brown or tan, sometimes mixed with black or white markings. The hind limbs tend to be longer than the front limbs, and two of the toes are fused together, similar to the kangaroo.\nDue to its immense diversity, the bandicoot has a large range of different body sizes. It typically varies between 12 and 31 inches in length, while the tail adds another four to 12 inches. This makes it on average about the size of a house cat. Males may be up to twice as large as females, but otherwise the sexes are similar in appearance. The main difference exhibited by the female is the rear-facing pouch with six to 10 teats to protect and feed the young. The bandicoot is one of the few marsupials to have a developed placenta. However, this placenta is small and lacks certain features, thus separating it from most other placental mammals.\nThe bandicoot is a nocturnal animal, meaning it comes out at night to feed and avoid dangerous predators. Spending most of its time hunting and foraging for food, it has a sharp sense of smell and hearing that can easily distinguish potential prey below the ground. To locate food, the bandicoot can dig holes with the sharp front claws and long snouts. It will sometimes travel more than a mile each night in search of food.\nBandicoots are solitary hunters that only congregate with each other for the breeding season. They tend to live alone in nests near a source of water. This nest is typically comprised of a small hole in the ground with a covering of foliage and vegetation. Each bandicoot has a natural range, which it will defend aggressively from intruders. The natural range of male and female bandicoots will sometimes overlap. Males are more particular about keeping other males out of their territory.\nWhen threatened, one of the bandicoot\u2019s main adaptations is its speed and agility. Its powerful hind legs enable it to jump in the air to affect a quick escape. Although bandicoots can bite, scratch, or kick, the main means of defense is to run away and hide.\nDespite its largely solitary nature, the bandicoot makes several distinctive vocalizations and sounds depending on its mood. It will sometimes emit a pig-like grunt when it\u2019s foraging and searching for food. It will also make squeak and hissing sounds when disturbed or agitated. There are additional vocalizations when mating or locating other individuals.\nMari_May/Shutterstock.com\nBandicoot Habitat\nLike most marsupials, the bandicoot evolved almost exclusively in its native habitat of Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and many smaller Pacific islands around the region. Highly adapted to this unique ecosystem of this area, the bandicoot can occupy a large range of different habitats, including woodlands, rainforests, wetlands, and grasslands at various elevations. The thick vegetation helps to conceal them from potential predators with relative ease. Bandicoots are also capable of adapting to human environments. Buildings, vehicles, and other human structures provide ample protection and hiding spots for the small animal.\nBandicoot Diet: What Does The Animal Eat?\nAll species of bandicoots have adapted, to various extents, an omnivorous diet, consisting of both meat and plant matter in different proportions. Common sources of meat include spiders, insects, small reptiles, and eggs. Common sources of plant matter include roots, berries, seeds, and tubers. However, the exact composition of the diet varies by species and region.\nAlthough these animals can sometimes be a nuisance by consuming plants and crops in gardens and farms, this annoying behavior is usually outweighed by its propensity to consume insects and other common pests as well. For this reason, the bandicoot is often a net good to humans on average.\nBandicoot Predators and Threats\nBecause of the small size and relative physical weakness, the bandicoot is a natural prey animal for native dingoes, snakes, owls, and other large birds. The introduction of foreign predator species such as cats, dogs, and foxes over the centuries has put additional pressure on population numbers. It is also believed that direct competition with rabbits may be a potential threat to the animal.\nHuman encroachment is no less dangerous to the bandicoot. Most species are suffering from a loss of habitat, particularly from farming and industry. The clearance of forests not only disrupts the animal\u2019s natural territory, but also makes it harder for them to hide from predators. As humans have reshaped the Australian ecosystem, bandicoots are more likely to be killed by diseases carried by cats and other animals. They are also carriers and vectors for their own diseases, which they can spread to people or domesticated animals.\nBandicoot: The Animal\u2019s Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe reproductive behavior of the bandicoot remains a bit of a mystery. What we do know is that they have a particularly long breeding season that may occur at different times of the year, depending on the species. It is believed that males and sometimes even females can have multiple mating partners throughout the breeding season. This ensures a high reproduction rate to counter the relatively high rate of mortality and death often encountered among the young.\nPartners will spend only a short amount of time together. The male bandicoot will usually depart soon after copulation, leaving the female to raise the young on its own. A female bandicoot will produce anywhere between two and six young at a time, although a single animal may produce multiple litters per breeding season. The gestation period lasts a very short 12 to 15 days before the children are born.\nAfter emerging from the womb, the young bandicoots, which are known as joeys, will remain in the mother\u2019s pouch for the next month or two. During this time, the joeys are naked and undeveloped and measures only about half an inch in size while feeding on the mother\u2019s milk. After leaving the pouch, the young joeys will continue to stay in the mother\u2019s nest until they are ready to live and forage on their own.\nThe typical bandicoot will reach sexual maturity within the first five or six months of its life. However, compared to many other mammals, the lifespan of the bandicoot is quite short. It is known to live only two or three years in the wild.\nBandicoot Population\nThe conservation status of the bandicoot varies widely between species. The long-nosed bandicoot, which occupies the eastern coast of Australia, is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List. However, many other species are near threatened or endangered. It is currently not known how many bandicoots are left in the world, but it is believed that they are mostly in long term decline across most of the natural range. The genus of pig-footed bandicoots, which had particularly long and thin legs, went extinct in the 20th century. The eastern barred bandicoot is completely extinct in mainland Australia and now only resides in Tasmania.\nConservationists are making an effort to breed endangered bandicoots in captivity and reintroduce them to predator-free areas in the wild. But in order to establish long term healthy populations, conservationists will also need to restore dense foliage and remove foxes and rabbits from the ecosystem. In short, the Australian landscape will need to look more like its pre-colonial state.\nView all 184 animals that start with B"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Raccoon Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Raccoon-facts.html", "text": "raccoon Facts\nPortrait of a Raccoon\nThe clever, busy and beautiful raccoon is a very common sight across much of North America. They can be found in woodlands and farmlands, but they have also adapted to a variety of human habitats including suburbs and big cities.\nRaccoons are mostly nocturnal, highly intelligent and will eat just about anything, so making their way through an urban environment is not challenging.\nTheir main requirement in any habitat is a water source. Raccoons are rarely found denning more than a few hundred yards from some constant source of water.\nStreams and ponds are ideal, but in urban and suburban situations raccoons will make use of fountains, backyard pools and koi ponds.\nThe raccoon is a carnivore which enjoys catching lots of very small prey including insects, mice, birds and fish. They have been seen fishing with their hands, and will catch toads and turtles and crayfish with their front paws as well, coming in quickly with a kill bite lest their quarry escapes their grasp.\nThe raccoon does not have opposable thumbs, and in fact, their front paws do not look human, or even primate. They are similar in shape to a weasel or ferret paw, but there is no webbing between the front toes at all, giving the digits the look of fingers.\nThe \"pinkie\" finger and \"thumb\" are offset from the middle three digits and can come together across the middle of the palm allowing the raccoon to grasp things and manipulate items with reasonable strength and extreme dexterity.\nRaccoons have been know to unscrew jars, undo locks and untie knots. The combination of bright mind and dexterous paws is highly effective and the raccoon has a reputation as a master thief and garbage-can ransacker.\nMany a homeowner has spent their spare time in a backyard war with the unstoppable neighborhood raccoons, who somehow manage to get into sheds, feed bins, dumpsters and doggie doors defying all manor of bungee cords, twist ties, latches and ropes.\nOnce considered to be in the bear family, the raccoon is now placed in the family Procyonidae which includes the coatimundi and the kinkajou, both from South America. The raccoon is further separated into its own genus, Procyon, which includes 7 species of raccoon distributed across North and Central America, that vary only slightly in size and color. - Raccoon Facts\ndo raccoons wash their food?\nraccoon \"washing\" food\nAlthough some consider the raccoon simply a common pest, it is actually anything but common.\nRaccoons have several very unusual physical specialties that make them unique in the animal world, including a wildly advanced tactile ability that is highlighted by their having whiskers on their toes!\nThese whiskers are called vibrissae and extend just beyond the raccoons front claws. Like the whiskers on many animals faces, they transmit information when the tips touch an object.\nIn fact, the raccoon\u2019s sense of touch, and in particular sensory input from the forepaws takes up more than 65% of the section of the brain that processes all sensory input. Raccoons are analyzing their world by feel and it is its most important and specialized sense.\nThe furless palms of the front paws are protected by a thin layer of horny skin - somewhat like a callous - which becomes soft and pliable when wet. This added sensitivity to already hyper sensitive hands, may be why raccoons are known to wash their food in water before eating it.\nIt may be a way for them to better \"feel\" and in a sense \"see\" what they are about to eat.\nRaccoons will use the washing motion that they use with food items with inedible items as well, and will wash things they have no intention of eating.\nraccoon paw showing vibrissae\nThey will also move food around in sand or snow prior to eating it if water is not available.\nIt seems that the famous washing motion is more of an aid to the raccoons senses, perhaps even heightening its enjoyment of its food, as we enjoy the aroma of a good meal while we dine.\nStatements to the effect that raccoons must wet their food because they have no saliva glands are not correct.\nRaccoons have saliva glands, and are capable of eating and digesting all kinds of foodstuffs without placing it in water first,(there are untold numbers of hidden-camera videos of raccoons stealing dry dog or cat kibble in the middle of the night and downing it quite happily without any water), they just seem to prefer, and enjoy, \"washing\" their food first. - Raccoon Facts\nraccoon life\nraccoon reproduction\nRaccoon mother and babies\nRacoon babies\nLike many animals of greater intelligence, raccoons are considered to have a fission-fusion society where larger groups break off into smaller units and solo animals and may come together again at different times of the day or throughout the year.\nRaccoons usually live in some sort of borrowed home. They do not dig a den like a badger does, but may use a badger den or abandoned rabbit den, or may drive those residence off in order to use their burrows.\nRaccoons also regularly use holes in trees or any other kind of natural cave to bed down in. Raccoons may have several different den sites and may share one or all of them with other raccoons.\nFemales come into season once a year, and males and females will pair up for a few days, but the male leaves after mating and is not involved in the rearing of young.\nBabies are born in about 65 days and are very lightly furred with tightly shut eyes and ears. Babies have faint masks around their eyes even when newborn, and their tail rings are visible at about five days old. The youngsters are active and venture from the nest at about 5 weeks.\nThey quickly learn to scavenge for just about anything, and by 5 months old can hunt mice or birds on their own.\nRaccoon babies walk in single-file behind their mother like little ducks.\nCubs will leave around the time that a new litter is due, although females sometimes stay in close vicinity to their mother and may continue to share a den. Young males occasionally form small bachelor groups, but in general, the society is rather free-form with overlapping territories and casual socializing.\nIt was once thought that raccoons are solitary animals, but recent research suggests even adult males socialize with each other from time to time. - Raccoon Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Urban raccoons are actually getting larger as well, coming in at about 15% to 20% heavier in cities than in the woods.\nIn the 1970's a Japanese childrens cartoon starring a rascally raccoon became so popular that the animals were exported by the hundreds for the pet trade.\nSo many of these difficult pets were released into the wild that there are now estimated to be hundreds of thousands of raccoons established in the cities and towns of Japan.\nThe raccoon has no natural enemy in Japan and has become an extremely destructive force causing destruction to temples and significant historical buildings throughout the nation. Over 10,000 raccoons are captured and killed in the nation annually but with little impact on the problem.\nOne concern many people have involves raccoons carrying rabies. Although raccoons, like many animals, can contract and pass rabies, there has never been a raccoon contracted reported case of rabies in a human being. This may be because of the high vigilance with which people treat any encounter with raccoons.\nA raccoon, especially when cornered or threatened can be extremely aggressive and bite and scratches do occur, but these injuries are almost always aggressively treated, possibly curtailing the possibility of a rabies event. - Raccoon Facts\nhow smart are raccoons?\nbring it on\nSo just how intelligent are raccoons? Although they have been replaced by the rat as the animal of choice for experimentation, between the years 1907 and 1915 the raccoon was the subject of numerous high-profile experiments.\nA psychologist by the name of Lawrence W. Cole, who studied an entire colony of raccoons established at the University of Oklahoma, and a doctoral student at Clark University named Herbert Burnham Davis, both published results on experiments using a puzzle box.\nRaccoons were placed inside boxes that required a number of manipulations to escape, and the results were not only fascinating, but extremely controversial for the time.\nThe studies suggested that raccoons were far superior to either dogs or cats at these skills, and possessed reasoning and problem solving skills on a primate level.\nThese suggestions caused an uproar in some scientific circles, and soon after raccoons became a bit of a taboo subject.\nThe concept of behaviorism was more in favor, and emphasized how animals could learn behaviors through conditioning. like the famous \"Pavlov's dog\" experiments.\nBehaviorists viewed animals as machine-like creatures that didn't possess reasoning minds, but were just responding to stimulus.\nLots of folks will argue to this day that animals don't \"think\", not taking into consideration that humans - just like all animals- can also be trained to salivate at the ringing of a bell.\nBut even John Watson, the famed psychologist who started the entire field of behaviorism, admitted that the raccoon experiments seemed scientifically valid, and he could not find a behaviorist explanation for their incredible abilities. - Raccoon Facts\na few more raccoon facts\nraccoon in the snow\nA group of raccoons is called a \"nursery\" or a \"gaze\" of raccoons\nThe word raccoon comes from a Powhatan Native American word meaning \"scrubs with hands\"\nRaccoons were once thought to be tiny bears.\nChristopher Columbus was the first to put observations about this fascinating animal down in writing\nRaccoons have whiskers on their front toes!\nRaccoons do not have opposable thumbs, but their \"pinkie\" finger and thumb can meet across the palm.\nRaccoons are born with very fine fuzz, and faint little masks around their eyes\nThe \"raccoon dog\"looks remarkably like a raccoon but is not related to the raccoon - it is in the canine family.- Raccoon Facts!\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Carnivora\nFamily Procyonidae\nGenus Procyon\nSpecies: lotor (Northern or common)\nRaccoon Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT boar sow kit, cub varied GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD nursery, gaze North America woods, forest everything TAIL AVG.

Their extreme height allows them to eat leaves and shoots located much higher than other animals can reach. In particular, they seek out acacia trees. Their long tongues are helpful in eating because they help pull leaves from the trees. Spending most of the day eating, a full-grown giraffe consumes over 45 kg (100 lb.) of leaves and twigs a day.\nThe male giraffe is both taller and heavier than the female. Both sexes have skin-covered knobs, called ossicones, on the top of their heads. Female ossicones are smaller and have a small tuft of fur on top, while male ossicones are bald on the top. These knobs are used to protect the head when males fight, which involves swinging their necks at each other in a show of strength called \u201cnecking.\u201d\nWhen giraffes walk, they move both legs on one side of their body and then both legs on the other side, which is unusual. However, they run in a similar style to other mammals, swinging their rear legs and front legs in unison. They can reach 55 km/h (35 mph) at full speed but only in brief spurts.\nGiraffes sleep less than two hours a day. In general, they sleep with their feet tucked under them and their head resting on their hindquarters, but they can also sleep for short periods of time standing up.\nFemale giraffes can become pregnant at 5 years old. They carry a baby for 15 months and give birth while standing up. Newborns are about 2 m (6 ft.) tall and weigh 70 kg (150 lb.).\nThey live up to 25 years in the wild.\nConservation Status\nGiraffes are classified by IUCN\u2019s Red List as vulnerable of extinction. After researchers surveyed the population in trucks, by foot, by aircraft, and by remote cameras, they confirmed the number of giraffes has plummeted 40% since 1985. With some subspecies, such as the reticulated giraffe, the situation is even more dire, with their population declining by nearly 80%.\nGiraffes face several threats, including loss of habitat due to logging for firewood. They are also hunted for their meat, hides, and tails, which are valued by many African tribes.\nWhat You Can Do to Help\nTo help preserve giraffe populations, boycott products made with giraffe body parts and encourage others to do the same.\nGiraffe Distribution\nGiraffe Resources\nBlog Posts about the Giraffe"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Jaguar Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Jaguar-facts.html", "text": "jaguar Facts\nPortrait of a Jaguar\nThe jaguar is the only big cat that lives in the New World. It ranges possibly as far north as the Southwest of the United States (where some individuals might still exist in Arizona) through Mexico, Central America and most prominently in South America where it is the apex predator in the rain forests of the Amazon basin.\nThe jaguar likes water and loves the Brazilian wetlands where it catches caiman, anacondas and turtles right in the water, dragging them out to dine on a marshy bank or a low-slung branch.\nJaguars are much stockier than leopards and have a much larger, rounder skull. A few minutes looking at pictures of both species and the differences, particularly in the shape of the head and face, become apparent.\nIn general, many jaguars have spots in the center of the rosettes on their coats which leopards generally do not, but the coats of these species vary greatly and really can't be reliable in identification.\nThe jaguar was extensively hunted for its fur in the past century, with jaguar coats being the most desirable of all the furs at one point. Jaguars in the tens of thousands were poached and killed for the fur industry up until the 1990's when the first conservation efforts were started.\nToday, jaguars are not often poached for their fur, but are usually killed by local villagers and farmers. The concern is for their livestock, not necessarily for their own safety, as, despite its size and shear killing power, the jaguar rarely attacks human beings.\nThe jaguar is the least likely of all the big cats to attack a human being, and is responsible for far fewer reported attacks on people - fatal or otherwise- than even its much smaller American cousin the mountain lion.\nThere were nine subspecies of jaguar recognized up until just a few years ago, but the most recent scientific and DNA research suggests their is only one species that varies significantly in size, and somewhat in color, due to differences in habitat across its range.\nJaguars can be found in populations that average about 100 pounds in denser jungle, (these areas also produce the most black panthers), and over 300 pounds in more open ranges where larger prey like horses and cattle are available. - Jaguar Facts\nwhat is a black panther?\nJaguar normal coloration and \"Black Panther\" melanistic coloration\nAmong both jaguars and their Old World cousins the leopards, there is a type of coloration known as melanism which is an increase in dark pigment of the skin and fur.\nMelanism occurs in about 6% of all individuals, and melanistic cats can be born into the same litter as normally colored cats.\nThis color variation is what is known as a \"black panther\". From a distance, Black panthers appear to be solid black in color but close up you can actually see spots on the coat.\nThe leopard is, of course, very similar in appearance to the jaguar, and is easily mistaken for one. Jaguars are generally much larger and more bulky than leopards, and have much broader, rounder heads with smaller ears and eyes.\nLeopards have much larger paws pound- for-pound, and extraordinarily long whiskers, probably due to their nocturnal hunting habits in heavy cover.\nBecause of their bulk, jaguars are not quite as agile as leopards up in the trees, though they are still excellent climbers, they tend to spend their time in lower branches.\nBut the jaguar is the apex predator in most of its range and does not have the leopards constant concern of lions, hyenas and African wild dogs stealing its prey or threatening its safety.\nTo some degree, the jaguars lifestyle is closer to that of the tiger, who is also the apex predator in its range, having only human beings to fear.\nThe jaguar simply does not have to employ the leopards strategies of extreme stealth and elusive activity high up in trees in order to survive, it can lounge comfortably wherever it sees fit.\nMelanism occurs in jaguars and leopards at approximately the same rate and the term \"black panther\" applies to melanistic individuals of both species.\nAmong cat species, the American mountain lion is also referred to as a \"panther\", as well as \"puma\" and \"cougar\", but mountain lions are only seen in their typical buff color and don't have melanistic individuals within the species. - Jaguar Facts.\nawesome jaguars\njaguar reproduction\nThe jaguar, like the leopard, is a true loner. Adults do not interact with each other except when defending their territory or mating.\nTerritories are marked with typical expressions of scratch marks on designated marking trees, urine sprays, and when there is a sense that another jaguar might be near, huffing sounds that serve as a warning. Confrontations are not desired, but in areas where their range is being encroached upon, males in particular may have rather violent battles over home turf.\nWhen a female is in season she uses a rowling type call similar to a house cat in heat (but naturally much louder!).\nShe will pair up with a male for 4 to 6 days and then send him off, often rather aggressively. Jaguar fathers never assist with young ones, or even hang around more than a day or two after impregnation.\nIn typical big cat fashion, the female will prepare a nesting area and in about 100 days give birth to one to three cubs - two is typical.\nNewborn jaguars are blind and helpless when born, and the mother moves them often to avoid the nest being detected by monkeys or snakes.\nAt three months the cubs will try their hand at hunting and by about eighteen months they will leave their mother to establish their own range.\nOnce on their own they are unlikely to ever see their mother again, and will live just as solitary a life as she did, only keeping tabs on the other cats in the neighborhood by sniffing marks and spray samples. - Jaguar Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They bathe, wallow, hunt and even occasionally eat in the water, and revel in the moisture and humidity of the rain forests. - Jaguar Facts\nhow do jaguars kill their prey?\nCompared to other big cats, and the leopard in particular, the jaguar has an unusual shape to its skull and face.\nThe jaw muscles are immense and are attached to the skull high up on the head giving jaguars a rounded, almost bulbous look to their heads.\nThe muscular jaw provides the jaguar with the most powerful bite of all the big cats.\nThe jaguar is known to use its bite power to crack open turtle shells, and, living in marshy territories, hunts and eats turtles regularly. With this adaption the jaguar has also developed a unique way of killing other prey.\nAlthough jaguars often use a more typical big cat throat bite to kill their prey, they are also known to use a bite directly to the head.\nWith their amazing bite-strength they plunge their fangs right through the skulls of animals as big as cattle, piercing the brain and ending any struggle almost immediately - Jaguar Facts\njaguars in the united states\njaguar stalking\nJaguars reportedly roamed much of the Northwest U.S. - including Arizona, New Mexico and California- when the nation was first settled, but the animals were quickly uprooted and eliminated by lots of folks with rifles.\nBut in 2009 a wild male was captured just south of Tuscon Arizona.\nThe individual was believed to be the last jaguar in the U.S. and the plans were to tag him with GPS and monitor his activities.\nUnfortunately while being examined it was discovered that the jaguar, who was believed to be about 16 years old and had been captured and tagged once before in 2004, was in very poor physical condition with many broken teeth and the beginning of kidney failure.\nThe decision was made to euthanize him, and an era probably ended on that day - Jaguar Facts\na few more jaguar facts\nThe jaguar is the only big cat that is native to the New World..\nThe jaguar is the third largest cat species in the world behind only the tiger and the lion.\nPresumably the last wild jaguar in the United States was euthanized in 2009\nJaguars are the least likely of all the big cats to attack a human being\nBlack jaguars are called \"black panthers\"\nBlack panthers occur about 6% of the time, and can be in the same litter with normal colored jaguars\nBlack panthers have faintly visible spots..\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Carnivora\nFamily Felidae\nGenus Panthera\nSpecies onca\nSub-species\nnone as of 2003\nJaguar Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT jaguar jaguaress cub solitary GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD leap, prowl Central and South America jungle, rainforest turtle, peccory ENEMIES AVG.

This means that they are only found in Australia, and nowhere else on Earth.\nMarsupials\nMany of Australia\u2019s best-known animals are marsupials. Although marsupials are also present in the Americas, around 70% of the world\u2019s marsupial species are found on the Australian continent (which includes mainland Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea).\nMarsupials are mammals whose young are born at an early stage of development. After being born, the tiny infant marsupial crawls into a special pouch in its mother\u2019s body. Here it feeds on its mother\u2019s milk and continues to develop in safety until ready to emerge.\nAnimals such as kangaroos, possums, koalas and bandicoots are marsupials. You\u2019ll meet all of these \u2013 and more \u2013 in the list below!\nAustralian Animals List with Pictures & Facts\nScroll down to see all of the animals in alphabetical order, or use the index below to find a specific species:\nAustralian Magpie\nScientific name: Gymnorhina tibicen\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Artamidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe Australian magpie is one of the most familiar Australian birds. This common species is found in habitats ranging from urban areas to forests, and is present across most of the country, only missing in some desert regions.\nThe Australian magpie has black and white plumage and orange-brown eyes. It is a similar size to the Eurasian magpie, but unlike that species is not a member of the crow family, Corvidae. Instead, it is a member of the family Artamidae, which also includes the butcherbirds.\nThe Australian magpie is famous for its warbling call.\nBack to animal index\nAustralian Sea Lion\nScientific name: Neophoca cinerea\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the eared seal family Otariidae.\nConservation status: Endangered\nThe Australian sea lion is a member of a group of animals known as the pinnipeds, which contains the seals, sea lions and walrus. The Australian sea lion is the only pinniped endemic to (only found in) Australia. The species is present along the southern and southwestern coastlines of the country.\nThis aquatic mammal feeds mainly on fish and molluscs such as squid and cuttlefish. It is also known to eat penguins.\nThe Australian sea lion was once heavily hunted. Although it is now protected, the population has not fully recovered.\nToday the species\u2019 primary threats are commercial fishing (although not targeted by the fishermen, the Australian sea lion often becomes entangled in gillnets) and habitat degradation.\nYou can find out more about the Australian sea lion here: Australian Sea Lion Facts\nBack to animal index\nBandicoot\nNumber of species: around 20\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the marsupial order Peramelemorphia (bandicoots and bilbies)\nBandicoots are a group of around 20 omnivorous, ground-dwelling marsupials found in Australia and New Guinea. They are rat-like animals with hunched backs, thin tapered noses and relatively long legs. Most are rabbit-sized. The largest bandicoot found in Australia is the northern brown bandicoot.\nBandicoots are found throughout Australia. They live in a variety of habitats, ranging from gardens to rainforests.\nBandicoots forage using their sensitive noses to detect food such as insects and earthworms buried in the ground, which they excavate with their forepaws. The holes that they leave in the ground are known as \u2018snout-pokes\u2019.\nYou can find out more about bandicoots here: Bandicoot Facts\nBack to animal index\nBarramundi\nScientific name: Lates calcarifer\nType of animal: Fish, member of the family Latidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe barramundi is a fish found on the tropical coastline of northern Australia. It has large silver scales and a humped back, and grows up to around 1.6 m (5.3 ft.) in length.\nThe barramundi is found in both freshwater and marine habitats. It lives in rivers and travels downriver to breed in estuaries and coastal wetlands. Some populations spend all of their lives in marine environments.\nBarramundi begin their lives as males, but most become female after one or more spawning seasons.\nBack to animal index\nBilby (Greater)\nScientific name: Macrotis lagotis\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the marsupial order Peramelemorphia (bandicoots and bilbies)\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nSince the lesser bilby became extinct in the 1950\u2019s, the greater bilby is the only surviving bilby. (For this reason the greater bilby is often known simply as the \u2018bilby\u2019.)\nOnce present throughout southern Australia, the greater bilby is now only found in desert regions in central Australia.\nUnlike other bandicoots, the bilby is a burrowing animal. It is equipped with powerful forelimbs and robust claws. The female\u2019s pouch is rear-opening to prevent earth from entering while burrowing. The species\u2019 long ears give it the alternative name of \u2018rabbit-eared bandicoot\u2019.\nThe bilby uses its long tongue to forage for seeds, insects and bulbs.\nYou can find out more about bilbies here: Bilby Facts\nBack to animal index\nBlack Swan\nScientific name: Cygnus atratus\nType of animal: Bird, family Anatidae (the duck, geese and swan family)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe black swan is a large waterbird found in wetlands throughout Australia. The species is an emblem of Western Australia, and appears on the state\u2019s flag and coat of arms.\nThis distinctive Australian bird has black plumage and a bright red bill with a pale tip. When it is flying or has its wings raised in an aggressive display its white flight feathers can be seen.\nThe black swan is mainly herbivorous, feeding on aquatic plants and algae. It uses its long neck to reach food, \u2018up-ending\u2019 with its head and shoulders submerged when necessary.\nBack to animal index\nBowerbirds\nType of animal: Birds, family Ptilonorhynchidae\nNumber of species: 20\nNumber of species found in Australia: 20\nBowerbirds are a family of birds found in Australia and New Guinea. Of the 20 species of bowerbird, 10 are found in Australia. Most live in rainforests and other forest habitats.\nBowerbirds are famous for their courtship ritual. This involves the male building an elaborate structure known as a bower on the forest floor. The bower is made out of sticks, and decorated with flowers, vegetation, and brightly-coloured objects, including man-made items.\nFemales usually mate with the male who has built the most impressive bower. The bower is built purely for courtship, and is not used as a nest.\nOne of the best-known Australian bowerbirds is the satin bowerbird, a species found in the coastal forests of eastern Australia. The male has glossy blue-black plumage, the female is olive-brown. Both have bright blue eyes.\nBack to animal index\nBrolga\nScientific name: Antigone rubicunda\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Gruidae (the crane family)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe brolga is a member of the crane family found in Australia and New Guinea. It was formerly known as the \u2018native companion\u2019. In Australia, it is found in wetlands and wet grasslands in the north, east and south-east of the country. The species is also found in New Guinea.\nLike all cranes, the brolga is a large, tall bird with long, thin legs and a long neck. Its plumage is grey and there is a red patch on the back of the head.\nAlthough the species\u2019 conservation status is \u2018Least Concern\u2019, it is thought that its numbers are declining, mainly as a result of habitat loss.\nBack to animal index\nBudgerigar\nScientific name: Melopsittacus undulatus\nType of animal: Bird, member of the order Psittaciformes (Parrots)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe budgerigar is a small member of the true parrot superfamily, Psittacoidea. It is found in a variety of habitats, including deserts, farmland and urban gardens, and is present throughout much of Australia. The species has also been introduced to the United States.\nThe budgie is nomadic, moving from area to area in search of water and the seeds on which it feeds.\nThe budgie is the world\u2019s third most popular pet. In the wild its plumage is predominantly yellow and green, but captive birds have been selectively bred in a number of colour variations, including blue, grey and all yellow.\nBack to animal index\nCairns Birdwing Butterfly\nScientific name: Ornithoptera euphorion\nType of animal: Insect, member of the birdwing genus Trogonoptera, part of the swallowtail family Papilionidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nWith a wingspan of up to 15 cm (5.9 in), the Cairns birdwing is one of the largest butterflies found in Australia. The species is endemic to Australia. It lives in the tropical rainforests of northeast Queensland.\nMale Cairns birdwing butterflies are smaller than the females, but considerably more brightly-coloured. Their wings are a striking mix of black, yellow and green, while those of the females are mainly black with yellow patterning.\nThe species takes its name from Cairns, a coastal city in Queensland which is at the centre of the insect\u2019s range.\nBack to animal index\nCamel (Feral)\nGenus: Camelus\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the order Artiodactyla (the even-toed ungulates)\nConservation status: Domestic\nThere are around 300,000 feral camels living in Australia. Most are the dromedaries, but a number of feral Bactrian camels are also present. These large, hooved mammals were introduced during the 19th century, when they were used as transport.\nThe feral camel population of Australia was once as large as 600,000 individuals. Due to the damage this introduced species was causing to indigenous wildlife, measures were taken between 2009 and 2013 to reduce the population to its current size.\nYou can find out more about the Bactrian camel here: Bactrian Camel Facts\nBack to animal index\nCane Toad\nScientific name: Rhinella marina\nType of animal: Amphibian, member of the true toad family Bufonidae.\nConservation status: Least Concern\nMany Australians would rather the cane toad was not on a list of Australian animals! The amphibian is an invasive species in Australia and has spread rapidly across the country since its introduction in the 1940s.\nThe insect-eating frog was brought to Australia from its native South America in order to reduce the population of crop-destroying grey-backed cane beetles.\nUnfortunately, the cane toad bred rapidly and quickly spread across north-eastern Australia. The species\u2019 introduction has been catastrophic to many native Australian species, who fall ill after eating the poisonous toad.\nYou can find out more about cane toads here: Cane Toad Facts\nBack to animal index\nCassowary\nGenus: Casuarius\nNumber of species: 3\nNumber of species found in Australia: 1 (The southern cassowary)\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Casuariidae (which also includes the emu)\nCassowaries are large, flightless birds found in Australia and New Guinea. There are three species of cassowary; only the Southern Cassowary (scientific name Casuarius casuarius) is found in Australia (the species is also found in New Guinea).\nThe southern cassowary inhabits the rainforests of north-eastern Australia. It is the world\u2019s second-heaviest bird, and the third-tallest.\nThe species is mainly black, with a blue neck and red collar. Its wattles (the fleshy growths that hang from the bird\u2019s neck) are red. On the cassowary\u2019s head is a bony, pointed, helmet-like structure known as a casque.\nCassowaries are fast runners. Their feet are equipped with dagger-like inner claws which may be used as weapons if the bird feels threatened.\nThe conservation status of the southern cassowary is Least Concern.\nYou can find out more about cassowaries here: Cassowary Facts\nBack to animal index\nCommon Stingaree\nScientific name: Trygonoptera testacea\nType of animal: Fish, superorder Batoidea (rays)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe common stingaree is a stingray found in the coastal waters of south-eastern Australia. It is the commonest ray found in this region.\nLike all stingrays, the common stingaree has a round, flat body and long tail. It propels itself through the water with wave-like undulations of its wings. Its tail is equipped with either one or two venomous spines.\nThe species lives on sandbanks and mudflats, often lying partly buried on the sea bed. Although the fish will usually flee from bathers, if surprised it will lash out with its spines, and is capable of inflicting nasty injuries.\nBack to animal index\nCrocodiles\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the subfamily Crocodylinae (the true crocodiles)\nNumber of species found in Australia: 2 (the saltwater crocodile and the freshwater crocodile)\nConservation status (both species): Least Concern\nThere are two species of crocodile found in Australia: the freshwater crocodile and the larger saltwater crocodile.\nThe freshwater crocodile is a relatively small crocodile. It is endemic to Australia and is found in rivers and wetlands in the north of the country.\nThe saltwater crocodile is the largest reptile not only in Australia but also the world. In fact, this cold-blooded giant is the world\u2019s largest land predator. It is found on and near the coast in northern Australia, as well as in New Guinea and several Southeast Asian countries.\nBoth Australian crocodiles have armour-plated skin and strong jaws full of sharp teeth. Crocodiles are ambush predators, which means that they lie in wait for their prey to draw near before attacking with explosive speed and power.\nThe freshwater crocodile will usually only attack a human if threatened. It is capable of delivering a powerful bite.\nThe saltwater crocodile, due to its size, power and ferocity, is an extremely dangerous animal and areas in which it is found are best avoided.\nYou can find out more about the freshwater crocodile here: Freshwater Crocodile Facts\nYou can find out more about the saltwater crocodile here: Saltwater Crocodile Facts\nBack to animal index\nDingo\nScientific name: Canis lupus dingo\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the dog family Canidae\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nThe dingo is a large wild dog with sandy-gold fur. It lives in desert, grassland and forest habitats.\nMost zoologists consider the dingo to be a subspecies of grey wolf, giving it the scientific name Canis lupus dingo. Others consider the dingo to be a separate species in its own right, giving it the scientific name Canis dingo.\nThe dingo\u2019s closest relative is the New Guinea singing dog, a wild dog found on New Guinea.\nDingoes live and hunt in packs. Using teamwork they are able to bring down animals as large as the red kangaroo.\nYou can find out more about this species here: Dingo Facts\nBack to animal index\nDugong\nScientific name: Dugong dugon\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the order Sirenia\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nThe dugong is a marine mammal which, together with the three species of manatee, is a member of the order Sirenia. It is a large, round-bodied animal. Its unique, broad, downwards-pointing snout is an adaptation for feeding on seagrass.\nDugongs can live for up to 70 years, and in the past have been hunted for meat and oil. Today the main threats to the species are entanglement in gillnets, hunting, and boat strikes.\nYou can find out more about the dugong here: Dugong Facts\nBack to animal index\nEastern Brown Snake\nScientific name: Pseudonaja textilis\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Elapidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nBoth of the world\u2019s two most venomous snakes \u2013 the eastern brown snake and the inland taipan \u2013 are found in Australia.\nAlthough the venom of the eastern brown snake is less powerful than that of the inland taipan, the species is considered more dangerous, as it is found near human habitations and has an aggressive temperament. It is responsible for more fatalities per year in Australia than any other snake.\nThe eastern brown snake grows to lengths of up 2 m (7 ft.). It is a relatively thin snake that ranges in colour from pale to dark brown. It is found in a variety of habitats across eastern Australia.\nBack to animal index\nEastern Long-Necked Turtle\nScientific name: Chelodina longicollis\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Chelidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe eastern long-necked turtle is found in rivers and wetlands in south eastern Australia. It has a round, plate-sized carapace (shell) which is black or brown with black grooves. The species\u2019 neck is over half of the length of its shell.\nEastern long-neck turtles are members of the suborder Pleurodira, one of two turtle suborders (the other being the Cryptodira). Members of this suborder withdraw their heads into their shells with a sideways, rather than a straight, motion.\nBack to animal index\nEchidna (Short Beaked)\nScientific name: Tachyglossus aculeatus\nType of animal: Mammal, order Monotremata (the monotremes)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nEchidnas are members of a unique group of mammals known as monotremes. Unlike every other type of mammal the five species that make up the order Monotremata lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young. The monotremes comprise four species of echidna and the platypus.\nThe short-beaked echidna is the only echidna found in Australia. It is present throughout much of the country, and is also found in New Guinea.\nThe short-beaked echidna is a small to medium-sized animal, usually between 30 and 45 cm in length. Its most distinctive characteristic is its coat of hard spines. It is equipped with powerful forelimbs and clawed feet, and is capable of burrowing at high speeds.\nEchidnas are also known as \u2018spiny anteaters\u2019, but \u2013 although their diet consists of ants and termites \u2013 they are not related to the anteaters of the Americas.\nYou can find out more about echidnas here: Echidna Facts\nBack to animal index\nEmu\nScientific name: Dromaius novaehollandiae\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Casuariidae (which also includes the cassowaries).\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe emu is a large flightless bird endemic to Australia. With an average weight of 33 kg (73 lb), it is the world\u2019s 5th largest bird, and the second-largest in Australia, after the southern cassowary.\nAlthough second to the southern cassowary in weight, the emu can reach a height of 1.9 metres (6.2 ft.), making it Australia\u2019s tallest bird.\nThe emu\u2019s plumage is light brown, and its sparsely-feathered neck is pale blue.\nThe flightless emu evades potential predators using its acute eyesight and hearing, and if necessary its high speed: it is capable of running at up to 48 km/h (30 mph). If cornered it can defend itself with its sharp claws and powerful legs.\nBack to animal index\nFairy Penguin\nScientific name: Eudyptula minor\nType of animal: Bird, member of the penguin family Spheniscidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe little penguin, commonly known as the fairy penguin in Australia, is the smallest species of penguin, standing at around 33 cm (13 in) tall and weighing around 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).\nThis small seabird is found along the south coast of Australia, both on the mainland and on coastal islands. The species is also found in New Zealand.\nThe dark sections of the little penguin\u2019s plumage are blue-grey in colour, giving the species the name \u2018little blue penguin\u2019 in New Zealand.\nLike all penguins the little penguin is flightless, its wings having adapted into flippers that allow it to \u2018fly\u2019 through the water. The little penguin spends around 80% of its life at sea, where it forages for fish and squid.\nYou can find out more about little penguins here: Little Penguin Facts\nBack to animal index\nFlatback Sea Turtle\nScientific name: Natator depressus\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Cheloniidae\nConservation status: Data Deficient\nThe flatback sea turtle is found in the coastal waters of northern Australia and New Guinea, but only nests on the islands and beaches of northern Australia.\nThis large marine reptile is the least migratory of the seven species of sea turtle. It can be distinguished from other sea turtles by its comparatively flat shell.\nYou can find out more about the flatback sea turtle animal here: Flatback Sea Turtle Facts\nBack to animal index\nFrill-Necked Lizard\nScientific name: Chlamydosaurus kingii\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Agamidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe frill-necked lizard is a large lizard found across northern Australia. The species is arboreal (tree-dwelling) and usually found in the canopy layer of forests and woodlands. Its average length is 85 cm (2.79 ft.).\nThe frill-necked lizard gets its name from the large ruff of brightly-coloured skin around its neck. The ruff is connected to the lizard\u2019s jaw bone. When threatened, the lizard opens the ruff out like an umbrella. This impressive display is intended to startle a potential predator, giving the lizard a chance to escape.\nYou can find-out more about this distinctive Australian reptile here: Frill-Necked Lizard Facts\nBack to animal index\nGalah\nScientific name: Eolophus roseicapilla\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Cacatuidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe galah is a highly-social parrot with a widespread distribution across Australia. It occupies a diverse range of habitats, including woodlands, shrublands, meadows and urban areas.\nThe species forms large, noisy flocks that forage on the ground, feeding on the seeds of grasses, herbs and crops.\nA member of the cockatoo family Cacatuidae, the galah is easily identified by the vibrant pink-coloured feathers on its head, neck, and underparts, and by the paler pink crest that can either be held erect or laid back. The wings, back, and tail are grey.\nAlthough males and females look very similar, they can be distinguished by the colour of their irises: red or mid-brown for females and dark brown for males.\nBack to animal index\nGiant Burrowing Cockroach\nScientific name: Macropanesthia rhinoceros\nType of animal: Insect, member of the family Blaberidae.\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe giant burrowing cockroach is the heaviest cockroach in the world, weighing up to 35 g and reaching a length of up to 8 cm. It has a lifespan of up to 10 years.\nThe giant burrowing cockroach doesn\u2019t have wings, and spends much of its life underground in burrows that can be up to 1m deep. The species emerges from its burrow at night to feed.\nUnlike most insects, the giant burrowing cockroach gives birth to live young rather than laying eggs. The species is ovoviviparous, with the eggs hatching inside the mother\u2019s body prior to being born.\nFemales give birth in underground chambers and care for their young for up to six months, at which point the young leave the chamber to fend for themselves.\nThe giant burrowing cockroach is mostly found in the tropical regions of Queensland, and prefers areas with sandy soil. Unlike other cockroaches, it is not considered a pest. The species plays an essential role in the ecosystem by consuming dead leaves and recycling matter.\nBack to animal index\nGiant Clam\nScientific name: Tridacna gigas\nType of animal: Bivalve, member of the family Cardiidae.\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nTridacna gigas, one of several species known as \u2018giant clams\u2019, is the world\u2019s largest bivalve mollusc. The species reaches lengths of up to 1.5 m and can exceed 500 lbs in weight. It is found in the warm waters of the South Pacific and Indian Ocean.\nThe giant clam\u2019s mantle is generally yellow or green with blue or purple spots. The clam\u2019s stunning colours are a result of algae that live within the mollusc\u2019s tissue.\nThe clam and its resident algae have a symbiotic relationship (a relationship between species that is mutually beneficial). The clam receives nutrients produced by the algae as a result of photosynthesis. In return, the algae receives carbon dioxide, phosphates, nitrates, and a place to live.\nThe giant clam\u2019s \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 conservation status is a result of its having been over-harvested for food and the aquarium trade.\nBack to animal index\nGoanna\nType of animal: Reptile, lizards in the genus Varanus (the monitor lizards)\nNumber of species found in Australia: 25\nGoannas are lizards in the genus Varanus (a group known as the monitor lizards). There are 25 goanna species found in Australia, and a further 5 species found in Southeast Asia.\nThe perentie (Varanus giganteus), which grows up to 2.5 m (8 ft. 2 in) in length, is Australia\u2019s largest lizard, and the fourth-largest lizard in the world. Australia\u2019s smallest goanna is the short-tailed monitor.\nGoannas are carnivores, equipped with sharp teeth and claws. Their diet consists of a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate species, including insects, spiders, snakes, birds, marsupials and rodents.\nGoannas aren\u2019t fussy eaters; in general the larger the goanna, the larger the prey animal it will consume. Goannas will also scavenge on carrion.\nYou can find out more about goannas here: Goanna Facts\nYou can find out more about the perentie here: Perentie Facts\nBack to animal index\nGoliath Stick Insect\nScientific name: Eurycnema goliath\nType of animal: Insect, member of the family Phasmatidae.\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe Goliath stick insect is found along the Australian east coast and southern Queensland. Despite being one of the largest insects in Australia, its camouflage and stick-like body make it tricky to find.\nFemale Goliath stick insects are much larger than males, reaching up to 25 cm in length.\nLike many stick insects, the goliath stick insect is capable of parthenogenesis, a form of reproduction that does not require mating.\nDespite having wings, females are unable to fly due to the size of their bodies. The smaller, thinner males are capable of flight.\nBack to animal index\nGreat White Shark\nScientific name: Carcharodon carcharias\nType of animal: Fish, member of the mackerel shark order Lamniformes\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nOne of the most feared of all ocean predators, the great white shark can grow to over 6 metres (19.7 ft.) in length. It is found in oceans all around the world, including those around Australia.\nThis big fish preys on a variety of animals, with juveniles more likely to target fish, and adults more likely to target marine mammals such as seals, dolphins and other cetaceans. The great white is also known to attack humans.\nThe great white shark uses a \u2018sixth sense\u2019 when hunting. Organs known as ampullae of Lorenzini in the shark\u2019s head act as electroreceptors, allowing the shark to sense the electrical fields produced in the muscles of other sea animals.\nYou can find out more about the great white shark here: Great White Shark Facts\nBack to animal index\nHercules Moth\nScientific name: Coscinocera hercules\nType of animal: Insect, member of the family Saturniidae.\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe Hercules moth is Australia\u2019s largest moth and one of the three largest moths in the world. The species, which is found on New Guinea as well as in tropical Queensland, has a wingspan of up to 27 cm (10.63 in.). The surface area of this huge insect\u2019s wings is the largest of any insect.\nThe Hercules moth has large, brown wings with transparent windows and white edges. The female\u2019s wings are so large that it can often be mistaken for a bird. The male is smaller than the female and more vibrantly-coloured. Its wings have elongated tails.\nIn its imago stage (the winged, adult stage), the Hercules moth does not eat, and lives for only 2 to 8 days. Adult females emit pheromones which can be detected by males up to 3 km away. After mating, a female lays 80 to 100 eggs on the leaves of rainforest plants and dies shortly after.\nBack to animal index\nInland Taipan\nScientific name: Oxyuranus microlepidotus\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Elapidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe inland taipan is the world\u2019s most venomous snake. The potency of its venom is a result of the species having evolved specifically as a hunter of mammals. Just one bite is thought to contain enough venom to kill 100 men.\nDespite its formidable bite, the inland taipan is responsible for relatively few attacks on humans. Unlike the closely related coastal taipan (one of the world\u2019s most dangerous snakes), the species has a placid nature and lives in uninhabited areas.\nYou can find out more about this species here: Inland Taipan Facts\nBack to animal index\nKangaroo\nType of animal: Mammal, marsupial\nFamily: Macropodidae (the macropods)\nConservation status: A number of kangaroo species are under threat, in particular the tree kangaroos, many of which are endangered.\nNumber of species found in Australia: 4 species are commonly known as kangaroos; the family Macropodidae contains around 65 living species\nNo list of Australian animals would be complete without the kangaroo! There are over 30 million of these familiar marsupials living in Australia.\nThe family Macropodidae comprises the kangaroos, wallaroos and wallabies. It is mainly size that determines in which of these three groups an animal is placed; the largest species are known as kangaroos, the smallest as wallabies, and those in between are called wallaroos.\nFour species are commonly known as kangaroos. They are: the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus); the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus); the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus); and the antilopine kangaroo (Macropus antilopinus). There are around 60 other species in the family Macropodidae.\nThe red kangaroo is not only the largest kangaroo, but also the largest living marsupial.\nKangaroos travel by hopping rather than by walking or running. This is a surprisingly efficient means of locomotion; kangaroos have special elasticated tendons which store and release energy as the kangaroo hops.\nKangaroos, like many of Australia\u2019s most famous animals, are marsupials. Marsupials are \u2018pouched mammals\u2019. After being born their babies \u2013 known as \u2018joeys\u2019 \u2013 climb into special pouches in their mothers\u2019 bodies. Here the joeys continue to grow for several more months before being able to jump around by themselves.\nYou can find out more about kangaroos here: Kangaroo Facts\nYou can find out more about the red kangaroo here: Red Kangaroo Facts\nBack to animal index\nKoala\nScientific name: Phascolarctos cinereus\nType of animal: Mammal, marsupial. The only living member of the family Phascolarctidae.\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nThe koala is one of the best-known of all Australian animals. This arboreal (tree-dwelling) marsupial is found mainly in eastern Australia.\nThe koala can be identified by its thick grey coat, prominent black nose and fluffy ears. It resembles a small bear, and because of this is sometimes known as the \u2018koala bear\u2019. However, the koala is not a bear; being a marsupial, it is not related to the true bears in the family Ursidae, which are placental mammals.\nKoalas spend most of their lives (up to 20 hours per day) sleeping. Their diet consists mainly of eucalyptus leaves, which contain little in the way of energy.\nDespite their cuddly appearance, male koalas can be surprisingly aggressive when competing for territory.\nYou can find out more about the koala here: Koala Facts\nBack to animal index\nKookaburra\nGenus: Dacelo\nType of animal: Birds, members of the kingfisher family Alcedinidae\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in the Australian bush and heard someone laughing, then don\u2019t worry, you weren\u2019t being made fun of; it was probably just a kookaburra \u2013 these Australian birds have a call that sounds like human laughter.\nKookaburras are birds in the subfamily of kingfishers known as the tree kingfishers, or Halcyoninae. The laughing kookaburra, with its famous call, is one of four species of kookaburra.\nKookaburras can be recognized by their large, powerful bills and the flashes of blue in their wings. Despite being members of the kingfisher family, they rarely eat fish, instead targeting a variety of small mammals and reptiles.\nYou can find out more about kookaburras here: Kookaburra Facts\nBack to animal index\nMarsupial Mole\nScientific name: Notoryctes caurinus; Notoryctes typhlops\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the family Notoryctidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThere are two species of marsupial mole: the northern marsupial mole (Notoryctes caurinus) and the southern marsupial mole (Notoryctes typhlops). Both inhabit the deserts of Western Australia.\nThese small, insectivorous (insect-eating) marsupials spend nearly all of their lives burrowing underground, rarely coming to the surface.\nMarsupial moles have undergone numerous adaptations for this underground lifestyle, including short limbs and powerful claws for digging, and the pouch of the female being rear-facing so as not to fill up with sand. Both species are completely blind.\nDespite being marsupials, marsupial moles are very similar in appearance to burrowing placental mammals such as the golden moles of Africa. This is an example of convergent evolution \u2013 the process by which unrelated species develop similar characteristics.\n(Another example of convergent evolution is the winged flight of both birds and bats.)\nBack to animal index\nMurray Cod\nScientific name: Maccullochella peelii\nType of animal: Ray-finned fish, member of the family Percichthyidae\nConservation status: Critically Endangered\nThe Murray cod is the largest native Australian freshwater fish species. It inhabits the Murray-Darling basin, an area which covers much of south-eastern Australia.\nThe species has a dark green mottled upper body and a creamy-white underside. It can weigh over 100 kg and reach lengths of up to 1.8 m long. Its lifespan can exceed 50 years.\nThe Murray cod is known to be a voracious and aggressive predator, feeding on other fish, ducks, snakes, mice, frogs, and even freshwater turtles.\nToday, this impressive fish is seriously threatened by commercial and recreational fishing, habitat destruction, water pollution, and invasive species.\nBack to animal index\nNumbat\nScientific name: Myrmecobius fasciatus\nType of animal: Marsupial, the only member of the family Myrmecobiidae\nConservation status: Endangered\nThe numbat is a small marsupial with an appearance somewhere between a cat and a rat. It has a pointed face, a long, bushy tail, and a series of distinctive white stripes running along its back.\nNumbats use their pointed muzzles to forage in the dirt for termites, which they scoop up with their long tongues.\nThe numbat has a number of natural predators, but it was the introduction of the red fox by settlers that led to the species becoming endangered. Today, only around 800 of this once widespread animal are left in the wild.\nYou can find out more about the numbat here: Numbat Facts\nBack to animal index\nPlatypus\nScientific name: Ornithorhynchus anatinus\nType of animal: Mammal, monotreme\nConservation status: Near Threatened\nThe platypus is one of Australia\u2019s best-known animals, and also one of the strangest. This distinctive mammal has the bill of a duck, the tail of a beaver, and the feet of an otter. It is also one of the few venomous mammals, with males being armed with a venomous spur on their feet.\nWhen the remains of a platypus were first brought to London for examination, the experts thought that someone was playing a trick on them!\nThe platypus belongs to a small group of mammals known as monotremes, whose members lay eggs instead of giving birth to their young. There are only five living monotremes: the platypus, and four species of echidna.\nThe platypus spends much of its life foraging for food on the beds of streams and rivers. It has electroreceptors in its bill with which it can detect electrical fields produced by the muscles of its prey.\nYou can find out more about the platypus here: Platypus Facts\nBack to animal index\nPossum\nType of animal: Marsupial\nSuborder: Phalangeriformes\nPossums are small to medium-sized nocturnal marsupials, most of which are arboreal (tree-dwelling). There are around 70 species of possum in the suborder Phalangeriformes. The group includes the \u2018gliders\u2019; a group of possums that have evolved the ability to glide from tree to tree.\nThe Tasmanian pygmy possum (Cercartetus lepidus) is the world\u2019s smallest possum, with a maximum nose to tail length of just 30 cm (12 in.).\nThe common brushtail possum is the largest possum found in Australia, and the world\u2019s third-largest possum, after the two bear cuscuses (which are both found in Indonesia).\nBack to animal index\nQueensland Lungfish / Barramunda\nScientific name: Neoceratodus forsteri\nType of animal: Lobe-finned fish, member of the family Ceratodontidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe Queensland lungfish is a freshwater fish endemic to south-eastern Queensland. It is native to the Mary and Burnett River systems and has been introduced to other Queensland rivers, including the Coomera, Condamine, Albert and Logan.\nUnlike most other fishes, the Queensland lungfish is able to breathe air. It is one of six living lungfish species, and the only one found in Australia.\nWhereas the other five species of lungfish have two lungs and are unable to breathe with their gills, the Queensland lungfish has a single lung, which it uses in addition to its gills.\nThe species can live for up to 100 years.\nBack to animal index\nQuokka\nScientific name: Setonix brachyurus\nType of animal: Marsupial in the family Macropodidae\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nAround the size of a domestic cat, the quokka is an herbivorous marsupial that resembles a miniature kangaroo. It is a member of the same family, Macropodidae, as its kangaroo and wallaby cousins.\nThe quokka is found mainly on islands lying off the southwestern coast of Australia, with only a small population remaining on the mainland. The species suffered greatly as a result of the introduction of the red fox, and was once found across a much wider range.\nYou can find out more about the quokka here: Quokka Facts\nBack to animal index\nQuoll\nType of animal: Marsupials in the genus Dasyurus\nNumber of species found in Australia: 4\nQuolls are small to mid-sized, nocturnal, carnivorous marsupials. There are six species of quoll, four of which\u2013the western, eastern, northern and tiger quoll\u2013 are found in Australia. (The other two species\u2013the bronze quoll and the New Guinean quoll\u2013are found in New Guinea.)\nQuolls have brown or black coats marked with distinctive pale spots. They prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.\nBoth the eastern quoll and the northern quoll are Endangered, while the conservation status of the other two Australian species is Near Threatened.\nLike many of Australia\u2019s native animals, quolls suffered greatly with the introduction of non-native predators such as the red fox and domestic cat.\nOne of the main threats to quolls comes in the form of another non-native animal: the cane toad. Although not predatory, the cane toad is poisonous. Native Australian animals that prey on the amphibian are likely to become ill or die.\nYou can find out more about the quoll here: Quoll Facts\nBack to animal index\nRedback Spider\nScientific name: Latrodectus hasselti\nType of animal: Arachnid, member of the family Theridiidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe redback spider is one of Australia\u2019s best-known, and most feared, spiders. The species\u2019 notoriety is due to bite of the female, which is extremely painful and whose symptoms can last from several hours to several days. Although extremely uncomfortable, the redback spider\u2019s bite is seldom fatal to humans.\nWith a body length of around 1 cm, female redback spiders are over twice the size of males.\nThe species is black with a contrasting red stripe running along the centre of the back of the abdomen. On the underside of the abdomen is a red \u2018hourglass\u2019 marking.\nRedback spiders are widely distributed throughout Australia but are most often found in urban areas. Although their diet consists mainly of insects, they will also eat small birds, lizards, rodents, flies, crickets, and beetles.\nYou won\u2019t find many daddy redback spiders; during reproduction, females practice cannibalism.\nYou can find out more about the redback spider here: Redback Spider Facts\nBack to animal index\nRed-Eyed Tree Frog\nScientific name: Litoria chloris\nType of animal: Amphibian, member of the family Hylidae (the tree frogs)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe red-eyed tree frog of Australia is a different species to the South American amphibian of the same name. Both species are in the tree frog family Hylidae.\nThe Australian red-eyed tree frog is found in rainforests and other moist forest habitats in eastern Queensland and New South Wales. It spends most of its life in the forest canopy, only coming down to the ground to breed after periods of heavy rain.\nThis Australian amphibian is bright green with yellow undersides. Its eyes \u2013 as its name suggests \u2013 are orange-red. The species is not threatened in the wild, and is also kept as a pet.\nBack to animal index\nSugar Glider\nScientific name: Petaurus breviceps\nType of animal: Marsupial\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe sugar glider is a gliding possum found not only in Australia, but also on New Guinea and some Indonesian islands.\nThis small, nocturnal marsupial is equipped with flaps of skin between its arms and legs. These act as wings, allowing the sugar glider to glide from tree to tree.\nThe omnivorous sugar glider eats insects, leaves and eucalyptus sap. This opportunist hunter may also eat small reptiles and birds when the chance arises.\nYou can find out more about sugar gliders here: Sugar Glider Facts\nBack to animal index\nSydney Funnel-Web Spider\nScientific name: Atrax robustus\nType of animal: Arachnid, member of the family Hexathelidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nFound within a 100-km radius of Sydney, the Sydney funnel-web spider is known for its dangerous bite, which, if untreated, can be fatal. The species\u2019 venom is one of the most toxic of any spider.\nThe Sydney funnel-web spider is shiny dark brown / black, and between 1 and 5 cm in body length.\nThe species builds web-lined burrows from which it emerges to ambush passing prey. Web \u2018tripwires\u2019 alert the spider to the presence of prey outside of the burrow.\nThe spider prefers moist areas with constant humidity. It builds its burrows under logs and rocks, and in ground debris.\nThe Sydney funnel-web spider feeds mainly on insects such as cockroaches, beetles, and various larvae. It will also occasionally prey on snails, frogs and other small vertebrates.\nYou can find out more about the Sydney funnel-web spider here: Sydney Funnel-Web Spider Facts\nBack to animal index\nTasmanian Devil\nScientific name: Sarcophilus harrisii\nType of animal: Marsupial\nConservation status: Endangered\nThe Tasmanian devil is a carnivorous marsupial today found only in Tasmania, but once also found on mainland Australia. Its extinction on the mainland may have been caused by the presence of dingoes introduced by Aboriginal Australians.\nThe species is known for its ferocity, particularly when feeding, when it makes a distinctive screeching sound. It is this \u2018devilish\u2019 sound that gives the species its name.\nThe Tasmanian devil has the strongest bite force in relation to body size of any carnivorous mammal.\nToday, the Tasmanian devil\u2019s very survival is threatened by the spread of a killer disease known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). This highly-contagious disease, which causes sores to break out around the animal\u2019s face, has caused a huge decline in the species\u2019 population.\nYou can find out more about the Tasmanian devil here: Tasmanian Devil Facts\nBack to animal index\nThorny Devil\nScientific name: Moloch horridus Type of animal: Reptile; lizard in the family Agamidae Conservation status: Least Concern\nThis fearsome-looking lizard is found in the dry inland regions of Australia. Despite its aggressive appearance, the thorny devil is only dangerous if you happen to be an ant (this little reptile eats several thousand ants every day).\nThe thorny devil has a number of adaptations for living in the desert, including grooves in its skin that channel moisture to its mouth, and a false head to confuse predators.\nYou can find out more about this Australian reptile here: Thorny Devil Facts\nBack to animal index\nTurtle Frog / Tortoise Frog\nScientific name: Myobatrachus gouldii\nType of animal: Amphibian, member of the family Myobatrachidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe turtle frog (also known as a tortoise frog) is a small frog found in the southwestern corner of Western Australia. It lives in semi-arid areas, and has powerful limbs for burrowing in the sandy soil. The species gets its name from its turtle-like appearance. It has a round, flat body and resembles a turtle without a shell.\nThe turtle frog is unusual among frogs because it skips the tadpole stage of its development, instead hatching from its egg as a small frog.\nBack to animal index\nUlysses Butterfly / Blue Emperor\nScientific name: Papilio ulysses\nType of animal: Insect, member of the family Papilionidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nUlysses butterflies inhabit the tropical rainforests of north-eastern Australia, New Guinea, the Moluccas, Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands. They are also seen in suburban gardens in Queensland.\nThe wingspan of the Ulysses butterfly is around 10 cm. Males have vibrant iridescent blue colour wings with black edges. The blue colouration of the female\u2019s wings is duller. The underside of the wings of both sexes is dark-brown, which provides camouflage when the insect is at rest.\nBoth males and females have the characteristic elongated tail streamers of butterflies in the swallowtail family, Papilionidae.\nThis striking butterfly species feeds on nectar, in particular that from flowers of the species Lantana camara.\nMales are strongly attracted to the colour blue and will approach man-made objects of this colour.\nBack to animal index\nWallaby\nType of animal: Mammal, marsupial\nFamily: Macropodidae\nWallabies, like kangaroos, are members of the family Macropodidae. Wallabies are the smallest members of the family, with the smallest species\u2013the dwarf wallaby\u2013reaching just 46 cm (18 in) in total length.\nWallabies are found not just in Australia, but also on New Guinea. These herbivorous marsupials are found in a variety of habitats, including forests and rocky terrain. Rock wallabies have specially adapted, rough-soled feet for gripping onto rocks.\nBack to animal index\nWhite-Lipped Tree Frog / Giant Tree Frog\nScientific name: Litoria infrafrenata\nType of animal: Amphibian, member of the family Hylidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe white-lipped tree frog is the world\u2019s largest tree frog species, reaching a maximum length of 14 cm (5.5 in.).

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Golden Lion Tamarin Facts: Animals of South America", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/golden-lion-tamarin-facts-animals-of-south-america.html", "text": "The Golden lion tamarin, also known as the Golden Marmoset, is endemic to the coastal Atlantic forest in the region of Brazil. It is a monkey of the new world and listed as endangered. It is estimated that about 3,500 individuals of this animal in the wild. The Golden lion tamarin now struggle to survive in few forest locations of their original range due to high rates of deforestation that has taken place over the years.\nReproduction\nUntil 1970, a trend in the reproduction of the Golden lion tamarin population was noted to be dismal which greatly affected the population growth of this precious species. At the age of 16 to 20 months, the Golden lion tamarin becomes sexually mature. Being seasonal breeders, the Golden lion tamarin usually bear their litters in July and November during the temperate zone in Brazil. A change in the animal\u2019s socio-sexual interactions between the different genders occurs when the females reach 2-3 weeks in their estrus cycle. Grooming occurs, and constant interaction and sniffing of the Golden lion tamarin increases as the peak of the estrus cycle. The documented gestation period is 130-145 days. Giving birth to 1-3 young ones is the norm when they weigh close to 20z. With the male always insisting on taking part in the rearing of the young ones, the weaning period lasts for three months at most.\nBehavior\nThe Golden lion tamarin likes to remain close with their family members and travel in manageable groups of 2-8 individuals. They are agile and active, always running around, jumping, and leaping from tree to tree. When in a resting state, the tamarins normally fold their fingers inwards for excellent support while clinging to different branches. Through the movement of their eyelids, hairy heads, and eyes, the tamarins express their emotions and communicate with each other. Engaging in mutual grooming enables the Golden lion tamarin to always care for their beautiful fur.\nHabitat and Range\nGolden lion tamarins reside in the dense forest areas packed with trees and vines. They are mostly found around Rio de Janeiro in the Atlantic coastal forest of Brazil. This high humidity of the area offers the tamarins beautiful lush vegetation which is approximately 30 to 90 feet off the ground. To protect themselves from any predators the tamarins usually sleep in the tree holes which also offer them warmth at night.\nDiet\nThrough micromanipulation, the Golden lion tamarin normally search barks, crevices, and bromeliads among other hiding locations to find their prey. They are known to be omnivorous so apart from probing different areas for live prey, they feed on tree gum, flowers, succulent leaves, and nectar. When placed in the zoo, they are normally given a marmoset diet consisting of marmoset jelly, mealworms, monkey chow, and fruit slices.\nPhysical Description\nThe Golden lion tamarin\u2019s male is noticeably larger than their female counterparts, but both have a similar lifespan of 10-12 years. These tamarins are one of the world\u2019s rarest and striking land mammals due to their silky golden hair from where their name was derived. The lustrous golden fur covers most parts of the body, with their faces being majorly naked. Some tamarins have brown or black fur coloration on the tail and forepaws. The Golden lion tamarin does not have opposable thumbs found on the shorter forelimbs and longer hind limbs. Their canines are visibly longer compared to the incisors."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Wildebeest images!\nA wildebeest is a version of an antelope. They have horns whether they are male or female. While they are territorial, they are also known for being playful, energetic and active. Of all the antelopes in Africa, the wildebeest population has grown from 250,000 alive in 1960, and 1.5 million as of 2020.\nWildebeest Top Facts\nWildebeest are animals that can run as fast as 50mph\nThe two main species are blue wildebeest and black wildebeest\nTwo million wildebeest migrate every year\nWildebeest mate in groups of 150\nWildebeest Scientific Name\nWhile the common name for this animal is the Blue Wildebeest, its scientific name is Connochaetes taurinus. It is also referred to as a gnu (pronounced \u2018g-new\u2019). The class of animals it falls under is Mammalia and the family is called Bovidae. Its subfamily is Alcelaphinae. Though there are five subspecies of this animal, only two of its species still exist. The subspecies are albojubatus, cooksoni, johnstoni, mearnsi, and tauinus. The most common type of this animal is the Blue Wildebeest, who is related to the Black Wildebeest.\nIn African countries, the animal known as gnu was given the nickname of Wildebeest. In English, this translates to wild beast. In England in 1823, a naturalist named William John Burchell was the world\u2019s first to give a description to the Blue Wildebeest. The wildebeest\u2019s scientific name was formed using two Greek words that help describe the animal\u2019s physical appearance.\nWildebeest Appearance & Behavior\nThe Wildebeest is not properly proportioned. The animal has a heavy front end but its hindquarters and legs are skinny. The wildebeest has a head shaped like a rectangle, and broad shoulders. Its large muzzle matches the wideness of its forequarters, which include big muscles.\nNot every wildebeest is the same color. Some have a light gray brush while others are a color closer to blue-gray. The darkest wildebeests are a gray-brown color. On their shoulders are dark brown stripes that cross their body vertically. Wildebeest have a black mane, which is thick and long. They have a long beard on their neck, which can be dark or pale.\nWildebeests are animals that also have horns that curl away from their head. A male wildebeest has horns that are twice the size of a female wildebeest. For male wildebeest, the horns are 33 inches (half the height of the average refrigerator) and the female\u2019s horns are anywhere from 12 to 16 inches (or 30 times longer than an aspirin pill.) Their horns base will more rough as they age.\nThe blue wildebeest typically grows to a height of 4 1/2 feet, or 3 1/2 times taller than a bowling pin. They can also weigh as much as 600 pounds or roughly half the weight of a polar bear. They travel in herds of at least 1,000 when they travel for migration purposes.\nTheir habitat is one that Wildebeest roam freely while living near each other. They are very protective of their territory. It is not unusual for 270 of them to live in areas measuring one square kilometer.\nSometimes herds will stay in their territory while others will constantly be moving. However, every wildebeest rests at nighttime or when the air temperature is hot. The times of day they are the most active are all morning and into the early hours of the afternoon.\nApproximately 50% of a wildebeest\u2019s life is spent resting. 33% of their life is dedicated to grazing and 12% of it is spent interacting with other wildebeest.\nWildebeest Habitat\nWildebeest make their home in woodlands and grassy plains. They mostly live in various parts of Eastern Africa. This includes Kenya and Serengeti, Tazmania. In the southern part of Africa, Wildebeest live close to the South African Orange River. This animal prefers to live in the savannahs of Acacia. The grass grows quickly due to the moisture of the soil and is great for finding abundant grass to eat while grazing.\nThough wildebeest normally live with each other, they are also known to temporarily live with the zebras they encounter in the plains. This is because zebras will eat away the top layer of grass so that the wildebeest can get to what is underneath.\nWildebeest Diet\nDue to their diet, wildebeest are always traveling. They constantly look for water (which they drink twice per day) and grass. When the weather is dry they graze on fresh grass and then travel back home before the rainy season begins. At the end of the rainy season, they return to the area and graze again. Because the wildebeest has a wide mouth they are able to eat a lot of grass very quickly. When grass isn\u2019t freely growing, they search for shrubs and trees to eat.\nWildebeest Predators & Threats\nWildebeest are the most vulnerable to larger carnivores including:\nLions\nHyenas\nLeopards\nThe larger a wildebeest is the more vulnerable it is to its prey. To protect themselves, a group of wildebeest will come together and begin stomping the ground. They also let out loud calls to make sure the herd knows they are in danger.\nSomething else that threatens wildebeest is the fragmentation of their habitat. This happens if the grass they graze on is suddenly blocked with a fence. As agriculture and civilization continue to expand, and water sources continue to decline in certain areas, the lives of the world\u2019s wildebeest are being increasingly put at risk. As one example there are no longer and Wildebeest living in Malawi. Fortunately in Namibia, their population is rising.\nDespite some of these challenges, they are not at risk enough to be considered endangered. While the Serengeti has seen an increasing number of wildebeest in recent years, they have been slowly disappearing from other parts of the world. This is partly because they are competing with livestock for their necessities. Wildebeest are known for destroying the crops they find. As a result, farmers will often kill them and put up fencing to keep more from coming in. The only way wildebeest will be able to avoid extinction is through conservation efforts.\nReproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nWhen a male wildebeest is three or four years old they are ready to mate with females. To attract a female they secrete and expel feces into their territory. If a male tries to enter their territory the wildebeest will fight for it. If a female enters, he will try to mate with her. Female wildebeest are pregnant for 8 1/2 months before giving birth. The mating season is timed so that baby wildebeest are born during the rainy months of February and March. Of all pregnant wildebeest, 80% give birth to their babies over the span of two to three weeks, just in time for plenty of grass to be available to them. While similar animals give birth alone, a wildebeest may give birth with her herd surrounding her. Baby wildebeest are referred to as calves.\nOnce baby wildebeest are born it only takes a few minutes before they can stand up and run. They stay close to their mothers to avoid being eaten by animals such as hyenas, lions, cheetahs, and even wild dogs. For the first six months of his or her life, a baby wildebeest gets milk from its mother. When they reach 10 days old they can begin eating grass. As soon as a male wildebeest is one year old they are able to go off on their own. They then find other wildebeest to form a group with.\nIn the case of blue variety wildebeest, the males become ready to breed when they reach two years of age. Most female blue wildebeest can begin breeding after they have turned 16 months old when they have been properly nourished during their young life.\nSince they eat newly grown grass, the rate of success when mating is around 95%. It has been proven that the lunar cycle also has an effect on their breeding cycle. On nights with a full moon, males have a very high testosterone level. This means that their mating call is much stronger than it would be otherwise. Since males are more motivated to breed, females become the same way.\nThe average lifespan of female and male wildebeest means they will survive for 20 years. The oldest record age of any wildebeest is 40 years.\nPopulation\nAs many as 500,000 wildebeest are born between February and March each year. This is when the rainy season begins in its natural habitat.\nAs of 2018, the African population of wildebeest was approximately 1,550,000. They are continually being born at the Serengeti National Park, which is in Tanzania. Due to the growing number of wildebeest, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has the status of both the blue and black wildebeest as Least Concern (LC).\nView all 72 animals that start with W"}

Turns out, there\u2019s a lot of variation. Some animals are capable of running incredibly fast, while others are more moderate in their speed. Read on to learn more about average animal running speeds and some of the fastest creatures on Earth. You might be surprised by some of the results!\nElephant Speed:\nElephants are big animals. Surprisingly they can run fast and reach maximum speed up to 40 km/h, which is about 25 mph. In an average elephants can run 16 kmph (10 mph).\nElephant Average speed:55 km/h\nElephant top speed:64 km/h\nFor Example, The Borneo elephant is the largest subspecies of Asian elephant. it can reach speeds of up to 40 kilometers per hour, making it one of the fastest land animals on the island.\nJaguar Speed:\nThe Jaguar can run at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour in short bursts\nJaguar Average speed:80 km/h\nJaguar top speed:95 km/h\nTiger Speed:\nTigers are capable of running fast. Despite of their huge body weight they can reach maximum speed up to 65 km/h, which is about 40 mph. Tigers can leap about 30 to 33 ft in length.\nTiger top speed:65 km/h\nWolf Speed:\nHave you ever wondered how fast wolves can run? Wolves are typically known to be one of the most agile and fastest animals in the world. Surprisingly, their average running speed is about only 25 mph. This may not seem very fast to us humans, but for an animal that is typically around 50-80 pounds, this is pretty impressive! In order to understand just how fast a wolf can run, let\u2019s take a closer look at their anatomy and physiology.\nWolf Average speed:35 km/h\nWolf top speed:40 km/h\nHyena Speed:\nSpotted hyenas can run up to 43 mph (70 km/h), making them one of the fastest mammals in Africa.\n60 / 150\n70 / 150\nLion Speed:\nLion king of the jungle can reach maximum speed of 80 km/h however lasts only for few minutes. Hence Lion try to be close to their prey before they starting the attack.\nLion Average speed:60 km/h\nLion top speed:80 km/h\nRhino Speed:\nRhinoceros can run maximum speed about 56 kmph, considering huge body weight of rhinoceros this is very good speed. White rhinoceros run less speed than black rhinoceros. White rhinoceros can reach 50 kmph top speed. Rhinoceros can run faster than Elephants.\nRhino Average speed:40 km/h\nRhino top speed:56 km/h\nDeer Speed:\nDeer are the ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. The two main groups are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the fallow deer and the chital, and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer, the Western roe deer, and the Eurasian elk.\nDeer can reach maximum speed of 80 kmph.

Not to be confused with American bison, the African Buffalo is an animal that can adapt to a wide variety of habitats, runs up to 37 miles per hour and literally cannot be tamed. Over their roughly two-decade lifespan, they hang around in herds that \u201cvote,\u201d while grazing on lands that are increasingly threatened by human development.\nBuffalo top facts\nNo gentle giant: The buffalo\u2019s ornery nature and roughly 35 mile-per-hour top speed leads to numerous injuries and deaths every year, earning it the nickname \u201cblack death.\u201d Learn about the strongest animals in the world here.\nWho\u2019s the boss?: The base of the male buffalo\u2019s unique, curving horns grow to meet at the top of its head, forming a kind of helmet called a \u201cboss.\u201d\nHerd mentality: Buffalo herds use a kind of \u201cvote\u201d to decide which direction to move next!\nDistant family: Though all members of the family bovinae, \u201cbuffaloes\u201d are only from Africa and should not be confused with the American Bison or water \u201cbuffaloes!\u201d\nBuffalo scientific name\nThe scientific name for the African Buffalo is Syncerous Caffer. \u201cSyncerous\u201d is greek, meaning \u201ctop together,\u201d a reference to the large horn bases on the male buffalo that appear joined on the top of the head. \u201cCaffer\u201d comes from the Latin \u201cCountry of the Kaffirs,\u201d a reference to Africa as a whole.\nBuffalo appearance and behavior\nAll African buffalo are large and cattle-like animals, though they don\u2019t share a close genetic link to cattle. The males average 1,600 pounds as adults\u2013about as big as a four-wheeler! They also stand about five feet tall at the shoulder and reach as long as seven feet from nose to tail. Despite their size, a charging buffalo can reach up to 37 miles per hour.\nAfrican buffalo also have a terrible reputation for being ornery. Estimates vary, but deadly attacks by cape buffalo have earned it the nickname \u201cblack death.\u201d In one infamous case, an experienced South Africa-based hunting guide was killed by a buffalo\u2013a member of the same herd as a buffalo the guide, himself, had just shot. For this reason, trophy hunters have listed the African buffalo as one of the top five most dangerous (and, therefore, prized) creatures to hunt.\nDespite this reputation, research has also found herds of African buffalo to be somewhat democratic and altruistic. Herd movements, for example, undergo a kind of a \u201cvote\u201d where females lay in the direction they want to move, with the most popular direction becoming the one the herd moves next. Herds will also band together to protect calves from attacks. They\u2019ll even look out for other adults in the herd.\nAfrican buffaloes come in four varieties. These include the cape, West Africa savanna, Central Africa savanna and forest buffalo, and are mostly distinguished by their horn shape and relative size. The most common are the Cape buffalos, who have dark-brown coating of short, coarse fur and large, distinctive horns that curl downward and then back up, similar to a ram. Savanna buffalo are similar to Cape buffalo, but with slightly shorter horns and a wide range of fur styles ranging from light brown to virtual black. Forest buffalo are generally smaller than the others, with lighter brown (or even reddish) fur and shorter horns. Younger savanna buffalo sometimes have light brown fur as well, but most forest buffalo keep theirs into adulthood.\nBuffaloes are animals that congregate in large herds, with each herd featuring anywhere from 50 to 500 members. Sometimes herds will join to create temporary super-herds, numbering in the thousands, to keep lions and other predators from easily singling out single members for attack. Any herd is typically made up of females and their calves.\nMales will periodically form \u201cbachelor groups,\u201d smaller herds of adult males only. Even these herds, however, will separate into younger males and older males. The oldest males tend to prefer solitude.\nRelationship to other \u201cbuffaloes\u201d\nDespite similar names, African buffaloes are not the same as \u201cbuffaloes\u201d in other parts of the world. These include the water buffalo in Asia and the American bison, often called a \u201cbuffalo.\u201d It only takes a close look to see how much different bison are from buffaloes\u2013American bison have smaller, differently-shaped horns, thicker fur (often with a \u201cbeard!\u201d), a hump at the shoulders and a completely different head shape.\nWater buffalo, meanwhile, share a number of other features, but have some big differences. Unlike their African cousins, water buffalo are largely domesticated. This means they are used, specifically throughout China and India, similar to how cows and oxen are used in other parts of the world. Though African buffalo are sometimes hunted for meat, their unpredictable attitude has prevented them from ever being tamed. Almost all water buffaloes in the world are tamed, and virtually all African buffaloes are wild.\nBuffalo habitat\nAfrican buffalo can survive almost anywhere there is water. This includes swamps, semi-arid brushland and forests. They live throughout the continent of Africa, particularly central and southern Africa. Countries include Sierra Leone, Ghana, Cameroon, Kenya, Central African Republic, South Africa, Botswana and more.\nBuffalo diet\nDespite their sometimes violent nature, buffaloes don\u2019t eat meat. Like many hooved animals, they spend their waking moments grazing on plants. Though they only have a very distant evolutionary link to cows and other bovines, buffalo will chew cud just like a cow. That means, they will spit up grass from earlier to re-chew and extract more nutrients.\nUnlike other grazing animals, African buffalo graze mostly at night. They appear to do this, in part, because buffalo have a hard time regulating their body temperature.\nBuffalo predators and threats\nThough buffalo face a number of predators in the wild, their biggest threats are humans and food sources. Buffalo spend most of their day grazing, making them susceptible to starvation during droughts. Meanwhile, their prized status by hunters means there\u2019s no shortage of big game safaris that target them. Africa\u2019s natural hunters\u2013particularly, lions and packs of wild dogs\u2013pose a constant threat to buffalo that get separated from the herd.\nThe biggest threat to African buffalo, however, is irresponsible human development. Development, such as carving out cropland or clearing fields for housing and city expansion, cuts up the habitats of the buffalo, making it harder to find food. Since buffalo spend most of their day eating, this can quickly affect populations. It can also put humans at danger from buffalo, as buffalo tear up crops, knock down fences, and spread disease to livestock.\nBuffalo reproduction, babies, and lifespan\nThe African buffalo gives birth to approximately one calf every few years. Mothers remain pregnant for as much as a full year\u2013longer than humans, even! After giving birth, the calf will remain dependent on the mother for as much as another year. Though male buffalo will take no direct role in upbringing, the calves emit a specific cry that will bring all members of the herd to their rescue.\nAfter birth, calves take another four to five years to reach maturity. After maturing, females will typically remain with the herd where they were born, while males will leave for one of the \u201cbachelor\u201d herds. Females will typically begin having offspring around this time.\nIn the wild, buffaloes typically live for 10-22 years, while living almost 30 years in captivity.\nBuffalo population\nBuffaloes enjoy a healthy population throughout Africa, but numbers are declining. In the last decade, the International Union for the Conservation of Animals (IUCN) has changed the buffalo\u2019s status from \u201cLeast Concern\u201d to \u201cNear Threatened.\u201d This decline is attributed to farming practices that destroy their grazing lands, as well as threats from prize hunters and meat poachers.\nView all 184 animals that start with B"}

From its tear-streaked face to its spotted coat, this lanky and athletic big cat has mastered camouflage. It has a body engineered to race through the grasslands to take down prey.\nUnlike other big cats, cheetahs aren't always solitary and they never roar. In fact, they sound more like your friendly house cat and are even known to meow and purr. Explore the most interesting facts about this well-known speedster.\n1. Cheetahs Are the World\u2019s Fastest Land Mammal\nCheetahs are able to go from zero to 60 miles per hour (97 kph) in just three seconds. When racing at full speed, they cover about 21 feet (6 to 7 meters) with each stride. Their feet only touch the ground about twice during each stride, according to the Cheetah Conservation Fund. After a chase, the cheetah needs about 30 minutes to catch its breath before eating. Cheetahs tend to limit chases to distances of less than 1,000 feet, since running fast creates more body heat than can be released through evaporative cooling, i.e. panting and sweating through their paws.\nIn 2012, 11-year-old cheetah Sarah from the Cincinnati Zoo broke her previous record, covering 100 meters at a peak speed of 61 mph (98 kph) in 5.95 seconds. Olympian Usain Bolt, who holds the (human) world record, is much slower by comparison: 100 meters in 9.58 seconds.\n2. They\u2019re Built for Speed\nCheetahs use their muscular, flat tails to help them steer and balance when they run. Freder / Getty Images\nCheetahs' incredible speed is a product of their body mechanics. They have a flexible spine that allows them to stretch and cover so much ground on each stride. Their long legs help them race fast and move over great distances. The cheetah also has a muscular, flat tail that functions almost like a boat\u2019s rudder, helping them stay balanced and changed direction. Their semi-retractable claws act like cleats, helping the big cat gain traction when running, and their hard paw pads function like rubber on a tire. They have larger-than-usual nostrils to increase the flow of oxygen, and their large lungs and heart circulate blood very efficiently through their body.\n3. Cheetahs Don\u2019t Roar, They Meow and Purr\nThere\u2019s nothing scary about the noises a cheetah makes. Unlike lions, which are known for their ferocious roars, cheetahs sound more like your average house cat. They meow and purr. They also make chirps and churring sounds. Listen to some of the chatty cheetahs from the Toronto Zoo.\nThere are four big cats that roar: lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars. They are able to make their intimidating noises because they have a ligament instead of the epihyal bone in the voice box. The ligament stretches, creating lower sounds. Cheetahs have a fixed voice box with divided vocal cords. Like \u201csmall cats,\u201d it allows them to purr but limits the noises they can make.\n4. They\u2019re Racing Toward Extinction\nWhen cheetah habitat and prey dwindles, they occasionally will hunt livestock. 1001slide / Getty Images\nThere were more than 100,000 cheetahs in 1900, but now there are fewer than 7,000 adult and adolescent cheetahs in the wild. Cheetahs are classified as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, and they\u2019re listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.\nCheetahs face threats from habitat loss, conflicts with humans, illegal trade, and reproductive issues due to their limited genetic diversity. All of the cheetahs today appear highly inbred. When humans encroach on their territory, the big cats run out of space and run out of prey. That forces them to venture into farms and pasture, looking to livestock herds for food.\nThis isn't the first time that the cheetah population has been so precarious and scientists have worried that the species could go extinct. The big cat has faced two historic bottleneck events that drastically reduced its population size, according to a 2017 report in the Journal of Heredity. One event occurred 100,000 years ago and another about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. In both instances, the population was greatly reduced, leaving the remaining cheetahs with potentially harmful mutations and a much smaller gene pool.\nInterestingly, when cubs are born in protected regions like national parks or wildlife reserves, they tend to be geographically closer to large predators than if they're born in unprotected regions. This can increase cub mortality rates to as high as 90%.\n5. Their Eyes Help Them Hunt\nDark tear lines that run from a cheetah's eyes deflect the sun and help them hunt. Richard Goluch / 500px / Getty Images\nUnlike most other big cats, cheetahs hunt in the daytime, generally in the early morning or late afternoon. They climb a termite mound or small hill and use their sharp vision to locate prey, then it's off to the races. The cheetah uses its lightning speed to go careening after its dinner, knocking the prey to the ground and then latching on to its throat. They tend to eat their prey right away to avoid losing it to competitors.\nCheetahs have distinctive dark tear-mark lines that run from the corners of their eyes down to their mouth. These marks deflect the sun, making it easier for the cats to hunt during the day. Without the sun's glare, they're able to zero in on their targets, according to the Cheetah Conservation Fund.\n6. They Have Natural Camouflage\nCheetah cubs have long bristles of hair, called mantles, that help them hide in the grass. Delta Images / Getty Images\nCheetahs have spotted coats, which help them blend in with their surroundings. That not only helps them hide when they are stalking prey, but it also keeps them safe from predators, points out the National Zoo. The spots aren\u2019t just fur-deep; their skin has black spots.\nIn addition to spots, cheetah cubs have what looks like a full-body mohawk. Called a mantle, this long bristle of hair runs from their neck down their back to the base of their tail. The Cheetah Conservation Fund explains that the mantle makes cubs look like honey badgers and helps them blend into tall grass. This camouflage protects them from predators like hyenas and lions.\n7. Their Social Life Is a Mixed Bag\nMale cheetah siblings often live in groups called coalitions. AatishPatel / Getty Images\nExcept lions, which live in groups called prides, most big cats are relatively solitary animals. They prefer to be on their own except when mating or raising their young. Cheetahs are \u201cneither solitary nor social but are a little of both,\u201d says the San Diego Zoo.\nFemale cheetahs are mostly solo creatures. They only pair up to mate and then stick with their cubs while they are raising them. Their home ranges tend to be larger than males'. Males are usually solitary, but brothers will often live in groups called coalitions. Cheetahs hunt by themselves and avoid skirmishes except when fighting over mates.\n8. Cheetahs Love Fast Food and Don't Drink Much\nCheetahs prey on animals like gazelles and rabbits. Erlend Krumsvik / EyeEm / Getty Images\nCheetahs are carnivores that dine on small animals they can easily chase and kill. That includes smaller antelopes like Thomson\u2019s gazelles and springboks, as well as rabbits, porcupines, and ground-dwelling birds, reports the San Diego Zoo. They eat the meat quickly before more aggressive predators like leopards, lions, baboons, jackals, and hyenas come upon their dinner and force them to give it up. They can even get chased away by vultures. Although cheetahs are fast, they\u2019re not strong or aggressive enough to drag their meals very far away or guard them from these fierce competitors. Cheetahs only need to drink water every three or four days."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Killer Whale Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Killer-whale-facts.html", "text": "killer whale Facts\nPortrait of a Killer Whale\nThe killer whale is actually the largest member of the dolphin or delphinedae family, which is over 35 different species of toothed whales, including the bottlenose dolphin.\nMost of the largest dolphin species are referred to simply as whales, including pilot whales and of course killer whales, also known as orcas.\nKiller whales are fully aquatic mammals that spend their entire lives underwater. They only need to breath air from the surface once every 5 to 10 minutes using the blow hole at the top of their heads which is like a large nostril.\nThey are found in all of the oceans of the world, and are populous even in the colder waters of the Arctic and Antarctic oceans.\nThe killer whale, or orca, is highly intelligent and extremely social. Killer whales live in family groups called \"pods\" which consist of adult males and females and calves of various ages. Pods usually include between 6 and 30 individuals, but like the bottlenose dolphin, the killer whales social structure is complicated, and pods may come together forming groups of over 200 whales, within which all the individuals recognize and socialize with each other.\nSocial contact and interaction are critical to all whale species, and the killer whale craves stimulation from its family, peers, and close friends.\nOrcas are massive animals with males as large as 30 ft long (the largest recorded was a male measuring 32 feet long and weighing over 22,000 pounds) and require up to 500 pounds of food a day.\nThey are completely carnivorous and consume amazing amounts of small fish such as herring, larger fish like tuna and sharks, and marine mammals like seals, and even polar bears.\nPods of killer whales work together and use multiple techniques to hunt and will use their powerful tails called \"flukes\" as weapons. The term \"killer\" whale is probably due to the fact that pods of killer whales will hunt together and kill other whale species as well, including blue whales as large as 70 feet in length.\nWhales don't have gills and can't breathe underwater. They do not breathe at all when submerged, and when they surface they must make a conscious effort to take a breath.\nBecause their breathing is not automatic, only one hemisphere of the whales brain goes to sleep at a time, the other half stays awake, with one eye open, to take in a breath every 5 minutes or so.\nKiller whales have huge brains that are designed very differently from our own. Not only does their brain include entire regions that ours do not, but the areas of the brain known to encompass emotional thought and response are larger, percentage wise, in the brain of the killer whale than in any other animal.- Killer Whale Facts.\nthe killer whale and sense of self\nThere has long been the perception that a \"sense of self\" is a uniquely human experience. Recent work with primates, whales and elephants however, suggest that they too, have a sense of self.\nIn the simplest test, animals faces or heads are marked, and their reaction to their reflection in a mirror subsequently observed.\nOur brilliant and wonderful domestic dogs do not pass this test, but the great apes, the elephants and the dolphins do.\nBeyond what that may suggest, is another sense that many believe exists only in whales and dolphins. It is sometimes referred to as a \"distributed\" sense of self, and suggests that all the whales in a pod, and in particular within their matrilineal family unit, have a combined \"self\" so closely connected emotionally, that the physical state of one affects all.\nThis may be a the reason behind the otherwise complete mystery of mass strandings and beachings, where entire pods of seemingly healthy whales swim out of the water, cast themselves ashore, and ultimately die.\nA clearer connection researchers can point to are the numerous examples of perfectly healthy adult male killer whales under long-term observation in wild pods, who simply stop eating and die immediately after their mother has passed away.\nThe possibility that whales may have a sense of self beyond that of an individual is also suggested in how they interact when traveling, how they react when an individual is detained, attacked, or missing, and their reluctance, or even refusal to remove themselves from danger in certain situations.\nThis behavior is what allowed for the capture of entire pods of whales during the 1960's and 70's.\nThere is no \"scatter\" response that one sees with rodents and carnivores, but more a \"herding\" response, with a strong sense of staying together when danger is near.\nIt is believed that whales were once land animals, probably similar to ungulids like cows and camels, and when evolution brought them back to the sea, their herding instinct didn't just migrate with them, it became super-sized.\nThe sleeping behavior of killer whales gives hints of this. The members of the pod will form a tight circle, and their breathing and movements will synchronize. In unison they take several breaths at the surface, and then submerge for a period of time before surfacing again.\nThe time spent submerged increases as the \"sleep\" becomes deeper, but the movements are always in unison. Pods resting like this will avoid boats as a unit during this process while half of their brains are asleep.\nThe cohesion is astounding and unlike anything in the animal kingdom.\nWhales have entire structures in their brains that do not exist in any land mammal. Some of these are adaptions to sea life, some are very specifically related to their emotional state, and may be the concrete physical testimonial to suggestions of a higher conscious state, or a \"distributed\" sense of self among whales.\nSee more about the curious brain structure of the killer whale further down this page under the heading \"How Intelligent are Killer Whales?\" - Killer Whale Facts\norcas in action\nkiller whale lifestyle and reproduction\nkiller whale mother and baby\norca mother and calf\nAlthough the killer whale is currently recognized as one species, there is a tremendous variation in lifestyle among the population. Some whale pods are permanent residents in their territory. Resident pods have strong family bonds that are matrilineal in form, meaning a females offspring remain with her for life, and the offspring of her female young the same.\nMales stay in their mothers pod and help raise the young within that family, but only mate with females outside the pod. This keeps the gene pool vibrant.\nThe second form is the transient pod. These whales travel in smaller groups and the family bond is less powerful. They are transient not just in territory but in group dynamic, and individuals of this type of whale have more of a \"fission-fusion\" lifestyle, with ever changing group dynamics.\nThe most striking thing about the transient whales is the difference in diet from that of the resident pods. Transient whales eat almost exclusively marine mammals as opposed to the largely fish diet of the residents. Seal, walrus, sea lion, and even polar bear are on the menu.\nThese whales hunt in unison and have been observed creating waves to disrupt animals on ice floes, beaching themselves to snare sea lions, and hunting like a wolf pack to kill and devour creatures as gigantic as blue whales.\nThe third type is the offshore pod. This is a group of which little is known due to the fact that they live far offshore and hunt schools of fish in deep water.\nThe offshore killer whales have been seen in huge pods of up to 200 individuals. The whales themselves are smaller than the other types, and seem to be the most genetically different.\nFemale killer whales are poly-estrus and become sexually active when they reach about 14 years old. They are promiscuous and have relationships with multiple partners.\nkiller whale moms and babies\nThe pregnancy lasts about 17 months and produces one calf. The calf is usually born tail first, and must move quickly to the surface to take its first breaths. It is very active almost immediately and swims close to its mothers flank where she can draft the baby along in her wake, known as a \"slipstream\". This also keeps the baby in an ideal position to nurse, which it must do while on the move. The entire pod assists in the well being of the calf.\nBaby whales learn their mothers dialect very slowly and begin to speak the specific language of their pod, It takes two years before a youngster has a full repertoire of vocalizations.\nAs they mature, males will venture away from their family pod for rendezvous with females from other families, but they always return, and the resident killer whales family unit is one of the most constant and stable in the animal kingdom. - Killer Whale Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The question is why?\nScientists have debated for years on this subject, suggesting that leaping dolphins or whales are clearing parasites off of their bodies, looking around for flocks of seagulls that might indicate a school of fish in the distance, or announcing their presence to those nearby.\nGiven these animals astounding intellect, maybe they are just enjoying the thrill of exertion, engaging in sport as you or I might if our bodies allowed.\nMaybe its just fun! -Killer Whale Facts\nwhale songs and echolocation\nAll dolphins and whales have a blow hole at the top of the head through which they breathe air from the surface. The blow hole is effectively a single nostril. Within the blow hole are delicate folds of skin known as \"phonic lips\" that create all the different clicks that whales use to communicate.\nThe whistle sounds are produced by the larynx - so whales can create more than one sound at a time. Whales have distinct voices, calls and languages, and communicate with sounds at some frequencies that can't be detected by the human ear.\nThey chatter constantly among themselves and each pod communicates with a different dialect - a distinct set of sounds that are markedly unique.\nHowever when they talk to other pods they use a more communal language. When listening to recorded \"conversations\" of different pods of whales, even people who have no familiarity with whale calls can easily distinguish between the pods.\nTo put this in perspective - imagine all the dogs on Maple Street speak to each other exclusively with howls, the dogs on Oak Street talk to each other with growls, and the dogs on Poplar Street talk to each other with traditional barks.\nNow imagine that when a dog from Maple street runs into a dog from Poplar Street they speak to each other by whining.\nAs bright as we know dogs are, we can use them to demonstrate the difference between animals using \"calls\" and the fact that whales use language.\nKiller whales that are separated by great distances have completely different dialects. When analyzing Icelandic and Norwegian killer whale pods, researchers were able to distinguish 24 different calls made by the Icelandic population and 23 different calls made by the Norwegian whales, yet the two populations did not share any of the same calls.\nWhales even have different \"singing\" voices from their everyday \"speaking\" voices. Almost like having a \"phone voice\".\nIn addition to the sounds they use to communicate with each other, whales use clicks to \"echo locate\" as bats do. They send clicking sounds out and can gauge an objects size and distance by the echoes that bounce off of it. This is how whales find their way around in deeper waters where there is little light. -Killer Whale Facts\nhow intelligent is a killer whale?\nKiller whales kept in captivity have given us great insight into their intelligence. Killer whales can understand hand signals, vocal cues, and symbols on flashcards. Experiments have shown that they recognize themselves in mirrors and even have some understanding of numbers.\nWithout hands and opposable thumbs, whales have been observed making and using tools in the wild. A particular family of Dolphins has been observed wrapping pieces of sponge around their noses to protect them while they forage on the rough sea floor.\nNew mother whales have even been recorded using unique sounds when communicating with their offspring that they never use in communication with adult whales.\nIs it \"baby talk\"? Well, that would certainly seem to be an emotional conclusion to draw from that information, but considering the results of MRI scans on the brains of killer whales, it might not be far off.\nWithin the brain, neurologists believe the area called the limbic system is responsible for the processing of all emotions. A whales brain contains an extra lobe of tissue immediately adjacent to their limbic system and neocortex\nNamed the paralimbic lobe, it is a massive brain structure that human beings do not possess. The paralimbic lobe is an outgrowth of the very areas of the brain that are known to control communication and social emotions in all other mammals.\nIt is entirely possible, based on the fact that whales have an entire structure in the emotional regions of the brain that no other mammals have, that they experience feelings, social connections and emotions such as love, grief and joy on a level that human beings can't even imagine. - Killer Whale Facts\nthe blackfish-seaworld controversy\nTillikum at Seaworld\nWhales are so complex, emotional and clearly intelligent, that even the thought of holding them in captivity should not be considered.\nThe recent documentary \"Blackfish\" goes into detail about the unfortunate circumstances under which killer whales are held captive and forced to perform tricks in order to get fed.\nIt focuses on a massive male killer whale named Tilikum, displayed as \"Shamu\" at Seaworld. This one captive whale has murdered three separate human beings.\nHoused in concrete pools, separated from family members, often separated from their children, killer whales held in captivity have endured so much mental anguish on a daily basis that many of them simply loose their minds.\nLiving a life enslaved, devoid of all of the pleasures available to wild whales - the freedom to travel for miles at a time without encountering a concrete wall, the joy of socializing with dozens of friends and family members, the thrill of hunting and choosing meals, the experience of a normal sex life, all deprived, some of these animals simply go insane.\nSeveral trainers have lost their lives to whales that have lost their minds in captivity, dozens more have been injured as whales strike out in vain.\nWhat we should realize most is that these trainers, no matter their motivation, are the captors, and killer whales like Tilikum are the captive, forlorn and ultimately helpless.\nThere has never been any record of a killer whale in the wild causing the death of a human being. -Killer Whale Facts\na few more killer whale facts\norca underwater\nThe killer whale is a actually the largest species of dolphin.\nKiller whales stick their heads straight out of the water and inspect the world above the sea in an activity called \"spyhopping\"\nKiller whales are also known as \"orcas\" and by Inuit communities as \"blackfish\"\nThe killer whales top speed is almost 35 mph\nKiller whales sleep with 1/2 their brain at a time!\nThe whale has a structure in its brain to process emotions that no other animal has - including human beings\nKiller whales may actually be several different species\nThe killer whale is one of the few animals to be born tail first - Killer Whale Facts.\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnamalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Cetacea\nSub-Order Odontoceti\nFamily Delphinidae\nGenus Orcinus\nSpecies orca (killer whale)\nKiller Whale Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD pod all world oceans ocean fish, seal ENEMIES TAIL WIDTH AVG.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Zebra Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Zebra-facts.html", "text": "zebra Facts\nA glorious fixture of the African landscape, the zebra is a very flashy member of the normally mousy-colored horse family. Sporting a robust body of bold stripes, the zebra spends its busy life on the move seeking the best grazing in the mostly dusty world of the African savanna.\nBecause its skin is dark, many experts suggest that the zebra is a black (sometimes brown) furred animal with white stripes, while others will argue that the zebra has black stripes on a white field, pointing out the animals white undersides.\nNo matter, the effect is dazzling, and provides this gregarious herd animal with a confusing defense of fluctuating dark and light motion. When a group of zebras rumbles passed a lion, leopard or cheetah, it is virtually impossible for the predator to pick out just one individual target. For the zebra, as is the case with many herd animals, there is great security in numbers.\nThere are 3 main species of zebra. The most familiar are the plains zebras of which there are 5 subspecies each with slight variations in not only stripe pattern but color as well, some being decidedly brown instead of black. Of these, the Grant's, a hearty animal true, bold black and white stripes that grow wider as they reach the rump, is the classic zebra in type.\nAlthough there are some more populous sub-species, and interbreeding occurs, the Grants remains one of the most iconic sights on the African plains. The mountain zebras consist of 2 subspecies most easily distinguished by the fishbone pattern across the top of the rump. Mountain zebras also have a dewlap - a flap of loose skin at the throat, the function of which is unclear.\nFinally, the Grevy's zebra is in its own sub genus and is more donkey-like. It has thinner more numerous, and closely spaced stripes, often brown in color.\nAll the zebra species are herd animals, highly social and dependent on the camouflaging effect of a mass of striped bodies for survival. Constantly moving, always alert for danger, zebras have surprisingly good eyesight, and it is believed that, despite being monochrome themselves, they actually see the world around them in full color. - Zebra Facts\nWhy does a zebra have stripes?\nEven at the edge of a watering hole there is danger, but zebras love a crowd. The herd instinct draws them together, the exquisite skin often keeps them in one piece in more ways than one.\nImagine a crouching lion or hidden crocodile trying to select just one target in a dazzling sea of stripes. For well-camouflaged animals such as the zebra, it is more often movement and not the outline of a form that attracts the predator to an individual. A stilted gait, the bobbing head that comes with a lame leg, a stumble, a hesitation, the curtain of healthy companions rush away and the target is revealed.\nBut despite being every bodies favorite meal, the plains zebra is an extraordinarily successful animal, and though nature channels are rife with scenes of tragic endings, the majority of zebras lead long lives of 15 to 20 years. Even with territories dwindling as human-kind encroaches, the plains zebra herds are over 3/4 of a million animals strong. - Zebra Facts\nzebra reproduction\nZebra mothers and foals\nThe very social zebra requires the safety and comfort of a herd to survive. Two types of zebra herds exist, one being made up of a \"harem\" of females and their foals escorted by 1 stallion, the other being a \"bachelor herd\" of males who are either too young, too old, or too timid to gather a harem of their own.\nStallions are males at least 5 years of age who have fought with other males for the right to accompany and mate with the females in the harem. The females have a hierarchy and will often walk in line in the order in which they joined the group.\nThe senior mare will make most of the decisions for the herd, leading them to pastures and watering holes. The stallion will bring up the rear or patrol the flanks on the lookout for predators and other males who might steal his mares away.\nPregnancy lasts for a year and the newborn struggles to its feet in a matter of minutes. The skull of a newborn zebra is less than 1/2 the length of its mothers, but the babies legs are 95% the length of hers.\nSpeed really matters in the perilous world of a baby zebra and within moments of birth the infant is on its feet and ready to run, keeping to the center of the herd as much as possible and dodging the large hungry jaws of cheetahs, hyenas, lions and crocodiles on a daily basis. The mother does the parenting and will nurse the foal for up to 18 months.\nYoung males will leave the herd at between 1 and 2 years of age to join a herd of bachelors. Likewise, young females will leave when they come into their first estrus joining with a new dominant male who has chased away all suitors.\nBecause both the males and the females leave their original herd, the harems that are formed are actually groups of unrelated females who form strong bonds and live together as a family, usually their entire adult lives. - Zebra Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

When a bachelor herd approaches a \"super herd\" the stallions greet them as a unit and work together to fight them off.\nWhen the battles are over the stallions will return to their own harems. Within the \"super herd\" the harem structure remains intact with each mare remaining devoted to only her stallion, and each stallion keeping to his own mares. - Zebra Facts\nzebra identification guide - a tale of some tushies\nLook to the rear when trying to identify a zebra species or subspecies.\nOur first example is the broad black stripes of the famous Grant's zebra (the rare Selous zebra is similar).\nSecond: The 2-toned \"shadow\" stripes, and sometimes stripe- less legs of the Burchell's. (the Chapman's and Crawshay's zebras are similar)\nThird: The Grevy's has narrow, close-set, often brown lines, a prominent dorsal stripe with white outline and plush dark dorsal hair. The stripes do not go under the belly.\nFourth: The \"fish bone\", or \"gridiron\" pattern across the top of the rump of the mountain zebra. The mountain zebra tends to have the biggest variation in stripe width across the body (see small inset photo) with narrow, close-set stripes on the ribs changing abruptly to broad, wide-set stripes on the sides of the buttocks. Stripes do not go under the belly. Without a top view you can usually still identify the mountain zebra from the side- look for the tips of the fish bones! -Zebra Fact\nwhich zebra is this?\nSo which zebra species is the mother/son duo in the photo to the left? Yes! - A Grevy's zebra mare and foal.\ngrant's zebra\nBeefy build, thick neck, big, broad, black stripes it is the Grant's zebra. A mother and baby Grant's zebra in glorious black and white! Just look at the length of that foals legs - baby you were born to run!.\nBurchell's zebra\nIf the zebra has the Grant's sturdy build, but thinner two-toned stripes it is one of three subspecies. The Burchell's zebra, the Chapman's zebra and the Crawshay's zebras occasionally inter-breed and make positive identification tricky, but of the three, the Burchell's is the most common. In fact, the Burchell's is the most populous of all the zebra species. This is most likely a Burchell's zebra mare and foal. - Zebra Facts!\na few more zebra facts\nContrary to some claims, zebras, like all other equines, identify each other by smell and vocalization, not by their stripes.\nThe zebras stripes make it more difficult for predators to target one individual out of the herd.\nAlbino zebras occasionally occur in the wild. Often called \"golden zebras\" they are not true albinos, but have pale tan or golden stripes and light brown or even blue eyes."}

They also live in social groups called \u201cprides,\u201d which give them the protection of numbers. When they are threatened while feeding by a large group of predators, such as spotted hyenas, they sometimes protect themselves by yielding and allowing the hyenas to steal the kill.\nBecause of their size and strength, adult lions have no natural predators. Lions usually dominate smaller predators, such as leopards, cheetahs, hyenas and wild dogs. Lions often steal these predators\u2019 kills and sometimes even prey on their young. Lions are more likely to die violently when fighting with other lions or when hunted by humans. Although lions venturing into water have been known to be attacked and overcome by crocodiles, lions sometimes kill crocodiles on land.\nPrides of lions consist of several females, their cubs and a few males. Although female lionesses do most of the hunting due to their swiftness and agility, male lions are better able to defend the pride due to their size and powerful build. Male lions spend much of their time on guard, observing and marking the pride\u2019s territory. When the pride is threatened, some lions advance to meet the intruder while others remain behind and guard the cubs.\nADVERTISEMENT"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Mountain Lion | National Wildlife Federation", "url": "https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/Mountain-Lion", "text": "The mountain lion\u2014also known as the cougar, puma, panther, or catamount\u2014is a large cat species native to the Americas. Mountain lions are large, tan cats. Their bodies are mainly covered in tawny-beige fur, except for the whitish-gray belly and chest. Black markings decorate the tip of the tail, ears, and around the snout. Mountain lions vary hugely in average body size depending on geographic location\u2014their size is smallest closer to the equator and largest closer to the poles. Generally, though, males weigh between 115 and 220 pounds (52 and 100 kilograms) and females weigh between 64 and 141 pounds (29 and 64 kilograms).\nThe mountain lion\u2019s range spreads all across the Americas, from the Canadian Yukon to The Strait of Magellan, the greatest of range of any living mammal in the Americas. Mountain lions inhabit a wide range of ecosystems, making their home anywhere there is shelter and prey, including mountains, forests, deserts, and wetlands. They are territorial and have naturally low population densities, which means the species requires large swaths of wilderness habitat to thrive.\nMountain lions are stealthy predators, hunting at night and often lying in wait for prey or silently stalking it before pouncing from behind and delivering a lethal bite to the spinal cord. Typically they prey on deer, but also feed on smaller animals, even insects, when necessary. Like all cats, mountain lions are strict carnivores, and they only rarely consume vegetation.\nMountain lions can breed year-round. Female mountain lions usually give birth every two years. Litters can range in size from one to six cubs. The young may stay with their mother for as long as 26 months, but usually separate after about 15 months. In the wild, a mountain lion can live up to 10 years. In captivity, they can live up to 21 years.\nConservation\nThe historic range of the mountain lion included almost all of North and South America. The species was so wide-reaching and populous that it had multiple subspecies that varied based on location. Throughout the 1800s and early 1900s, people feared the mountain lion because it posed a risk to their livestock. The species was maliciously hunted and almost eradicated from the eastern United States. Due to conservation efforts, mountain lion populations in the western United States are stable, although far lower than they were historically. While there are still several thousand mountain lions in the wild, their population has significantly decreased from their historical population due to unsustainable hunting, habitat destruction, and conflicts with livestock.\nMountain lions are an \"umbrella species\" for conservation because their conservation depends on the preservation of large amounts of habitat. A mountain lion usually requires about 13 times as much area as a black bear or 40 times as much area as a bobcat to thrive. By preserving enough wilderness to support a stable mountain lion population, countless other species of plants and animals that share mountain lion habitat benefit.\nThe eastern cougar, a subspecies of mountain lion, was declared officially extinct by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service in 2011, although individuals from western populations have been confirmed to wander as far as the East Coast. Florida panthers, the other U.S. subspecies of mountain lion, are listed as critically endangered on the endangered species list. There are less than 160 Florida panthers left in the wild.\nLearn more about our work through our Save LA Cougars campaign."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Southwest African Lion Facts: Animals of Africa - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://mail.worldatlas.com/articles/southwest-african-lion-facts-animals-of-africa.html", "text": "4. Physical Description\nThe Southwest African Lion is one of the largest lion subspecies to be found today. Their bodies and fur tend to be of a singular color, lacking the rosettes and stripes common among tigers, leopards, and jaguars. The color of their mane is affected by their testosterone levels, and it starts out lighter among young cubs and subsequently darkens as they mature. Fully matured adult males are usually around 8.2 to 9.8 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) long. The females are a bit smaller, at 7.5 to 8.5 feet (2.3 to 2.6 meters). Male cubs average around 170 pounds (77 kilograms) in weight, and females tend to weigh 20% less than males. Adult male weights around 309-534 pounds (140-242 kilograms) while the females weigh between 231 and 375 pounds (105 and 170 kilograms). They have a shoulder height of around 3 to 4 feet (0.9-1.2 meters) when standing on all fours.\n3. Diet\nThe Southwest African Lion is obligatory carnivorous. Their diet consists of other large animals sharing their habitats, such as zebras, warthogs, antelopes, and wildebeests. They are coordinated hunters and hunt in packs. Male lions do not hunt, and instead watch the cubs while the lionesses are hunting. Lions hunt by encircling herds of prey and rushing its weakest members, maintaining a bite on their neck until eventually strangling them. Despite that, they are usually content to scavenge, preferring to eat dead animals already killed by other predators and natural events. They do so by watching the skies for vultures circling around to find carrion to eat. Lions do not have much stamina, and are better sprinters than endurance runners. To combat this, they try to sneak around or hunt during night to secure their prey in surprise attacks.\n2. Habitat and Range\nThis subspecies of lion is endemic to Southwest Africa. It is found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Namibia, the western sections of Zambia and Zimbabwe, and the northern regions of Botswana. The United States has classified this and other African Lion species as endangered. They received global media attention in 2015 after an American dentist went on a hunt and killed a well-known Southwest African Lion, named \u201cCecil the Lion\u201d, in Zimbabwe. While not under the immediate threat of extinction, their population has been dwindling since the early 1980s. Their habitat is being encroached upon by nearby human land development, and human hunting keeps their natural prey at levels unsustainable to support the lions\u2019 dietary requirements.\n1. Behavior\nSouthwest African Lions are social creatures. They create group called \u201cprides\u201d, with the female lions (\u201clionesses\u201d) as the mainstay authoritarians of the groups. Lionesses are hostile to other lionesses outside their pride. Membership status within a pride is generally constant and stable, only changing once a lead lioness dies. They are territorial, with the males constantly patrolling their pride area for intruders. Large prey that are killed are dragged back to the pride area are shared with the other group members. Despite such social cohesion, members of a pride are often aggressive with one other. While consuming their prey, each lion tries to eat as much as possible in a race against the others."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "What Animals Eat Lions? - Grunge.com", "url": "https://www.grunge.com/164025/what-animals-eat-lions/", "text": "What Animals Eat Lions?\nLions occupy a penthouse suite atop the food chain, overlooking the animal kingdom like a regal beacon of doom. They are incredible hunters, able to pull off feats like downing 1,000 pound Cape Town buffalo, according to The Smithsonian, then gorging on up to 70 pounds of flesh in one sitting. But do any animals commit regular regicide against the king of the jungle?\nWell, they aren't totally invincible, and there are multiple species with the potential of switching off a lion's \"mane\" life force. This will usually occur if a lion bites off more than it can chew \u2014 but not because there are any rougher, tougher predators looking to snack on lions. Reference.com says lions can die attacking animals like crocodiles, sable antelopes, or \u2014 heaven forbid \u2013- a hippo. Now, crocodiles are obviously dangerous, and hippos have a reputation for being more dangerous than anything else, but antelopes? According to the article, when wounded, a sable antelope will drop to its knees and gore its would-be attacker, its horns revealing an inconvenient truth straight to the heart of an unlucky lion. However, those odds aren't too high, and that's about all of the wildlife that poses a real threat to a lion.\nIn theory, any scavenger might feed upon a lion after it's dead, but the only true remaining lion killer is us humans. Specifically, the Maasai tribe has long been known for its rite of passage lion hunting, according to the Washington Post, which required a young man to kill a lion to become a warrior.\nHowever, due to low remaining lion numbers, the Post article proclaims that even the Maasai have chosen conservation over tradition, choosing to prove manhood through Olympics-style competition instead. Besides, the Maasai tribe doesn't eat game meat, meaning there simply aren't any animals alive today that naturally consume lions. That's good, because \u2014 as we've mentioned \u2014 there aren't many lions left.\nJust over a century ago, there were as many as 200,000 lions in the wild. Now, there are only about 20,000 wild lions according to Mother Nature Network, but thanks to the forward-thinking nature of the Maasai, they stand a better chance. So long as gun-toting dinguses don't go slaying for the 'gram and we preserve their fast-shrinking habitat, lions will be around for a while yet."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Hyrax Facts: Animals of Africa - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/hyrax-facts-animals-of-africa.html", "text": "Africa is famed for its diverse and unique wildlife. Although the \u201cbig five\u201d animals are the famous residents (lions, leopards, buffalos, elephants, and rhinos), there are many other animals who, while being secretive and small, are critical to the ecosystem.\nOne of such animals is the hyrax. Hyrax is a name given to small rodent-like animals under the order of Hyracoidea. While their small stature, as well as diet, resembles that of rodents, scientific studies show that the hyrax is surprisingly related to the elephant and sea cows (manatees and dugongs).\nHyraxes are classified into four distinct species, the Procavia capensis (rock hyrax), Heterohyrax brucei (yellow-spotted rock hyrax), Dendrohyrax arboreaus (southern tree hyrax), and the Dendrohyrax dorsalis (western tree hyrax). Hyraxes, as is the case with all African wild animals, are faced with the increased threat of extinction due to human activities. While human hunting of hyraxes is minimal, the prime threat to their existence is the destruction of their natural habitat by human activity.\n4. Behavior\nHyraxes are active during both the daytime and night, and can be seen foraging near pitch darkness, a behavior attributed to their excellent sense of smell as well as excellent hearing. Hyraxes are social animals and live in groups of up to 50 individuals. Such groups are usually headed by a male and a few subordinate males with the female hyraxes being the majority. The territorial male is usually on the lookout while the other members are feeding and will sound an alarm after it detects any threat in the environment. The hyraxes in these groups communicate with one another through a complex variety of sounds.\nAnimals who prey on hyraxes include leopards, pythons, birds of prey and serval cats. Their primary defensive response is biting and clawing the predator. Hyraxes are rather impressive in their toilet manners as they usually have a defined location used for defecation away from their shelter crevasse. The hyrax reaches sexual maturity at the age of 17 months where females mate with the dominant male. The female hyrax has a gestation period of seven to eight months (which is rather long for an animal of its size) after which it gives birth to a litter of four youngsters who spend the most of their childhood in the safety of the crevasses. After reaching adulthood, male hyraxes are banished from their home territory and spend their solitary lives in the margins of established territories.\n3. Habitat and Range\nHyraxes are found all over the continent of Africa as well as the Middle East. However, these small mammals are likely to be found in areas with rocky terrain because the hyraxes do not dig burrows and so look for crevasses in rocks or hollow trees to reside in. They particularly look for crevasses which are small enough to hinder predators from accessing them or their young. When choosing a location to establish a habitat, the biggest factor they take into account is the area\u2019s visibility and temperature. Another reason why hyraxes prefer rocky areas are that hyraxes are fond of basking on rocks where they live so as to control their body temperature. However, hyraxes can be found in many other diverse habitats and can even be found in tundra climates at altitudes of over 14,000 feet above sea level\n2. Diet\nHyraxes primarily feed on shrubs, twigs, and grasses with a preference for fruits, shoots, berries, and buds. The animals use their excellent climbing skills to access the fresh and soft parts of trees and bushes. However, hyraxes have been observed feeding on birds\u2019 eggs, lizards, and insects which means the animals can most accurately be classified as omnivores. Mosses and liverworts are usually consumed by hyraxes. Initially, hyraxes were wrongfully considered to be ruminants (animals who chew regurgitated cud) due to their jaw motion while chewing.\nHowever, hyraxes are not ruminants and instead rely on their complex, multi-chambered stomach which has a host of bacteria to break down the fibrous plant matter. Hyraxes use their molar teeth to cut off leaves instead of their incisors which resemble tusks. The hyraxes obtain moisture from the plants they feed on and hence can go extended periods of time without drinking water. While feeding, hyraxes are cautious and will look for threats after every bite if living alone, and if living as a group, an individual will be on the lookout for predators while the others feed.\n1. Physical Description\nHyraxes are small animals without tails. They resemble guinea pigs. The animals grow to 28 inches in length and have a maximum weight of 11 pounds. The hyrax\u2019s skin is covered with thick fur and has varied coloration depending on the species. The yellow-spotted rock hyrax\u2019s fur is yellowish brown and has a white patch just above its eyes. The rock hyrax is greyish-brown in color and has no distinct marks on its face.\nThe hyrax has several physical attributes that differentiate it from rodents and link it to elephants and manatees. The hyrax\u2019s feet have rubber-like moist soles which are crucial in climbing. Hyraxes have three toes on the hind feet and four toes on the front feet. The toes have nails (with the exception of the hind foot\u2019s inner toe which has a claw used for scratching itches) which resemble hoofs unlike the usual long, claw-like nails found in rodents. The dental characteristics of the hyrax are also close to that of elephants with elongated incisors which resemble tusks found in manatees and elephants. These tusk-like teeth are more prominent in male hyraxes than in females."}

The details of animal mating can be titillating, amusing, and just plain weird, all at the same time.\nMale Alligators Have Permanent Erections BirdImages / Getty Images Penises vary widely across the animal kingdom, but a universal theme is that this organ changes size or shape before or during the act of mating, then reverts to its \"usual\" configuration. That's not so for alligators. The males are endowed with permanently erect penises, layered with numerous coats of the stiff protein collagen, that lurk inside their cloacas (chambers that contain digestive and reproductive organs), then burst out suddenly like the baby alien from John Hurt's stomach in \"Alien.\" The six-inch-long penis of an alligator isn't everted, or turned outward, by muscles, but by the application of pressure on its abdominal cavity, clearly an essential bit of reptilian foreplay.\nFemale Kangaroos Have Three Vaginas Tom Brakefield / Getty Images Female kangaroos (all marsupials, for that matter) possess three vaginal tubes but only one vaginal opening, eliminating any confusion on the part of their mates. When males inseminate females, their sperm travels up either (or both) of the side tubes, and about 30 days later the tiny joey travels down the central tube, from which it slowly makes its way to its mother's pouch for the remainder of its gestation.\nAntechinus Males Copulate Themselves to Death Wikimedia Commons The antechinus, a tiny, mouselike marsupial of Australia, would be almost anonymous except for one odd fact: During their brief mating season, the males of this genus copulate with females for up to 12 hours straight, stripping their bodies of vital proteins in the process and dismantling their immune systems. Shortly afterward, the exhausted males drop dead, and the females go on to bear litters with mixed paternity (different babies have different fathers). The moms live a bit longer to nurture their young, but they usually die within the year, having had the opportunity to breed only once.\nFlatworms Fence With Their Sex Organs Wikimedia Commons Flatworms are among the simplest invertebrate animals on earth, lacking well-defined circulatory and respiratory organs and eating and pooping via the same body opening. But all bets are off during mating season: The hermaphroditic critters, which possess male and female sex organs, sprout pairs of dagger-like appendages and fence in slow motion until a \"hit\" is scored, straight into the other's skin. The \"loser\" is impregnated with sperm and becomes the mother, while the \"father\" often goes on dueling until it becomes a mother itself, further complicating the confused gender roles.\nMale Porcupines Urinate on Females Before Sex Lisa Barrett / EyeEm / Getty Images Once a year, male porcupines cluster around available females, fighting, biting, and scratching one another for the right to mate. The winner then climbs onto a tree branch and urinates copiously on the female, which stimulates her to go into estrus. The rest is somewhat anticlimactic: The female folds back her quills so as not to impale her partner, and more routine insemination takes only a few seconds.\nBarnacles Have Enormous Penises Pramothy Chiy Di / EyeEm / Getty Images You might imagine that an animal that spends its entire life tethered to one spot has a relatively sedate sex life. In fact, though, barnacles (one shouldn't say \"male\" barnacles since these animals are hermaphroditic) are equipped with the largest penises, relative to their size, of any creatures on earth, as much as eight times longer than their bodies. Essentially, frisky barnacles unfurl their organs and attempt to fertilize every other barnacle in their immediate vicinity, at the same time, presumably, being probed and prodded themselves.\nMating Snails Stab Each Other With 'Love Darts' Wikimedia Commons Some hermaphroditic species of snails and slugs wield the invertebrate equivalent of Cupid's arrows\u2014sharp, narrow projectiles made of calcium or hard proteins\u2014as a preliminary to the act of mating. One of these \"love darts\" pokes into the receiving snail's skin, sometimes penetrating its internal organs, and introduces a chemical causing it to be more receptive to the attacking snail's sperm. These darts don't introduce sperm into the \"female's\" body; that happens the old-fashioned way, during the act of copulation.\nFemale Chickens Can Eject Unwanted Sperm Paula Sierra / Getty Images Female chickens, or hens, tend to be smaller than roosters and often can't resist less-than-desirable males insistent on mating. After the act, though, enraged or disappointed females can eject up to 80% of the offending male's sperm, allowing for the possibility that they might then be impregnated by roosters higher up in the pecking order.\nMale Honeybees Lose Their Penises While Mating Rene Nortje / EyeEm / Getty Images Everyone talks about colony collapse disorder, which is devastating bee populations worldwide, but not many people seem to care about the peculiar plight of the individual drone honeybee. Before a queen bee can assume her exalted title, she begins her life as a virgin bee and must be inseminated by a male to step up to the throne. That's where the unfortunate drone comes in: In the course of mating with the heir apparent, the male's penis rips off, still inserted into the female, and he flies off to die. Given the gruesome fate of male honeybees, it's no surprise that full-grown queens deliberately breed them for use in their \"mating yards.\"\nSheep Have a High Rate of Homosexuality Apostoli Rossella / Getty Images Homosexuality is an inherited biological trait in some members of the animal kingdom, and nowhere is homosexuality more rife than among male sheep. By some estimates, almost 10 percent of rams prefer to mate with other rams rather than females. Lest you think this is the unintended result of human husbandry, studies have shown that the behavior of these sheep is reflected in a specific area of their brains, the hypothalamus, and is a hard-wired rather than learned behavior.\nMale Anglerfish Merge With Females During Mating Wikimedia Commons Anglerfish, which lure their prey with fleshy structures growing from their heads, live in the deep ocean and are relatively scarce, producing a limited supply of available females. But nature finds a way: The males of some anglerfish species are orders of magnitude smaller than the opposite sex and literally attach themselves to, or \"parasitize,\" their mates, feeding them a constant supply of sperm. It's believed that this evolutionary trade-off allows the females to grow to \"normal\" sizes and thus prosper in the food chain. What happens to males who don't find receptive females? They die, sadly, and become fish food."}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion Facts - Wildlife Pictures Online", "url": "http://www.wildlife-pictures-online.com/lion-facts.html", "text": "SEE ALL\nWILDLIFE ARTICLES\nLion Facts and Information by Scotch Macaskill\nMale lion standing side-on in warm afternoon light, Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana Social Structure Lions (Panthera leo) are members of the true cat family (Felidae). They are also the only true social cats, living in prides that are based on a matriarchal social structure with females forming close, usually life-long bonds. Lion prides can comprise from around four to 40 members, of which more than half will be cubs or young adults, but the average size is about 15 lions. The pride usually consists of a few generations of related females, together with their cubs and one or more adults males who can defend the pride's territory and mate with the females. Each lion pride has a specific territory that it controls. The size of a territory can vary enormously, from 20 sq km to 400 sq km, depending mainly on the concentration of available prey. While young males are expelled from the pride by the age of three, females usually remain with the pride for their whole lives. Male lions do not look after the cubs in a pride and take no part in helping raising the young, but they do protect the whole pride against other males. Cubs are safe as long as their father is in charge of the pride. However, when a new male lion ousts the existing dominant male and takes over the pride, he normally kills any existing cubs. He does this because a female can have a litter only every two years if she raises her cubs to weaning. However, if she loses her cubs she comes into season within as little as four weeks. So it is to the male's advantage to ensure the females in the pride are available for procreation as soon as possible after he takes over, othewise he may in turn be displaced before producing his own cubs. Male lion siblings often stay together after being forced to leave the pride by the resident dominant males, usually when they reach 2\u00bd to 3 years old. They will then live a nomadic life as young bachelors until old and strong enough to compete for a territory of their own, where they will have the benefit of working as a team in challenging a pride's resident male or males. Physical Appearance Lion male with orange-brown coat Lion male with silvery-gray coat The lion has short, tawny hair, a paler underside and a long tail ending in a black tuft. The color of the lion's coat, which can vary from tan, orange-brown or even silvery gray to dark brown, is determined by the proportion of light hair to dark hair in the coat. Because adult male lions have manes, the lion is the only member of the cat family in which the males and females can be distinguished from each other by appearance. This of course does not apply to lion cubs, where baby males and females look the same.\nBaby lion cub with wooly, grayish coat Baby lion cubs have wooly, grayish coats with white spots on the lower parts, mainly the tummy and legs. Their coat changes to the more tawny color typical of adults at about three months and the white spots gradually fade with age, although in some lions the spots remain on their stomachs for their entire life. Of all the cats, lions have the strongest forequarters, which is why a lion can deliver such a deadly blow with a front paw - hard enough to break a large antelope's back. The front paws are bigger than the hind paws. The paws are fitted with strong, sharp claws that are normally sheathed when not in use, ensuring they remain protected and sharp. ** While you're here, please check out our extensive range of Wildlife T-shirts - featuring unique designs based on original wildlife photographs - now available from Amazon in the US and UK. Click below for more. ** Breeding A lioness becomes sexually receptive for two to four days about once every two years, provided she raises her cubs to weaning. Mating between lions occurs about four times an hour over a period of one to four days. The female may turn her attention to one of the other pride males when the first one is worn out. See Lions Mating for pictures & video. Pride males do not compete or fight to mate with a sexually receptive lioness as she will often mate with all of a pride's males in turn as each loses interest in her, so there is no reason to compete for her favors. Females within the same pride will often have cubs at more or less the same time. This means that some females can go out to hunt while other mothers stay at home to care for the cubs. Cubs have the best chance of survival when a number of litters are born almost simutaneously as such cubs can virtually be raised in a \"nursery\". Once a mother introduces her cubs to the rest of the pride when they're about two months old, it's possible that they can be suckled by any lactating females (called allo-suckling) as pride females suckle one another's cubs, with no bias towards their own. Thus one lioness may be seen suckling cubs of obviously differents sizes and ages. As males play no part in raising the cubs, providing food and training to hunt is the responsibility of the mother. Litters of up to six baby lions (but usually one to four) are born at any time of year after a gestation of 110 days. The mother initially conceals her cubs in dense cover or in a cave, away from the rest of the pride.\nLioness and cubs feeding on a warthog kill At birth baby lions weigh about 1kg (2.2lbs) and are completely helpless. Their eyes open after about 10 days and they can walk at 10 to 15 days and run at 25 to 30 days. The mother will only introduce them to the rest of the pride once they're one to two months old. Lion cubs are weaned at seven to nine months, but are unable to fend for themselves before they're 16 months old, although they start to eat meat at about three months. Cubs stay with their mothers for about two years, at which stage they're old enough to join the pride on hunting excursions. Hunting Lions are efficient predators that kill and feed on mammals like big and small antelope, wildebeest, zebras, and even larger mammals like giraffe and buffalo. To get within range of their prey, lions rely mainly on stalking and will seldom charge unless within 30 meters of the victim. When hunting larger animals, a lion usually attacks at an oblique angle before leaping and throwing one paw over the shoulder or rump and then using its weight and strength to pull down the quarry.\nLion pair showing difference in size Female lions do most of the hunting for the pride because the males, with their prominent manes and larger size, are more conspicuous and more easily spotted by potential prey. On group hunts, males will usually trail behind without taking part. However, once a prey is brought down, they soon arrive and force their way to the front of the line, eating their fill before allowing the females and cubs a turn. When more than one lion is at a kill, agression and noise are the norm. The more lions and the smaller the prey, the more intense the competition. Wild animals have to fight for a share of the spoils to survive. Males eat first, gorging themselves, and will on average eat 18kg (about 40lb) in one session, but can stuff themselves with nearly double that amount. Once they're done, it's the turn of the females to eat, with the cubs getting the leftovers. In times of food shortage, starvation is the major cause of lion cub deaths. Although this sounds cruel, it is better for the survival of the pride for a cub to starve than an adult female, which can not only hunt, but also breed again. that can be retracted when not in use, ensuring they remain protected and sharp. Lifespan The average lifespan of a male lion is 12 to 16 years, and for a female it is 15 to 18 years. See also Lion Information for more on lions, including their average size and weight.

In fact, each tiger's pattern of stripes is unique, making it possible to identify different individuals \u2013 a handy thing for conservationists trying to keep track of which tigers live where.\nAdvertisement\nThese impressive felines are one of the \u2018Big Cat\u2019 species and are actually the largest of the cat species, though the prize of the strongest bite (relative to size) belongs to the jaguar.\nHere is our expert guide to tigers, looking at key species facts, how they hunt and where they live in the wild.\nWhat is the scientific name of the tiger?\nThe scientific name of the tiger is Panthera tigris. It is one of five species in the Panthera genus, the others are: lion, jaguar, leopard and snow leopard. These five species are often referred to as the \u2018Big Cats\u2019, though sometimes other cat species such as the puma (also known as cougar or mountain lion) and the cheetah are also included in this group.\nThere are six extant (living) subspecies of tiger:\nAmur (P. t. altaica)\nSouth China (P. t. amoyensis)\nSumatran (P. t. sumatrae)\nIndochinese (P. t. corbetti )\n) Malayan (P. t. jacksoni)\nBengal (P. t. tigris)\nWhy do tigers have stripes?\nTigers are the only big cats to have stripes and individuals can be identified by their pattern.But when it comes to predatory adaptations, you wouldn\u2019t expect a coloration of bright orange with black stripes to be top of the list \u2013 in fact it might not be on the list at all.\nHowever, while we typically see tigers in zoos, conspicuous against the green vegetation in their enclosures, their main prey is ungulates, which cannot detect the range of colours that we primates can. To an animal with comparatively poor vision, the cat\u2019s bold, contrasting colours are much harder to pick out in the long grass.\nA Bengal tiger showing off his stripes in Bandhavgarh National Park, Madhya Pradesh, India. \u00a9 Art Wolfe/Getty Images\nThis method of camouflage is an important predatory adaptation. Whereas some large felines rely on co-operative hunting (such as lions) or bursts of intense speed (such as cheetahs), tigers are semi-solitary and depend on their cryptic appearance to ambush prey.\nWhat do tigers eat?\nTigers are carnivorous mammals, and they mostly eat large prey like deer, wild boar and even elephant calves. And yes, they have occasionally been known to kill and eat people, too. This usually only happens when a tiger is old, ill or injured, and therefore unable to catch their normal prey. But once a tiger has a taste for human meat, they often have to be killed to protect the local people.\nA tiger face would be pretty terrifying if you think it might be the last thing you'll ever see! \u00a9 Neosiam/Getty Images\nHow do tigers hunt?\nA tiger's favourite way of taking down its prey is to lunge at the animal's neck and hold on tight with its powerful jaws. The prey will normally die from suffocation, but some might bleed out first if the tiger's canines sever an artery.\nPlease note that external videos may contain ads:\nRare Tiger vs Boar Fight | BBC Earth\nIs the tiger the world's biggest cat?\nTigers are the biggest cat in the wild, yes. Male tigers can grow to be over 3m long and weigh up to 300kg, while female tigers tend to be a bit smaller.\nHowever, another big cat has been bred in captivity that's even larger. If you breed a male lion with a female tiger, you get a liger. These truly enormous cats have no equal in the modern world, growing up to 3.6m long and being considerably heavier than even the biggest tigers - the largest living cat, Hercules the liger, weighs close to 420kg, and the record is a staggering 550kg.\nLigers have a similar facial structure to lions but faint stripes like tigers. And they're bigger than both! \u00a9 Getty Images\nWhere do tigers live?\nTigers are relatively adaptable and historically lived across huge swathes of Asia. There are now very few left in South-East Asia, but they're doing relatively well in India, Nepal, Russia and Bhutan.\nTiger habitats vary by region, with the larger tigers of colder northern regions (like the Siberian tiger) living in the brutal taiga, while smaller tigers from warmer regions can happily live in arid forests, tropical rainforests and flooded swamplands and mangroves.\nResearchers think that India holds around half of the world's remaining wild tigers. There are several Indian national parks that are renowned for their frequent tiger sightings, including Bandhavgarh, Ranthambore and Kanha national parks.\nCan lions and tigers co-exist?\nIndia is the only country in the world that is currently home to both of these charismatic big cats, and history and biology say they can indeed co-exist. The felines\u2019 ranges overlapped for millennia across much of western Asia \u2013 in India, this was the case into the early 19th century.\nMuch as predators co-exist in Africa, tigers and lions can live together within carefully drawn boundaries. For example, they may use adjoining habitats, or the same habitats at different times. Behavioural adaptation is another strategy, particularly when it comes to hunting: tigers are largely\nkilling prey by ambush, while lions are social felids, hunting co-operatively with their prides.\nThe question of lions and tigers as neighbours is gaining importance in India. The Kuno Palpur Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh has been \u2018prepared\u2019 and is awaiting translocation of a number of Asiatic lions, which survive only in the greater Gir landscape in Gujarat, western India. In the meantime, tigers are moving into Kuno from the famous Ranthambhore Reserve, crossing rivers and ravines along the way.\nThis Q&A originally appeared in BBC Wildlife Magazine, and was answered by Prenrna Bindra.\nWhy do tigers have spots on their ears?\nTigers have white spots surrounded by black fur on the back of their ears. It has been suggested that they act as false eyes to warn of their presence or discourage other species from attacking them from behind. Other theories suggest that it helps tiger cubs follow their mother through tall grass.\nThe white spot on the back of a tiger's ear. \u00a9 Gary Ombler/Getty Images\nApex predators in the wild: which mammals are the most dangerous?

In tall grass, rock crevices or caves, tiger cubs are born blind and depend on their mother for protection. Females usually give birth to two to three cubs but can have as many as six.\nEach litter has a dominant cub who is more active than their siblings and takes the lead in their play. This sibling is usually the first to leave its mother.

Tigers in cold northern regions tend to have the largest territories. Scent marking allows tigers to communicate with other tigers in their range, and scratching posts are also useful communication tools, as well as helping to keep their claws sharp.\nSiberian tiger in a snowstorm. \u00a9 Tahir Abbas/Getty Images\nCan tigers see in the dark?\nTigers have night vision that is six times better than that of humans, which helps them hunt successfully in the dark. A tiger will mainly hunt pigs and deer but is capable of taking prey larger than itself.\nHow many tigers are left in the world?\nThe surviving tiger subspecies are the Siberian tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger, Malayan tiger and Bengal tiger. It is believed that between all of those subspecies, there are only 3,000 to 4,500 individuals left in the wild.\nThe Javan tiger and Bali tiger are sadly both thought to have been hunted to extinction. They were most closely related to the Sumatran tiger (and may have even been the same subspecies), which is still clinging on in Indonesia.\nWhy are tigers endangered?\nOne of the saddest facts about tigers is that land development has led to around 96% of the tiger\u2019s natural range being lost in the past 100 years.\nTigers are also being illegally hunted for their body parts such as bones, skin and teeth to fuel the growing demand for remedies made from tiger parts in Asia.\nSiberian tiger aka Amur tiger. \u00a9 Ibrahim Suha Derbent/Getty Images\nAre tigers kept in captivity outside zoos?\nAs well as being illegally poached in the wild, tigers can still be legally farmed for their body parts in China. International trade in tiger parts is banned, but it's a different story domestically, where there's high demand for luxury rugs, tiger skin accessories, tiger bone wine and traditional medicines (which have never been shown to work).\nAdvertisement\nMain image: A female Bengal tiger with cubs at the edge of a pool in Bandhavgarh National Park, Madhya Pradesh, India. \u00a9 James Warwick/Getty Images"}

Ibex are wild goats with cloven hoofs and very long horns that curve over their back. Males typically also have beards. The alpine ibex is the most common type, and the Asiatic ibex is generally considered a subspecies.\n4 Incredible Ibex Facts!\nThe animal\u2019s hooves work like suction cups to allow them to climb sheer cliffs\nThe Siberian ibex has the largest horns within the genus at 100 \u2013 148 cm\nMost males and females stay in gender-segregated herds for much of their life\nIbex herds stay close to \u201cescape terrain\u201d in tall cliffs\nIbex Scientific name\nThese animals belong to the genus Capra and the family Bovidae. It has a number of subspecies, including the following:\nCapra aegagrus aegagrus (Bezoar ibex)\nCapra ibex (alpine ibex)\nCapra nubiana (Nubian ibex)\nCapra walie (Walia ibex)\nCapra pyrenaica (Iberian ibex)\nCapra sibirica (Siberian or Asiatic ibex)\nCapra caucasica (West Caucasian ibex)\nCapra cylindricornis (East Caucasian ibex)\nThe alpine species is the most commonly referenced species. It is also known by the names of steinbock and bouquetin. The scientific name Capra means goat in Italian.\nIbex Appearance\nMost species of these animals have a brown or gray coat. The exact shade and thickness are determined by where they live. For example, the Nubian species have a shiny coat that reflects the sun and helps them keep cool. Nubian ibex are smaller than other species and have slimmer horns. The alpine ibex is a typical example of the species. Adult males weigh around 220 pounds and stand about three feet at the shoulder. Females are about four inches shorter and weigh about half as much at 110 pounds. Males have long horns that curl over their backs. The horns are strongly ridged on the front. Males also have beards.\nIbex Behavior\nThese animals typically socialize in gender-specific herds. This means that there are male herds and female herds. The male herds are often called bachelor herds. The two herds only meet up during breeding seasons. Sometimes, older males will wander alone without a herd. Female herds usually have 10 to 20 animals. The animal will usually flee from people, but if it\u2019s rutting season males can be particularly aggressive and might charge.\nIbex Habitat\nThese animals live primarily in high mountain regions and tall cliffs. These habitats make it difficult for predators to get to the animal. The Walia species lives in the highest reaches of the Ethiopian highlands at elevations of up to 14,800 feet. The Nubian ibex is found in the hills around the Red Sea and the Egyptian highlands. The alpine species is found mainly in the European Alps. They can be found in countries like France, Austria, Germany, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Italy, and Switzerland. The Iberian or Spanish ibex lives mainly in the southern Pyrenees on the Iberian Peninsula. It was previously found all through the Pyrenees and in the south of France. The Pyrenean ibex is a subspecies of the Iberian species, and it became extinct by the year 2000. The Pyrenean ibex was later cloned in 2009, but the specimen only lived for ten minutes.\nThe Siberian or Asiatic ibex is often considered a subspecies of the alpine species, but it may be a distinct species. It enjoys a wide distribution from Afghanistan to Mongolia. The animals are typically found at elevations as high as 5,300 meters above sea level. The Caucasian ibex is also known as the Caucasian tur, and it is found in the Caucasus.\nThe hoof structure of the animal makes it very nimble and skilled at climbing steep rocks. Despite living high in the mountains, they tend to avoid deep snow.\nIbex Diet\nAll of these animals are herbivores. They only eat vegetation like bushes, grasses, and shrubs. Vegetation high in the mountains tends to have low nutritional value, so the animal spends much of its day eating and grazing. Some of them will also climb into the lower branches of trees to eat leaves. As the animal avoids deep snow, they may come down from the steep elevations in the winter to find food. Herds tend to make sure that their range includes a dependable water source.\nIbex Predators and threats\nThe animal\u2019s best defense against predators is its ability to climb to steep heights. Very few predators can follow them up the steep cliffs and mountains. A threatened animal may rear on its hind legs and point its horns towards the threat. Young animals are susceptible to being carried off by large birds of prey such as eagles.\nAt the start of the 19th century, the animal\u2019s population was quickly dwindling. It was often hunted for superstitious reasons. A century of aggressive protection followed, and now many species of these animals are thriving. Currently, the only species near extinction are the Ethiopian and the Spanish ibex. The Pyrenean subspecies became extinct in the year 2000.\nWhat eats ibex?\nWolves, bears, leopards, lynxes and large birds of prey hunt and eat these animals.\nWhat does ibex eat?\nThese animals eat all manner of vegetation, including flowers, leaves, grass, shrubs, moss and twigs.\nIbex Reproduction and Life Cycle\nThe breeding season for these animals starts in late autumn to early winter. The males leave their bachelor herds to find females. Males often fight with other males to determine who can breed with the females. Despite the large horns of the animals, it\u2019s rare for males to sustain serious damage from fights. Once the female becomes pregnant, the gestation period is about six months. Most young are born around May. These animals usually have one kid per litter. It\u2019s possible for the ibex to have twins and even triplets, but the latter is very rare. Twins make up about 20% of births.\nThe babies are called kids, and they reach sexual maturity at about 18 months. They are often left alone when young to hide from predators. How long they stay alone depends on how quickly they pick up handling the terrain. The young usually stay with their mothers for at least a year. However, females do not reach their full body size until about five or six years of age, and males don\u2019t reach it until nine to 11 years. The animal\u2019s horns keep growing throughout their life.\nThese animals can live up to 20 years in the wild.\nIbex Population\nThe alpine ibex is now quite plentiful and over 30,000 individuals are thought to exist in the wild. On the other hand, the Walia species is thought to only have about 500 individuals left, which makes them endangered. The Iberian ibex is thought to have around 9,000 individuals in the wild. The Nubian species likely has about 10,000 mature animals left, and the population is decreasing, which gives it a vulnerable status according to the IUCN.\nView all 27 animals that start with I"}

Here are our top ten facts about zoos that you need to know...\n1. Zoos are miserable places for animals\nIn 2010, a Freedom for Animals undercover investigator filmed sick animals left untreated and dead animals to rot on floors at Tweddle Farm Zoo. Freedom for Animals had to take rabbits to a vet to have infections treated and after our expose local police confiscated a monkey who had been kept alone and given cake and other junk food to eat.\nThink safari parks are better than \u2018traditional\u2019 zoos? Woburn Safari Park was keeping its lions locked into small enclosures for 18 hours a day. A government zoo inspection report in 2010 said: \u201cThe animals were very crowded and there was no provision for individual feeding or sleeping areas. There was no visible environmental enrichment. Some of the lions exhibited skin wounds and multiple scars of various age, some fresh, some healed.\u201d\nIn late 2012, another safari park was shamed as West Midland Safari Park was exposed for providing white lion cubs to a notorious circus animal trainer, who sent them to a traveling circus in Japan. The Lions remain in the circus today.\nA government-funded study of elephants in UK zoos found \u201cthere was a welfare concern for every elephant in the UK.\u201d 75% of elephants were overweight and only 16% could walk normally, the remainder having various degrees of lameness. Less than 20% were totally free of foot problems.\n2. Zoos can\u2019t provide sufficient space\nZoos cannot provide the amount of space animals have in the wild. This is particularly the case for those species who roam larger distances in their natural habitat. Tigers and lions have around 18,000 times less space in zoos than they would in the wild. Polar bears have one million times less space.\n3. Animals suffer in zoos\nA government-funded study of elephants in UK zoos found that 54% of the elephants showed stereotypies (behavioural problems) during the daytime. One elephant observed during day and night stereotyped for 61% of a 24-hour period.\nLions in zoos spend 48% of their time pacing, a recognised sign of behavioural problems.\n4. Animals die prematurely in zoos\nAfrican elephants in the wild live more than three times as long as those kept in zoos. Even Asian elephants working in timber camps live longer than those born in zoos.\n40% of lion cubs die before one month of age. In the wild, only 30% of cubs are thought to die before they are six months old and at least a third of those deaths are due to factors which are absent in zoos, like predation.\n5. Surplus animals are killed\nA Freedom for Animals study found that at least 7,500 animals \u2013 and possibly as many as 200,000 \u2013 in European zoos are \u2018surplus\u2019 at any one time.\nAnimals are regularly \u2018culled\u2019 in UK zoos. In 2006 the whole pack of wolves at Highland Wildlife Park were killed after the social structure of the pack had broken down. In 2005 two wolf cubs and an adult female were shot dead at Dartmoor Wildlife Park. The vet reported: \u201cSelective cull due to overcrowding and fighting in the pack\u201d and \u201cFurther cull of cubs needed\u201d. In 2001 a DEFRA zoo inspection of Dartmoor Wildlife Park in October 2001 found that \u201cseveral significant dead animals\u201d were stored in a food freezer \u201cfor taxidermy in the future\u201d.\nThe European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) said in 2007 that member zoos were being actively encouraged to kill unwanted animals, including tigers, if other zoos did not want them and if they were hybrids. It said that such animals take up space and keeper time.\nIn 2010, zoo trade bodies rallied to the defence of a German zoo which was prosecuted for breaching animal welfare laws after it killed three tiger cubs because they were not pure-blooded (hybrid).\nIn 2011, an expos\u00e9 of Knowsley Safari Park led by Freedom for Animals following information provided by a whistleblower showed the safari park to be in contravention of legislation on disposal of carcasses as well as raising queries over handling of firearms. A former employee of the safari park alleged: \u201cculling was being used as a means of training instead of being carried out in the kindest and most humane way.\u201d\nIn early 2014, there was global outrage when Copenhagen Zoo killed a healthy young giraffe called Marius. The event triggered a worldwide debate on culling in zoos and it was admitted by zoo spokespeople that thousands of healthy animals are deliberately killed in European zoos alone each year.\n6. UK zoos are connected to animal circuses\nFreedom for Animals exposed a UK zoo in 2009 that was a member of the trade body BIAZA (which supposedly upholds the highest standards) as having a breeding connection with a controversial animal circus. Noah\u2019s Ark Zoo Farm had been breeding camels from the Great British Circus for several years and in 2009 obtained three tigers from the circus.\nA female tiger at the zoo had three stillborn cubs and another who died at three weeks old. The mother also died.\nThe same zoo was found to doing business with another circus animal trainer in 2013. This was the same trainer who had been sold lion cubs by West Midland Safari Park and sent them to a traveling circus in Japan.\n7. Animals are trained to perform tricks\nMany zoos train animals to perform tricks as if they were in a circus. Performing sea lions, birds and elephants can be seen at many UK zoos.\nSome training of elephants has been done using electric goads. Freedom for Animals infiltrated a training session held at Blackpool Zoo in 1998 and filmed elephants being trained to lift their feet and head, hold sticks in their mouths and jabbed with elephant hooks in the shoulder and head.\nIn 2010 it was revealed that an elephant at Woburn Safari Park had previously been trained using an electric goad .\nBlackpool Zoo proudly publicised its training of a baby sea lion for shows in mid 2013 . This is in spite of the fact that the UK Government has agreed to ban similar shows in circuses on the basis that: \u201cwe should feel duty-bound to recognise that wild animals have intrinsic value, and respect their inherent wildness and its implications for their treatment\u201d.\n8. Animals are still taken from the wild\nIn 2003 the UK government gave permission for the capture of 146 penguins from a British territory in the South Atlantic (Tristan da Cunha). Those who survived the seven-day boat journey from Tristan to a wildlife dealer in South Africa were sold to zoos in Asia .\nIn 2010, Zimbabwe planned to capture two of every mammal species found in Hwange National Park and send them to North Korean zoos. This included rhinos, lions, cheetahs, zebras and giraffes as well as two 18-month-old elephants. The plan was only stopped after international pressure by a coalition of organisations including Freedom for Animals.\n70% of elephants in European zoos were taken from the wild .\nA Freedom for Animals study found that 79% of all animals in UK aquariums were caught in the wild. Sea Life aquariums admitted to taking animals from the wild as recently as 2013, but refused to provide information on how many of the animals held by them were wild-caught.\n9. Zoos don\u2019t serve conservation\nZoos claim to breed animals for eventual release to the wild but breeding programmes are primarily to ensure a captive population, not for reintroduction.\nLions are popular in zoos, but the vast majority \u201care \u2018generic\u2019 animals of hybrid or unknown subspecific status, and therefore of little or no value in conservation terms .\nZoo director David Hancocks said: \u201cThere is a commonly held misconception that zoos are not only saving wild animals from extinction but also reintroducing them to their wild habitats. The confusion stems from many sources, all of them zoo-based\u2026 In reality, most zoos have had no contact of any kind with any reintroduction program.\u201d\nCaptive breeding is considered by some conservation scientists to be a diversion from the reasons for a species\u2019 decline, giving \u201ca false impression that a species is safe so that destruction of habitat and wild populations can proceed\u201d.\nZoos spend millions on keeping animals confined, while natural habitats are destroyed and animals killed as there is insufficient funding for protection. When London Zoo spent \u00a35.3 million on a new gorilla enclosure, the chief consultant to the UN Great Ape Survival Project said he was uneasy at the mismatch between lavish spending at zoos and the scarcity of resources available for conserving threatened species in the wild.\n\u201cFive million pounds for three gorillas when national parks are seeing that number killed every day for want of some Land Rovers and trained men and anti-poaching patrols. It must be very frustrating for the warden of a national park to see\u201d.\nMeasures to protect giant pandas\u2019 habitat also supports hundreds of species of mammals, at least 200 birds, dozens of reptiles and over half of the plants known to exist in China .\nIn 2013, Freedom for Animals revealed that the UK\u2019s largest aquarium operator, Sea Life, could trace less than 3 pence per visitor to in situ conservation projects.\n10. Zoos fail education\nA Freedom for Animals study of UK aquariums found that 41% of the animals on display had no signs identifying their species \u2013 the most basic of information.\nA US study found no compelling evidence for the claim that zoos and aquariums promote attitude change, education, or interest in conservation in visitors. The study authors urged zoos to stop citing a zoo-funded study which claimed an educational benefit from visits \u201cas this conclusion is unwarranted and potentially misleading to consumers.\u201d\nIn 2010, a Government-commissioned study found that \u201cConcerns remain, however, with regard to the lack of available evidence about the effectiveness\u201d of conservation and education projects in zoos.\nAnimals in zoos are suffering.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Xerus images!\nA Xerus uses its fluffy tail as shade from the sunlight in Africa.\nXerus erythropus which is commonly known as African ground squirrel and is native to Africa. They have coarse and short hair and are known to be social animals. They can survive in captivity for about 11.5 years.\nThe males and females live in their separate groups and come together to mate after which the babies live with their mothers in the group of females.\nThe Xerus has four subspecies \u2013 cape ground squirrel, striped ground squirrel, mountain ground squirrel, and unstriped ground squirrel.\nThese animals are diurnal and are usually known to be herbivores in nature and usually eat nuts, roots, and seeds. However, sometimes they also eat eggs and other small animals.\n5 Amazing Xerus Facts\nMature male Xerus are animals that like to form their own groups, which are separate from the females. These groups often consist of about 20 members each.\nThese squirrels are not known to hide food like other squirrels. Instead, they go out hunting for food daily and don\u2019t keep steady storage.\nThey don\u2019t live in trees, creating more comfortable habitats in burrows in the desert.\nThese squirrels mate throughout the year, rather than during a single season. The males and females have multiple mating partners.\nThe female Xerus live in groups of one to four with their babies, also known as pups.\nXerus Scientific Name\nCommonly known as the Xerus, these animals go by the scientific name of Xerus erythropus and belong to the family Sciuridae and phylum Chordate. They come from the Mammalia animal class.\nThe Xerus has four subspecies. The first, the cape ground squirrel (scientific name: Xerus inauris), primarily lives in South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia, seeking out drier areas to call home. The striped ground squirrel (scientific name: Xerus erythropus), however, is found primarily in the southwestern area of Morocco, Mauritania, and Senegal.\nThe mountain ground squirrel (scientific name: Xerus Princeps) lives in the western region of South Africa and Namibia, as well as the southwestern side of Angola. Finally, the unstriped ground squirrel (scientific name: Xerus rutilus) can be found in the grasslands, woodlands, and rocky areas of the northeastern areas of both Sudan and Tanzania.\nXerus Appearance and Behavior\nThese squirrels are covered in fur from head to toe which is often the light-brownish color of the soil. However, it can also be found in reddish-grey or yellowish-grey fur. However, their feet have relatively lesser hair than the rest of their bodies. While the pads of their feet have minimum to no hair, the foot itself has some hair.\nIn the case of the striped ground squirrel, the body has a white stripe running on both sides and shoulders. The tail is usually flat and is a darker shade than the body fur. The ears of the animal are usually small and the claws are long and curved. However, these claws do not allow the creature to climb trees.\nTheir height can be anywhere between 17 to 18 inches, excluding the tail. The tail is about 7.5 to 10.2 inches long, making it approximately one-third of the Xerus\u2019 full length. However, the size of the squirrel usually and mostly depends on the subspecies in question as all four could have some differences.\nThey usually weigh about 14 ounces. These squirrels use their tails as protection from the scorching heat.\nThe Xerus is known to be a social animal who lives in groups. Adult males form their groups that have around 19 to 20 members each. Females, on the other hand, usually live in a group of one to four along with their offspring.\nClose-up of Xerus eating a seed\nXerus Habitat\nThe Xerus are known to live in open areas, especially woodland, desert, or grassland. However, they can be found throughout Africa. One of the subspecies even makes its home in rocky regions, including the mountains.\nWhile they are terrestrial, their diurnal habits allow them to explore much of the area that they reside in for food.\nThough many other squirrels and similar animals are known to live in trees, Xerus make their home in burrows instead. To find any of these animals in the wild, check out certain areas of the desert in South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, and Botswana. The squirrels are not known to migrate, so the odds of seeing one are fairly high.\nXerus Diet\nXerus dines on a variety of foods like nuts, roots, and seeds. The cape ground squirrel particularly likes shrubs and bulbs as well. They also will consume yams, cotton, cassava, peanuts, and sweet potatoes when they find them. Though the Xerus is primarily an herbivore, there are several animal-based sources of protein that they will seek out during their diurnal treks for food. When available and needed, their diet will also consist of insects, eggs, and small animals (in small amounts).\nXerus Predators and Threats\nLike all the other animals, Xerus also eat and are eaten by other living creatures, holding their own in the food chain. The largest threat to the life of Xerus is the jackal, though the black-backed jackal seeks it out the most. Xerus is also pursued by snakes, lizards, and the puff adder.\nXerus is known to be a fast animal, which is necessary to beat the animals that prey on them. However, it is unclear how quickly that they may move, since their quick sprints are often short-lived.\nOn another front, the industrial activities that humans carry out also pose a threat to the lives of Xerus as it may lead to the degeneration of their natural habitat. The Xerus population is plenty around the globe and the IUCN has declared it as \u201cnot extinct.\u201d\nXerus Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nThere is no known breeding period in the case of Xerus. However, the male and female Xerus mate throughout the year despite having only single mating partners. It is said that they sometimes give birth through July and October. The gestation period in Xerus is about 48 days after which the young ones are weaned for about 52 days.\nFemale Xerus reach sexual maturity at 10 months of age while the sexual maturity in males usually happens when they are eight months old. The female Xerus can breed all year long, but very few of them produce more than one little annually. Usually, females produce about one to three babies per litter.\nThe babies that are called pups are born hairless, with their eyes closed. They are known to open their eyes around 35 days of age and are looked after by their mothers for about 45 days. The pups are known to reach adulthood at about 150 to 153 days.\nWhile in captivity, the Xerus can survive up to 11.5 years, but there are no known records of their lifespan in the wild.\nXerus Population\nVery little is known about the population of these animals. However, there are enough African ground squirrels and the IUCN has declared them as \u2018not extinct\u2019.\nView all 3 animals that start with X"}

They live in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their populations are endangered, especially outside of Africa.\nYou can identify most leopards by their light color and distinctive dark spots. Those spots are called rosettes, because they resemble the shape of a rose. These patterns camouflage their bodies as they move through the grass and trees. Black leopards, which appear to be almost solid in color because their spots are hard to distinguish, are commonly called black panthers.\nUnlike lions, leopards are solitary creatures. Males are almost entirely solitary and females only break their solitude when they are raising cubs. But, like lions, leopards roar. Male leopards defend their territory by roaring and scent marking, while females use their roar to attract mates and call their cubs. A leopard roar is a rough rasp, like a handsaw cutting wood.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nLeopard cubs are born with barely visible spots. The mother hides her cubs and moves them from one safe location to the next until they are old enough to begin playing and learning to hunt.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Skunk Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Skunk-facts.html", "text": "skunk Facts\nPortrait of a Skunk\nThe skunk is a small, well-furred carnivore about the size of a house cat. It has iconic black and white markings, and the most notorious defense mechanism in the animal kingdom - the power of stench.\nOnce considered a member of the mustelid, or weasel family, which includes badgers and otters, skunks are now classified, since 1997, in their own family Mephitidae from the word \"mephitical\" meaning \"noxious vapor\". The new family includes 10 species of American skunks, and 2 species of old world animals called \"stink badgers\", which are native to Indonesia.\nOne of the Americas most recognizable animals is the striped skunk. Striped skunks are as wide-spread as any species in North America, and can be found in every state in the contiguos United States.\nStriped skunks are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active at dusk and dawn, and they spend most of their time digging and hunting for insects, grubs, mice, rats, and just about anything else they encounter.\nThey will eat fruits or vegetables occasionally, human garbage happily, and unattended dog and cat food too.\nMost skunks are black and white in color, although brown is not uncommon, and albino individuals occur as well. Dramatic stripes or spots across the coat serve as a warning for predators to stay away, and for the most part, they do.\nOnly inexperienced animals will push the limits of a little skunk, and the skunk will give lots of warning if they are being harassed. Skunks will hiss, do little bluff-charges, stamp their feet, and, last but not least, do handstands while whisking their tails violently.\nIf the aggressor doesn't heed the warnings, the skunk finally faces it's raised tail towards the offender and releases a 10 foot stream of sulfuric anal juices. Like tear gas, the skunks anal secretions not only wreak, but also burn the eyes and mucous membranes of unfortunate victims.\nMost animals, be they mountain lions, bear cubs or young coyotes, once sprayed, will never risk contact with a skunk again, and the skunks dramatic coloring makes it easy for their victims to remember them and avoid them in the future.\nThe only creature that preys on them regularly is the great horned owl, which, somehow, is not deterred by the odor or the stinging sensations. Many domestic dogs and cats though, for whatever reason, just don't seem to learn their lesson, some making a lifetime habit of getting \"skunked\".\nWhile a bath in tomato juice is often used to try to remove the odor, the actual remedy is a mixture of baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and liquid detergent - it's supposed to do the trick!\nAlthough they try to avoid confrontation with humans, pets and predators, skunks are carnivorous hunters, possessing large sharp teeth and extremely long, curved claws.\nThey are generally helpful animals, ridding farms and suburban neighborhoods of all sorts of unwanted vermin, but can be destructive to lawns, sheds and the lower perimeters of homes as they dig and rip in search of grubs and mice.\nFor this reason, more than any other, the idea that skunks can make nice house pets is a challenged one. Skunks have been bred since the 1950's for the pet trade, and are offered for sale after having their anal glands surgically removed.\nPet skunks come in an assortment of colors beyond the classic black and white, with shades of lavender, apricot, cinnamon and champagne being most popular.\nWith their large, grape-sized anal glands removed, pet skunks can no longer spray, but they have other, smaller glands, located under their chins and throughout their bodies, that produce a musky odor, much like a ferret.\nThe issue of the musky smell comes down to personal tolerance, but the real concern with pet skunks is that their natural drive to dig and forage, usually leads to destruction of household items, furnishings, and fairly important things like flooring, drywall, and moldings.\nWith its strong shoulders, back, and forelimbs specially designed for digging, and claws like little steel tire-irons, a curious skunk can rip a baseboard loose in seconds, and even tear up ceramic tile.\nYes, skunks are cute, and more cuddly then you might expect, but investigate thoroughly before considering one as a pet!\nskunk spray\nMost carnivores, including domestic dogs and cats, have anal glands. These are glands located on either side of the anus that create an oily, sulfuric substance with a powerful smell.\nThe secretions of the anal glands are stored in anal sacs, and when the animal has a bowel movement, some of the substance escapes onto the excrement, leaving a specific calling card of odors for any animals that follow.\nDogs greet each other by sniffing the anal glands. Other animals, such as badgers and mongooses, mark territory by pressing their rears against logs, stones, and other badgers.\nBut skunks use their anal glands as a weapon.\nHow these organs have evolved into such an amazing defense mechanism is unclear, but the skunks ability to project their sulfuric spray as far as 15 feet, aimed directly at the intended target, is unique, and truly amazing.\nWhen ready to spray, two bright red nozzles project out of the anus, and a noxious, oily, golden stream of stink is hurled, with remarkable accuracy, directly at the intended target.\nSkunks have precise control over these nozzles. If they can't see their target, in heavy brush for instance, they may expel more of a mist to cover a larger area, but if the harassing party is visible, the skunk will aim for the eyes, with a powerful sulfur spray that lands in thick, rain-sized drops.\nskunk sprayers close-up!!\nSkunk spray is an entire recipe of chemicals, with seven volatile ingredients including a sulfur based thiol common in garlic and onions. The spray itself is extremely flammable, and the components are slightly different from species to species, to the point where experts can tell from the odor which species produced the stench.\nLike being exposed to teargas, the victim may experience extreme discomfort, pain, difficulty breathing, and even temporary blindness. The odor will remain on hair, clothing, fur, skin and surroundings for days to weeks, and can be smelled from over a mile away.\nThe skunks two grape-sized anal glands contain a total of about 4 tablespoons of fluid, and most is expelled in a full-on event. It can take several days to replenish them, so skunks do not spray randomly, because without this remarkable line of defense, they would be relatively helpless against the large predators they encounter.\nBut whether their arsenal is depleted or not, they still go about their business with a bit of a brazen attitude, assuming they won't be pestered.\nFor this reason, it is the automobile, not the cougar or grizzly bear, that is the number one killer of skunks in North America. Folks who have accidentally hit a skunk on the road, occasionally report the animal raising its tail and spraying instead of running out of the way of the on-coming 3,000 pound vehicle, and we've all experienced that moment driving down the highway, when everyone hits the window buttons and covers their nose. - Amazing Skunk Facts\nskunk lifestyle\nSkunks are solitary animals that sleep in nests or burrows during the day, and forage and hunt during the night. They are most active at dusk and dawn, making fairly regular rounds across their range, which is usually about 1 square mile.\nSkunks are not territorial, and are not aggressive towards other skunks, except for mild skirmishes over food or den sites. These encounters are usually bluff sessions, rarely ending in any real confrontation, and almost never involving spraying eachother, except during mating season, when non-receptive females will spray persistent males, and both may spray if startled during breeding.\nStriped skunks can be found in almost every habitat in the United States, but are most often found in areas known as ecotomes, where two different types of environments meet. Skunks are omnivores that will eat just about anything, and these margins offer the greatest variety of food stuffs.\nHumans are the number one creators of ecotomes, planting lawns next to forests, parks in the middle of cities, and the traditional suburban layout of house/barn/garage/sheds, surrounded by lawn, surrounded by lush landscaping, across the street from a stripmall, is the ultimate ecotome!\nStriped skunks thrive in these environments, and though the humans that engineered them may never see the creatures they share their handy work with, they benefit from the skunks active removal of a host of pests, like grubs, hornets, stinkbugs, rats and mice.\nSkunks set up nests under porches or sheds, in old logs or woodpiles, and will also excavate their own underground burrows. One skunk may have as many as ten nests distributed throughout her range, and will rest and sleep in them in a random fashion.\nThey use their most secret and well-protected nest to bed down during winters in the Northern parts of their range. They don't actually hibernate, but in locations where winter temperatures fall below freezing, they will go into something called a torpor, which is a sleep period of reduced metabolism.\nUnlike hibernation, which is a long term state of very low body temperature and metabolism, torpor is a lighter sleep, with only a slightly lowered body temperature, and the animal will wake up occasionally, especially if there is a warm day or two.\nOver cold winter months, several skunks may actually den together, probably to retain body heat.\nSkunks have a fantastic defense mechanism, and so there are few animals that will mess with them, but most birds of prey have a very poor sense of smell, and the great horned owl, in particular, has no problem eating a skunk.\nBut rattlesnakes have an excellent sense of smell, and will actually stop rattling and lay low if they smell the musk of an approaching skunk, because skunks feast on snakes, and appear to be immune to the venom of snakes, bees and scorpions.\nSkunks will also eat a creature known as the stink beetle, which smells just as awful as them, and is also generally unmolested by most predators. Skunks will disarm these tasty morsels by rolling them violently around on the ground, waiting till they have expelled all their acrid chemicals. When the stinkbugs tank is empty, the skunk chows down.\nBaby Skunks!\nskunk reproduction\nskunk baby\nBreeding season for striped, hog-nosed and hooded skunks is mid-February to mid-April. In areas where there is a large skunk population, things can get pretty stinky at this time, and it is the most common time of year for dogs to get sprayed too.\nWhy? Well because skunks are so preoccupied with finding mates - as in multiple mates for both males and females - that they are easily startled, and a little anxious. Skunks also have a tendency to spray each other during this two month span, either while two males argue over a female, or when a female is not in the mood.\nThere is more of a battle than a courtship with skunks, and nightime screeching is commonly heard, but otherwise the mating is brief, and both male and female may have several partners over the course of a few days or weeks.\nIf a female conceives early in the season, the development of the fertilized eggs may be paused for a few weeks, in a process called delayed implantation. This insures that the babies will be born in the warmer months of May and June, when the winter is over, and food is more plentiful.\nThe mother prepares a nursery den, and will give birth to a litter of about 4 to 8 kittens, or kits. The newborn skunks are hairless and blind, but their bare skin has the stripe pattern already visible. They will begin to raise their tails when frightened in a matter of days, and can spray at about 3 or 4 weeks old - right about the time their eyes open.\nThe mother will start to leave the den with her little charges when they are 6 weeks old. They follow behind her in single file, and tend to maintain body contact with each other at all times when first out exploring. The family makes a lot of squeaking, gurgling type noises to keep in touch, and may seem to move as one bushy little unit.\nBabies forage and start to hunt after about 2 months, and are off on their own at 8 months. - Skunk Facts\nSkunk mother and babies\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Striped skunks occur in every one of the contiguous United States, in various habitats from seashore to city, desert to forest. They are small, cat-sized animals averaging about 6 pounds but getting as large as 16 pounds.\nThey are generally black, with a bold white splash that starts at the top of the head, splits into two stripes at the shoulders, and joins back into one stripe at the hips and down to the tip of the tail. This is the pattern that is seen most often, but markings can be quite variable across the population. Striped skunks have been seen in solid black to nearly solid white, with three or more stripes, and shades of brown instead of black.\nStriped skunks are true ground dwellers that have no climbing ability at all. In fact, one of the more common skunk-related calls pest removal services get is when a skunk has fallen into a window well, sometimes no more than 2 feet deep, and can't climb out.\nThe hooded skunk is a little smaller than the striped skunk with a smaller range, but a very similar appearance. They are called hooded because of a ruff of fur they have around their necks. Like the striped skunks, hooded skunks are not very good climbers.\nHog-nosed skunks are common in the southwestern states, especially. There are several sub-species of hog-nosed, some of which can get larger than striped skunks, and several of which are brown and white in color. Hog-nosed skunks have well developed snouts for rooting through dry soil for scorpions and spiders. They will also trudge into caves filled with bats to pick off baby bats that have fallen to the guano-covered ground. Hog-nosed skunks are more agile than striped and hooded skunks, climbing rocky slopes and hillsides regularly.\nThe smallest skunk species is the spotted skunk, which rarely gets much bigger than 2 pounds or so. The spotted skunk is quite the opposite of the other species, in that it not only climbs, but actually hunts in trees.\nThey sleep in dens or burrows on the ground, but climb exceedingly well, and will even rob birds nests of eggs and chicks. Spotted skunks are the most elusive and secretive of the skunk species, though by far the most social, sometimes denning together in groups of 5 or more.\nThe tiny spotted skunk also has the most elaborate threat display of all the skunks, maybe because it is so small. They will do a full handstand with their tail and legs hoisted completely in the air in an attempt to appear larger. Spotted skunks can walk around on their front paws like this for several minutes, hoping their combatant disperses, but if push comes to shove, they will actually eject their spray from this odd position, leaving a very lasting memory.\na few more skunk facts\nSkunks can accurately spray up to 15 feet\nSkunk spray is not urine, it is the secretions of the anal glands\nThe skunks bold coloring is a warning to stay away\nSkunks almost never spray eachother, except during mating season\nThe only thing that eats skunks regularly is the Great horned owl\nGreat horned owls have a very poor sense of smell!\nSkunks are immune to rattlesnake venom, bee stings and scorpions, and will eat all of them\nSome people keep skunks as pets"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Serval - Animals", "url": "https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/serval", "text": "Common Name : Servals Scientific Name : Leptailurus serval Diet : Carnivore Average Life Span : Up to 10 years in the wild Size : 26 to 40 inches long; tail: nine to 18 inches long Weight : Between 20 and 40 pounds\nA serval sits patiently in a grassy field, swiveling its head back and forth like a watchful owl. The predator is scanning the savanna for a meal not with its eyes, but with its oversize ears. An unseen rodent stirs under the thick brush, and the wild cat tenses. It crouches on its legs and feet before launching itself up and over the tall grass. Guided only by sound, the serval lands directly on the once-invisible rat.\nWeirdest cat ever?\nThanks to its extra-long legs, stretched-out neck, and huge ears, the serval is sometimes called the \u201ccat of spare parts.\u201d (If a person had ears like a serval\u2019s, they\u2019d be as big as dinner plates!) But put together, their bizarre-looking body parts make these cats really successful hunters. In fact, servals catch their prey in over half of their attempts, making them one of the best hunters in the wild cat kingdom. That\u2019s about 20 percent better than lions hunting together in a pride.\nBlending in\nServals rely on their coat for camouflage as they stalk prey and avoid predators where they live throughout parts of northwest Africa and much of sub-Saharan Africa. Cats like cheetahs sport spots, while others, such as tigers, wear stripes. Servals have both\u2014kind of. While they don\u2019t have actual stripes, some of their larger spots blend together to give them the appearance of stripes. That makes it tough to find a serval in high grass when it\u2019s standing still.\nNo two serval coats are the same. In fact, servals that live near woodlands have more dots that are small than those cats that spend time on the savanna; scientists think the smaller spots might hide those cats better among the shade of trees. However, white spots behind an adults\u2019 ears are supposed to be seen\u2014they help cubs keep track of Mom when she\u2019s leading them during a hunt.\nNot-so-fancy feast\nServals mostly hunt rodents\u2014on average, one serval eats 4,000 a year\u2014but they\u2019re not picky eaters like some other wild cats. They\u2019ll eat anything small enough for them to catch, including grasshoppers, snakes, and even birds as large as storks and guinea fowls. They\u2019ll occasionally wade into water to gobble up frogs and other amphibians. A serval can catch up to 30 frogs in three hours while hunting in water.\nAlso, unlike most other wild cats, they almost never scavenge, or eat other animals\u2019 leftovers. Scientists think this is because they\u2019re already such successful hunters."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Lion's Mane Jellyfish Facts Habitat, Diet, Conservation & More", "url": "https://www.americanoceans.org/species/lions-mane-jellyfish/", "text": "The lion\u2019s mane jellyfish, scientifically known as Cyanea capillata, is one of the largest species of jellyfish in the world.\nOther names for this massive breed are the hair jelly, the arctic red jellyfish, and the giant jellyfish.\nRegardless of the name, there\u2019s no doubt this massive jellyfish is the true king of the sea. Since they can glow in the dark, the lion\u2019s mane jellyfish may be one of the prettiest too.\nCharacteristics & Appearance\nWeight & Length\nLion\u2019s mane jellyfish range in size, depending on their location. Species living in lower latitudes are a smaller size than those in the north.\nBecause lion\u2019s mane jellyfish is one of the largest in the world, it makes sense that these creatures, although made up of 95% water, can weigh up to 200 pounds.\nThe length of a lion\u2019s mane jellyfish\u2019s tentacles can vary between 30 to 120 feet. The warmer the climate, the smaller they grow. The bell can vary from smaller than an inch up to almost ten feet.\nPhysical Characteristics & Color\nLion\u2019s mane jellyfish have a bell-shaped body with flowing tentacles dangling from the underside. Eight clusters, arranged in four rows, surround the jellyfish\u2019s mouth, which is on the bell\u2019s bottom.\nEach cluster, or lobe, contains up to 150 tentacles a piece. That means one lion\u2019s mane jellyfish can have up to 1,200 individual tentacles that can grow up to lengths over 100 feet.\nEach lobe also contains a rhopalium or balance organ. There are also wide oral arms that extend out of the mouth.\nNow, each tentacle \u2013 or appendage \u2013 has nematocysts that contain potent neurotoxins that can be harmful to humans. These same nematocysts cover the oral arms.\nThe top of the bell is usually red or dark yellow with a thick center that thins as it gets closer to the edge. Tentacles are typically yellow or red with purple oral arms. Similar poisonous nematocysts protect the upper portion of the bell.\nSmaller jellyfish with a bell size less than 5\u2033 are usually yellow or pink. Those between 5\u2033 and 18\u2033 are more of a red or yellowish-brown. Once they grow over 18\u2033 they end up a dark brownish-red.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nLion\u2019s mane jellyfish go through four life stages. They start as larva. Then they transform into a polyp, and then they go into the ephyrae stage, and finally the medusa. This jellyfish species has a very short life span of one year.\nWhen an adult female reaches the medusa stage, she\u2019s ready for sexual reproduction. This jellyfish species usually breeds in March and then in early May through external fertilization.\nAfter the eggs get fertilized, the female lion mane will transport these in her tentacles until the eggs form into larvae.\nOnce the larvae are old enough, the mother leaves them behind on a hard surface to become polyps. During the polyps stage, lion mane jellyfish (along with many other species) reproduce asexually.\nEach polyp produces stacks of ephyrae during this phase. Then each of these ephyrae breaks away from the group and enters the final life stage \u2013 medusa. At this point, they are full-grown and ready to reproduce sexually. The process typically takes 30 to 40 days.\nHabitat\nWhere Does the Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish live?\nThis jellyfish species prefers colder waters in regions where there are harsh, frigid winters and cool summers. They do best in waters colder than 68\u00b0F since they don\u2019t do well when it\u2019s warm.\nThey prefer to float near the surface in open waters throughout their adult lives, but they end their days settled in shallow bays. They rarely go below 66 feet deep.\nThe largest concentrations of lion\u2019s mane jellyfish are in the colder parts of the Arctic, northern parts of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Occasionally, they migrate into southwestern areas of the Baltic Sea.\nOutlying populations are sometimes spotted in the Chesapeake Bay during the winter. But these do not get as large as those that live out in the middle of the ocean. There have been sightings of these giant jellyfish in large bays along the east coast below 42\u00b0N.\nThis species is also commonly seen in the North and Irish Seas, the English Channel, and in some parts of Scandinavia as far south as Kattegat and \u00d8resund.\nLion\u2019s mane jellyfish are always on the move, usually alone rather than in swarms. They can cover large distances when there\u2019s strong moving water. During storms or tides, these jellyfish may swim together in large groups.\nFood & Diet\nWhat Does the Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish eat?\nA lion\u2019s mane jellyfish has a limited diet that consists of small fish, other smaller jellyfish, ctenophores, zooplankton, crustaceans, and moon jellies.\nThis species is bioluminescent, which means they can glow in the dark. The glow can lure prey close enough for the jellyfish to reach out and grab them with their extra sticky tentacles and poisonous stingers to catch these small prey.\nTheir stingers cause the prey to become stunned once the tentacles wrap around them.\nHowever, out in the open water, some species of food seek shelter under a jellyfish\u2019s bell. Medusafish, shrimp, juvenile prowfish, butterfish, and harvestfish provide food and protection from other predators.\nThreats & Predators\nSmaller, young lion\u2019s mane jellyfish are more likely to fall victim to being eaten by larger prey.\nOnce these jellyfish reach adulthood, it becomes much more difficult for other species to eat them.\nTheir large size and poisonous stingers protect them from attacks and turn their predators into prey. One of the few animals that can eat an adult would be anemones, which also feed on juveniles.\nHuman Threats\nThankfully, most people won\u2019t encounter these jellyfish, and if they do, they won\u2019t be as large. Because they live in the open water, there\u2019s less interference in their lives from humans.\nResearch suggests that these jellyfish do quite well in environments where there are human activities. Overfishing helps remove more of their competition for food, allowing them to grow bigger and multiply easier.\nClimate Change & Global Warming\nClimate change has not negatively impacted the lion\u2019s mane jellyfish population. Global warming, climate change, and pollution have actually allowed for more jellyfish swarms because there are fewer predators or competition but plenty of food.\nPredators\nCommon predators of the lion\u2019s mane jellyfish include other jellyfish, ocean sunfish, seabirds, and sea turtles, primarily Leatherbacks who have a strong preference for their taste and make jellyfish their sole source of food during summer.\nOther Threats\nAll jellyfish, including the lion\u2019s mane species, have little to no other threats, as their size, poison, and short life span allow them to dominate their environment.\nConservation Status\nThe lion\u2019s mane jellyfish has a common conservation status, which means they are an abundant species found in multiple locations. They are not currently in danger of extinction.\nFun Facts About the Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish"}

If this plus-sized cat was, in fact, a true lion\u2014some paleontologists speculate that it may have been a species of jaguar or tiger\u2014it was the largest of its kind that ever lived, outweighing its contemporary African relatives by hundreds of pounds. Even still, the American lion was no match for Smilodon, a more heavily built predator (only distantly related to the Panthera genus) that employed an entirely different hunting style.\nOn the other hand, the American lion may have been smarter than Smilodon; before the advent of human civilization, thousands of saber-toothed tigers became mired in the La Brea Tar Pits in search of prey, but only a few dozen individuals of Panthera leo atrox met such a fate. Intelligence would have been a valuable trait in the competitive landscape of Pleistocene North America, where the American lion had to out-hunt not only Smilodon but also the dire wolf (Canis dirus) and the giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), among other megafauna mammals. Unfortunately, by the end of the last Ice Age, all of these vicious carnivores occupied the same dismal playing field, hunted to extinction by early humans at the same time as climate change and a reduction in their usual prey thinned out their populations.\nHow was the American lion related to another famous big cat of Pleistocene North America, the cave lion? According to a recent analysis of mitochondrial DNA (which is passed on only by females, thus allowing for detailed genealogical studies), the American lion diverged from an isolated family of cave lions, cut off from the rest of the population by glacial activity, about 340,000 years ago. From that point on, the American lion and the cave lion coexisted in different North American territories, pursuing different hunting strategies."}

Once the most powerful male sends weaker competition fleeing, he must prove his worth to his sweetheart. The mating pair will engage in loud, highly aggressive wrestling sessions, and if the female is not impressed, she will move on to another fellow.\nIf the male is powerful and dominant enough, the two will mate several times over the course of a few days. Both males and females may mate with numerous partners during the season, and it is actually possible for one litter of babies to have two, three, or even four different fathers.\nAfter about three weeks of pregnancy the female Tasmanian devil finds a comfortable den and settles in.\nShe will give birth to as many as 30 tiny babies that are blind, hairless, and less than the size of a single grain of rice. They are effectively still just embryos, and must make it to the mothers pouch in order to continue development.\nWithout their mothers help, an army of squirming babies crawl through a forest of belly-hair from the birth canal to the mothers pouch, which is a distance of about 4 inches, (a long trip for a grain of rice).\nThen, in a true example of \"survival of the fittest\" the baby Tasmanian devils find only four teats in the mothers pouch. The four that make it to a teat first survive, the rest perish.\nFour months later, the tough little devils emerge from moms pouch and explore their world.\nThe sound of a litter of devils play fighting is blood-curdling and constant, and by the time they are eight months old, they start off on their own, complaining the whole way.\na devils life in three easy steps\nLike a miniature African lion the always ravenous Tasmanian devil is a \"gorge feeder\" filling up to the brim as long as food is available and then collapsing flat on the ready-to-bust belly, legs outstretched, to digest the huge meal.\nIt goes like this -\nStep One: Scurry about wailing and complaining till you find something dead.\nStep Two: Eat till you're ready to explode.\nStep Three: Sprawl out like a bear-skin rug and process, process, process...\ndevil facial tumor disease\nIn the late 1990's an unusual cancer began to appear in the wild populations of Tasmanian devils.

Their bodies are incredibly strong, though this strength is used for multiple purposes.\nSnakes have a close relationship to lizards, which are also reptiles. While snakes have no eyelids or ear holes, they have become a well-loved pet by many eclectic owners. The serpent, a mythical symbol that is broadly known everywhere, is simply another term for it.\n5 Incredible Snake Facts!\nHere are a few interesting facts about these reptiles:\nOut of over 3,800 different types, only 600 have venomous fangs. Snakes like the gopher snake and kingsnakes are nonvenonmous. Only 200 of these snakes have enough potency to harm a human.\nThough they are a reptile, like a lizard is, they have no eyelids or ear holes.\nSnakes do not chew their food, despite the presence of teeth. Instead, they swallow it whole.\nThese reptiles can be found on every continent but Antarctica.\nThe snake to have lived the longest is located in Missouri and she is 62 years old.\nSnake Scientific Name\nThese reptiles go by the scientific name Serpentes and belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata. Their class is called Reptilia and the order is called Squamata. The clade is called Ophidia.\nSerpentes, which is often shortened to the serpent in mythical stories, comes from the Latin word \u201cserp\u014d,\u201d which means \u201ccreep\u201d or \u201ccrawl.\u201d\nSnake Appearance\nSnakes are reptiles, but they noticeably have no legs. However, not every legless reptile is known as a snake. Seemingly, the only components to a snake are their head and their tail, which takes up the entire length of their body. Some snakes are as short as 4.1 inches (like the Barbados thread snake), though the longest snake in the world (which is the reticulated python) is over 20 feet long.\nThe teeth of these reptiles will vary by the species as well. Some species have several needle-sharp teeth, while others have fangs. The snakes with fangs naturally store their venom in the sacs that are behind the eyes. The venom is poisonous, but only about 600 species have it. A snake, sometimes referred to as a serpent, has no earholes, but its ears are internal.\nThese reptiles are covered in scales, though they have skin like humans underneath them. The markings are determined by the species, but there is hardly a color that you won\u2019t see. The color is often a sign of how dangerous the snake is, but the pattern will help differentiate the threats from harmless animals. Often, snakes are found in every color of the rainbow, including red, green, yellow, blue, and black. A high abundance of color means that it is more dangerous, though venomous snakes usually have a triangular head. Read here to know about snakes that change their color to blend it.\nRattlesnakes have a large rattle at the end of their tail, which emits a loud noise to let animals and humans know that they are not to be messed with. It is also important to note that there are some animals that look like snakes, but aren\u2019t.\nThe body of the animal is also indicative of the way that the snake hunts. Animals with long and thin bodies will hunt down their prey by hunting through bushes, while short yet thick snakes will sit and wait for their prey.\nRead here to learn more about the anatomy of snakes. Also, read here to learn about the most colorful snakes in the world.\nSome snakes look like dragons. Read here to find out about them.\nreptiles4all/Shutterstock.com\nSnake Behavior\nWhen it comes to hunting, snakes have an incredible sense of smell that they rely on. As they flick out their tongue, they seek out the chemicals in the air. Other snakes will use their ability to detect body heat. Constriction and venom tend to be the main ways that the prey is overpowered.\nThese reptiles seek out the right environment to keep their body warm since their cold-blooded body is unable to regulate their temperature. Most often, snakes will use natural sunlight to keep their body warm, but they will hide to cool off as well.\nSnakes shed their skin when they grow. Some of them change their eye color when the shedding occurs, becoming paler than their typical color. The shedding process can be rather uncomfortable, but it is harmless to the user.\nThough some species produce venom, the majority do not. Only 600 species have any kind of venom, and only a third of those venomous snakes have the capacity to wound humans at all, and even fewer can fatally kill them. Learn about the toughest animals in the world here.\nThough humans are not a natural part of the reptile\u2019s diet, it will bite if it feels threatened. In certain species, this bite can be fatal. There are scary and dangerous species in the world, the most lethal being the saw-scaled viper, killing more humans than any other species.\nRead about the most dangerous animals on earth to humans here.\nCommon Types of Snakes\nThe following list includes some common types of snakes found around the world:\nPythons \u2013 Pythons are a family of snakes consisting of 42 total recognized species. These reptiles can be found mostly in Asia, Australia, and Africa; however, the Burmese python was introduced in the Florida Everglades and is currently considered an invasive species. Most species in this family are \u201cambush predators\u201d meaning they remain motionless and strike as prey passes by.\n\u2013 Pythons are a family of snakes consisting of 42 total recognized species.

Most species in this family are \u201cambush predators\u201d meaning they remain motionless and strike as prey passes by. Elapids \u2013 Most elapids are commonly referred to as \u201ccobras.\u201d These snakes are characterized by the erect, venomous fangs at the front of their mouths, and species can be terrestrial or aquatic. Elapids are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world.\n\u2013 Most elapids are commonly referred to as \u201ccobras.\u201d These snakes are characterized by the erect, venomous fangs at the front of their mouths, and species can be terrestrial or aquatic.

Rattlesnakes \u2013 Rattlesnakes are found on the American continents and are characterized by the rattle at the end of their tails which they use to scare off predators. Although rattlesnakes rarely attack humans unless provoked, rattlesnake bites are the leading cause for snakebite injuries in North America.\n\u2013 Rattlesnakes are found on the American continents and are characterized by the rattle at the end of their tails which they use to scare off predators. Although rattlesnakes rarely attack humans unless provoked, rattlesnake bites are the leading cause for snakebite injuries in North America. Garters \u2013 Garter snakes are generally harmless snakes found throughout North and Central America. These snakes were long believed to be non-venomous, but recent studies have determined that they produce a neurotoxic venom which is too mild to injure or kill a human.\nSnake Habitat\nSnakes are quite versatile, and many types work in the climates of the world. Though the only continent without snakes is Antarctica, there are a few countries that aren\u2019t home to any native snake, including Ireland, New Zealand, and Iceland. Alaska is one of the few states that also has no native species.\nThe typical habitat is just as broad as where they can live. In water-based and land-based environments alike, these reptiles can also be found in tropical areas. While the water moccasin and the water snake commonly live near and in water, most snakes live on land. Based on the species, snakes can live in deserts, grasslands, and the rainforest.\nSnake Diet\nThese reptiles have a carnivorous diet, meaning that their diet entirely consists of other animals. They can choose warm-blooded or cold-blooded animals, seeking out amphibians, insects, and mammals. For the most part, they don\u2019t eat other reptiles, but some of them have been known to go after smaller species.\nThough every snake will consume their prey whole, the way that they render them helpless varies. Boas and pythons will bite their prey to hold onto them, wrapping their body around and squeezing the life from the prey. If the animal has fangs, it will deliver venom to its prey. The venom comes from a sac that is hidden behind the eyes.\nSnake Predators and Threats\nThese reptiles are rather quick and effective predators, but they are also the prey of many different animals. One of the biggest predators of these reptiles is humans. Humans will use them for meat, clothing, and many other purposes, though the animal is largely not considered to be endangered.\nThe population of these reptiles can be negatively impacted by deforestation, hunting, and climate change. Ultimately, the threat that the snake faces is specific to many factors, like the species, where they live, and how much meat that they provide. Learn about some snakes that are endangered here.\nTo learn about some snakes that don\u2019t bite, read here.\nWhat Eats Snakes?\nThese reptiles may be rather impressive hunters, but animals like large birds and coyotes have made these reptiles into a regular part of their diet. They are also hunted by mongooses, wild boars, foxes, raccoons, and other game that can pick them up and consume them. Some snakes eat other snakes. They are called ophiophagus.\nLuckily, each species has its own way to defend itself against threats. Camouflage plays a major role in their defense, hiding for additional coverage. Venomous species will bite as a last resort, but they primarily will try to flee instead.\nWhat Do Snakes Eat?\nSince all of these reptiles are carnivores, there are many small animals that can become their prey. The diet that the animal consumes is based on their species. Insects, amphibians, earthworms, slugs, fish, rodents, rabbits, and birds are all possible foods. Some snakes eat eggs.\nRead here to discover some snakes that eat fish and some snakes that eat birds.\nSnake Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe reproduction process of these reptiles is primarily a process of internal fertilization. Most species intertwine their bodies with that of their partner, and the male releases the sperm from one of the two organs it has. The female doesn\u2019t necessarily become pregnant with her young right away; some females can store the male\u2019s sperm for 2-5 years before fertilization.\nThe species will determine the type of birth that the female has. Rattlesnakes and garter snakes will give birth to their babies as live young, which makes them ovoviviparous. However, species like the ball python and the corn snake will lay eggs, which makes them oviparous. In fact, approximately 70% of all these reptiles are oviparous, rather than ovoviviparous.\nThe number of eggs or live young will vary greatly. For snakes that give birth to live young, about 10-30 are born in each litter, though the diamondback water snake can have up to 40 babies in a litter. The live-bearing females often find a sheltered spot where they give birth to the babies. For the species that lay eggs, the clutch size varies significantly. While the ball python may only lay a single egg, some clutches are up to 100 eggs annually.\nThe species of snake will determine their lifespan. While smaller species (like the garter snake) live for less than ten years, the various types of boas can leave for about 25 to 50 years. As of September 2020, the longest living snake is a ball python who is currently 62 years old and lives in the St. Louis Zoo of Missouri.\nSnake Population\nJukka Palm/Shutterstock.com\nWith over 3,000 types of snakes around the world, the total population varies from country to country. Interestingly, there are a few countries that have no known native species of snakes at all, including Ireland and Antarctica. Here is a compilation of pre-historic snakes.\nOf the thousands of snake species, approximately 600 species are venomous. Still, the unpopular nature of this reptile has led many people to believe that this statistic means that they are dangerous, which is not accurate. Of the 600 venomous snakes, only 22 species actually can harm a human.\nThough there are some species with lower populations, snakes (as a whole) are classified as \u201cnot extinct\u201d by the IUCN. Here is a list of the most popular snakes in the world.\nRead about the rarest snakes in the world here. To know more about some prehistoric snakes, read here.\nSnakes In the Zoo\nThese reptiles can be found at nearly every major zoo, allowing the public to become more informed of the types of this reptile that span across the globe. Most often, the zoos will include snakes that are local to their region, so the species will vary from one location to the next.\nWhen visiting this reptile, most species will simply relax in their tank. However, some zoos (like the Virginia Living Museum) features demonstrations outside of the tanks to allow patrons to get a closer look. With more awareness about harmless and dangerous types of snakes, the fear typically associated with these animals can be erased.\nSnakes that live in zoos may not exhibit the same outward symptoms of illness that they show in the wild. Zookeepers are incredibly familiar with the behavior that these snakes show when they are ill, allowing them to get fast treatment when they become sick.\nSome types of snakes can be kept as pets, like the corn snake or the rosy boa.\nRead More\nRead about:\nTypes of Snakes\nList of Snakes\nView all 180 animals that start with S"}

All the animals in the \"Big Five\" have killed human beings, but are not statistically the most dangerous animals.\nThe real test was from a hunting stand point, and big game hunters over the years have declared these five animals to be the most difficult to track down and persue in their native habitats. Danger is a consideration, but hippos actually kill more people than any of the Big Five, yet aren't on the list because they apparently are not as difficult to hunt.\nThe cape buffalo\nThe cape buffalo is perhaps the most dangerous of the \"Big Five\", particularly if it is injured. They are notorious for seeking revenge on hunters in the bush, turning the tables, tracking down those who shot at or injured them, and sometimes attacking and even killing entire hunting parties.\nKnown as the \"Black Death\", the biggest danger in hunting them is that they are so physically dense and muscular that it may take several shots to bring them down. Angered and in pain they may charge and kill the hunter before the bullets have any effect.\nthe african elephant\nThe African elephant is the largest land animal and also one of the most intelligent. They live in family groups made up of females and their youngsters, headed by a wise matriarch. The elephant is extremely social and has shown evidence of compassion and empathy, as well as indications that they mourn dead relatives. Elephants will examine and caress the bones of dead friends and relatives for years after their passing and have been seen to walk deliberately off course to visit a the site of a family members passing.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They are significantly smaller than lions and tigers, and occasionally even fall prey to a hungry lion. The jaguar is native to south and central America, and once roamed the southern United States. Both leopards and jaguars are buff to yellow to orange in color with black or dark brown spots in a classic \"rosette\" pattern. Black individuals occur fairly regularly, the result of a melanism gene. The spots can still be seen on the black fur as subtle shading. Both black leopards and black jaguars are popularly called black panthers, although they are not a separate species and black individuals will occur side by side in the same litter with normally colored cubs. Leopards and jaguars are difficult to tell apart if the location is unknown The jaguar is generally a stouter animal with a proportionately rounder head, fuller cheeks and smaller eyes and ears. It is sometimes stated that the leopard does not have a dot at the center of the circles of dots on its coat known as \"rosettes\", or that the center of the rosette on the jaguar is darker than the body color, but both jaguars and leopards vary greatly in this regard and coat pattern is not a reliable means of identification.\nThe african lion\nNative to Africa and a tiny portion of India, the lion is the most unique of these cats. Adult male lions display a full ruff of shaggy hair around their heads known as a mane.\nThis is not just special for a big cat, it is very rare among any mammals to have such obvious physical distinction between the sexes. The lion is also a very social cat with an interesting and complicated pride dynamic.\nThe king of beasts also has the loudest roar of the four roaring \"big cats\" - naturally!\nthe rhinocerus\nBlack rhinos and white rhinos are both native to Africa. They are actually both basically shades of grey in color, and their top lip is a far better way to tell them apart.\nThe white rhino eats low grasses on the plains and has a wide, straight top lip to shave grass blades close to the ground.\nThe black rhino dines on different types of vegetation, including buds and shoots in the brush. They have a pointed top lip that is prehensile to wrap around buds and leaves and pull them off branches.\na few more facts about \"Africa's Big five\"\nThe cape buffalo is known as the \"Black Death\"\nThe lion has the loudest roar of all the big cats\nElephants make some noises that are too low for us to hear\nCape buffalo can weigh as much as 2000 pounds"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Hippo Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Hippo-facts.html", "text": "hippo Facts\nPortrait of a Hippo\nThe hippopotamus, commonly referred to as the hippo, is a round, bald, cantankerous herbivore with a semi-aquatic lifestyle and a fearsome reputation. At 14 to 16 feet, and 4,000 pounds, they are about as long and heavy as a Ford Fusion. The 3 foot skull houses huge, protruding canines, called tusks, contained in a broad, cavernous mouth, that can be opened to a gape of 150 degrees - 3 times wider than the human jaw.\nThe hippos bulbous body is supported by oddly slender legs, but these legs have osteosclerotic bones, meaning they are extremely dense, with little of the porous material that is present in most mammalian leg bones. This skeletal adaption allows the enormous hippo to sink to the bottom of the river, and walk on the riverbed floor.\nAlthough they spend nearly 16 hours a day wallowing in rivers and streams, hippos don't actually swim. When not strolling along the bottom, they propel themselves by pushing off the riverbed, or rocks, driftwood, or other hippos, and gliding along for a distance, before pushing off again.\nThe hippo is the third largest land animal, falling in line behind the elephant and the white rhino. The black rhino averages about the same size as most hippos, and other rhinoceros species are smaller.\nHippos are amphibious, and live in swamps, rivers and lakes throughout the southern two-thirds of Africa. Their skin is mostly bare, with extremely fine, sparse hair over the body, and some whiskers across the muzzle. The inner layers of skin are thick, and there is, of course, also a layer of blubber, similar to that of their closest relatives, the whales. But the epidermis, or outer layer of skin, is very thin and delicate, and will dehydrate and crack without a water source to bathe in.\nThe skin also secretes an oily substance called \"blood sweat\". This secretion is completely unique to hippos, and is neither blood, nor sweat. It has a reddish or pink hue, and not only protects the skin from sunburn and dehydration, but is also believed to have antibiotic properties, which help prevent infection in the event that the skin does crack.\nHippopotamus!\nHippos live in loose groups of ten to thirty individuals, that may swell to hundreds depending on the season. During drought, limited waterways are packed with writhing hippos trying to stay moisturized, and competition and aggression can lead to many squabbles, battles, and violent confrontations.\nThese tendencies are not preserved for their own kind, however. Ask any game warden, big game hunter or native of the African wilds, and they will tell you that hippos are not just huge and fearless, but also often so ruthlessly aggressive that they have been known to capsize small boats just to get a mouthful of hapless occupants.\nThe portly hippo is just as dangerous on land. Capable of running in excess of 20 miles per hour, there have been reports of hippos chasing human beings on foot, and snatching them with massive jaws that are wider than a pizza delivery box!\nIn fact, the hippopotamus is responsible for over 2,900 human fatalities a year! That's more than lions and leopards combined. An amazing statistic for the vegetarian hippo.\nChubby and balding, yes. But don't tell him that to his face!\nhippo lifestyle\nherd of hippos\nhippopotamus underwater\nHippopotamuses are very gregarious animals, living, virtually on top of each other at times, in groups of up to 150 individuals. But despite their crowded existence, they are actually not particularly social. The only real family unit is a mother with her offspring.\nAdults do not form strong bonds, and spend very little time interacting in ways that we might recognize as friendship. There aren't any little cliques, or close buddies, no mutual grooming, and nothing much in the form of play.\nIt might be added that hippos don't have very large brains for their enormous size, and so tend to be remarkably simple animals.\nThese are creatures of habit, for sure, spending the daytime hours lounging in the water, and rolling in mud. They may bask in the sun, as long as they are only steps from the river or lake where they can dive back in if they get too hot or dry. At dusk, as the day cools and the sun sets, the herd leaves the water and heads down well traveled paths where they branch off to graze.\nWith several species of tender grasses making up the bulk of their diet, the hippo spends about 6 hours a night feeding. Large adults can consume about 80 pounds of grass in a singles evening. They generally graze in solitary, wandering 3 to 5 miles as they dine, and sometimes napping in sandy areas.\nThere is little aggression displayed on land, and no clear territories delineated or defended.\nBefore returning to the river, they will defecate in communal \"dung middens\".\nBack in the water during the day is when adult males spend allot of time establishing territories. Dominant males will secure areas of riverfront, chase other dominant males out, and attempt to mate with the females who live in their territory. Subordinate males who show the appropriate respect are allowed to stay.\nMales display their dominance with yawning displays, and bulls will battle for superiority by facing eachother with massive jaws agape, pushing and bludgeoning each other with their tusks. Injuries are common, and most old bulls have many scars.\nHippos are very vocal and incredibly loud. Their snorts and bellows, particualarly while wading together in crowded pools, can be heard for long d- Hippo Facts\nHippo life\nhippo reproduction\nbaby hippo kisses mommy\nhappy hippo mother and baby\nOnly the largest and most aggressive male hippos, perhaps only 1 in 10, will ever establish their own territory, attract willing females, and successfully reproduce. The rest will spend their lives in loosely formed bachelor herds and never breed.\nDominant males establish themselves by staking claim to a section of real estate, marking it with copious amounts of dung and urine, and battling any males that are not completely submissive.\nA male who has secured his own territory will mark it by releasing a combination of feces and urine while he spins his tail around like a propeller blade. The dung spray is tossed in all directions by the hippos spinning tail, coating sand, shrubs and rocks. He will even spray females in his territory.\nAs the dry season brings more hippos together in one area, most mating occurs during the drought. The timing insures that youngsters will be born during the wet season, when mothers are less crowded and have more resources.\nHippos usually mate in the water, which probably makes things a bit easier given the size of the participants. The pregnancy is only 8 months long, but yields an enormous calf, often 100 pounds at birth. The mother will go off alone when she is ready, and may deliver the baby on land or in the water. If it is an underwater birth, the mother must nose the baby to the surface to get its first gasp of air.\nA mother hippo is highly protective and she will wait several days before bringing her calf around the herd. She will spend most of her time in the water with her youngster, who nurses underwater and will rest and sleep on its mothers back as she wades. She will not leave to graze for several days until the baby is strong enough to accompany her. Some hippo mothers leave their babies alone in the water while they go to feed, but return quickly.\nCrocodiles and lions are a danger for baby hippos, but another cause of fatality among hippo babies is being crushed by other adult hippos, particularly if a scuffle breaks out.\nBaby hippos nurse for about 18 months, but are sampling grasses within a few weeks of birth. Mothers will often park youngsters together to make babysitting easier. Young hippos will stay with their mothers until they are mature, about 8 years. A mother hippo may live together with as many as five of her offspring, and sometimes grandkids.\n- Hippo Facts\nhippopotamus babies\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They look more like pigs than perhaps any other animal, but pigs and hippos are not closely related at all. They are called \"water horses\" but are far from equine. In fact, the closest relative of the hippos are the whales.\nIt is theorized that whales and dolphins were actually land animals at one point, that migrated back to the sea. And it is thought that they once looked very much like hippos!\nThe hippopotamus has specialized sensory organs that are all placed at the roof of the head. Nostrils, eyes and ears are positioned so that the hippo may be almost completely submerged, and nearly invisible from land, yet still see, hear and smell what's going on. And while their jaw is submerged, they can receive vibrations through it that register as sounds, and let the hippo know what's happening underwater as well.\nHippos are extremely vocal underwater, and actually create sounds that are similar to whales. It is theorized that they may even use a form of echolocation as they navigate through muddy rivers and lakes, since they produce dolphin-like clicking noises only when they are under water, never on land.\nWhen it's time to submerge, the nostrils and ears close, and the eyes have a clear membrane that protects them like goggles. The bones of the limbs are exceptionally dense to allow the hippo to sink to the bottom, while the blubber-wrapped body keeps the torso more elevated. A push from the webbed toes provides the boost, and the smooth, buoyant hippo glides gracefully through the depths.\nThe hippo has amazing canine teeth as well, which continue to grow throughout their lives, and in males can get to be almost 2 feet long. These tusks are damaging instruments of battle, but are also used to rut around with and sometimes even scratch an itch.\npygmy hippo facts\npygmy hippos\nThe only other living hippo species is the pygmy hippopotamus. Less than one-sixth the size of the common hippo, pygmy hippos are only about 5 feet long, 3 feet tall, and 500 to 600 pounds.\nThe pygmy hippo is a solitary creature living in the swamps and dense forests of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Ivory Coast. They have proportionately smaller, less dramatically shaped heads, with lower set ears, eyes and nostrils, indicating their less aquatic lifestyle.\nTheir skin is like that of the common hippo, with a thin epidermis, and the same \"blood sweat\" secretion. They also have tusk-like teeth, but they spend much more time on land, and much less time squabbling with neighbors.\nPygmy hippos are not very territorial and have few confrontations. They tend to come together for matings only, and mothers raise the offspring on their own. The newborn is a mere 12 pounds or so, and may be born either on land or in water.\nThe pygmy hippopotamus is hunted by native cultures and eaten as a delicacy.\nOnly about 3,000 pygmy hippos live in the wild, and they are seriously threatened.\nthe pygmy hippo\nHippos!\na few more Hippo facts\nhippos wading\nA group of hippos is called a raft, pod, herd, dale or bloat!\nHippos regularly hold their breath for 5 minutes or more\nBaby hippos are usually born underwater and must swim to the surface to take their first breath!\nThe name \"hippopotamus\" means \"water-horse\"\nThe hippos tusks never stop growing\nHippos generally do not eat in the water\nHippos leave the water at night to eat grass\nThe whale is the closest relative of the hippo"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Walrus Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Walrus-facts.html", "text": "walrus Facts\nPortrait of a Walrus\nOne of the most interesting walrus facts, is that they are one of the world's most social animals, spending about a third of their lives sleeping right on top of each other. The walrus is an aquatic carnivore with a voluminous body that has been specially designed for life in a frozen environment.\nWalruses can be found in the icy oceans of the North Pole at the top of the world, in places like Canada, Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Scandinavia.\nThe walrus is a member of the seal or pinniped family. The word pinniped means \"flipper feet\" or \"feather feet\". Within the pinniped family are three types of semi-aquatic marine mammals, the \"true seals\", the \"eared seals\" and the walrus.\nThe walrus is alone in its own genus, and there are 2 main species. The Atlantic walrus can be about 8 feet long and 2,000 pounds, while the Pacific walrus is larger, averaging about 10 feet long, with individuals topping 14 feet long and around 4,000 pounds.\nIt is actually believed that the walrus descended from a 3 foot long, bear-like animal that lived on land some 10 million years ago, and somehow during its evolutionary journey, returned to the ocean where its limbs slowly became flippers. Walrus flippers are short and square with all the skeletal features of a terrestrial forelimb, including five fully formed digits, but the digits are completely webbed. Each digit has a small nail, and the underside of the flippers are thick and roughened for traction on ice and snow.\nLiving in some of the coldest regions of the world, the walrus is equipped with nearly 1 inch of thick, wrinkled skin, and a blubber layer right underneath that can be almost 6 inches thick. Some mature males develop large, mole-like nodules called \"bosses\" over the skin of their necks, giving them a warty texture.\nThe skin color of the walrus changes as the animal moves from land to sea, and those changes are particularly evident on mature and older walruses who have thinning hair. The walrus is able to dive to depths of over 300 feet because of special adaptions that conserve oxygen.\nOn a deep dive, the blood retreats from the animals extremities and surrounds the brain and vital organs. The skin grows paler the longer the walrus is underwater, and on long diving binges, the walrus may even look white. Once they return to land, the blood begins to flow freely again, and the skin looks brown. When the walrus sunbathes for extended periods of time, the blood moves closer to the skins surface to be warmed, and the walrus will take on a pink hue.\nThe entire body of the walrus is shaped for water travel, starting with a small, flat-topped head, widening out to hulking shoulders, and narrowing again, like a huge spindle, to the rear flippers. Most of the underwater propulsion comes from the rear flippers, with the front flippers kept close to the sides and used only occasionally for steering and extra boost.\nGetting around on land requires stepping with the front flippers and then writhing the big torso forward, and may be assisted by stabbing the ice with the tusks and pulling. This is why the Latin name for the walrus translates roughly to \"tooth walker\".\nThe tusks are enlarged canine teeth, and both males and females grow them, although the males can be quite a bit larger. Babies are born without tusks, but they begin to grow out of the gums at about 6 months old, and will start to appear from under the top lip at about 14 months.\nThey are thought to continue growing for the first 15 to 20 years of a potential 40 year lifespan, and massive tusks mean high social rank. In fact, an established walrus that breaks a tusk will quickly loose its status.\nwalrus lifestyle\nWalruses are carnivores that eat virtually no plant material. They occasionally hunt small seals, and sometimes individual males will become very successful with that strategy. There have even been numerous accounts of two or more walruses teaming up to hunt together.\nBut mostly, the gigantic walrus feeds on very small creatures located in the environment of the sea floor known as the benthic zone. Clams and mollusks are their preferred snack, but sea cucumbers, worms, shrimp and fish are consumed as well, and the walrus can eat several thousand individual organism in a single feeding.\nThe wonderful face full of whiskers that gives the walrus such character, is a hunting tool. The whiskers are tactile hairs known as vibrissae, which are used to troll the sandy sea bottom. If the walrus finds something that needs to be dislodged, it will spit a jet of water into the crevice and knock the morsel free. When eating clams, the walrus uses great suction power, sucking the meat out and spitting the shell out.\nWalruses will skim along the ocean floor with their tusks parallel to the bottom and their whiskers busy kneading through the substrate. They use their tusks as sled runners, and rest on them as they go.\nAlthough it would seem to make sense, recent research shows walruses do not use their tusks when foraging in the deep sea. In fact, the main use of the tusks is to help the walrus haul itself up out of the water and onto an iceberg.\nAs they approach the edge of an iceberg, which may be sticking out of the water a few inches or a few feet, the walrus throws its head back and stabs the surface with its tusks, using them to lever itself out of the water.\nIts a pretty slick move, and when you see a mass like that wrenching itself from the ocean in a single motion you realize the simple utility of the incredible tusks. Naturally they are used for other things, like defense, scratching and as a measure of maturity and social status, but they are used most often as a kind of glorified shoehorn.\nThe walrus is an extremely social animal which seems to desire and take comfort in the closeness of the herd. Their lives are dictated by their need for lots of food, and they generally have schedules of eating that are pretty extreme. They will swim out to their feeding areas, dive up to 330 ft down to the bottom, although 80 to 200 foot dives are most common, and feed for 5 to 12 minutes at a time, and then return to the surface to breathe and rest.\nThese dives are amazing feats of engineering, where the blood moves away from the extremities and is concentrated around the brain and vital organs, while the blubber layer insulates, and the heartbeat slows to conserve heat.\nWhen they come back up to breathe, they redirect air into large chambers in their throats called \u2018pharyngeal pouches\u2019 that inflate and act like life preservers. With these pouches inflated they can rest effortlessly on the surface, and will even sleep in the water with their heads tossed back, bobbing dreamily.\nThe pharyngeal pouches are used as a way to communicate as well. Air can be pushed back and forth between the two chambers making a bell-like sound called \"chiming\". Another body part noise maker are the walruses very large flat teeth. They will chatter their jaws together and make a sound called \"clacking\" that sounds like drums.\nWalruses may spend 60 to 80 hours at sea feeding continuously, and then return to shore to haul out and rest, one on top of the other, in piles of dozens or hundreds of individuals, for 3 or 4 days straight.\nplaying walruses\nwalrus facts on reproduction\nbaby walrus\nWalruses live in huge herds of sometimes several thousand individuals, but these herds are separated by sex, and only come together once a year to mate. Females in estrus will gather in groups on the beach, and males will stake out territories on the coastline and try to attract them. Bulls will display by throwing their heads back and freezing with their tusks in the air, and making chiming noises by pushing air back and forth in their pharyngeal pouches.\nThey may fight with other bulls, using their tusks, and wrestling with each other. Immature bulls, and older or weaker males will remain in their herd and not participate.\nA bull must be in peak condition with fully developed tusks in order to attract females, and they won't generally be interested until he is about 15 years old. Cows won't mate until they are about 8 years old, and these long development times give the walrus a very slow reproductive rate, so it is difficult to maintain stressed populations.\nMating may occur both on land and in the water and then the female returns to her herd.\nThe walrus has a process of delayed implantation, which means the embryo does not start to develop until it has been in the womb for about 4 months. This ensures the youngsters will be born at the most ideal time of year, when food is plentiful.\nThe entire pregnancy lasts about 15 months, but the baby actually grows for only 11 months. The mother will usually seek a private ice float when she's ready to give birth. A newborn walrus, known as a pup or a calf, may weigh 100 to 150 pounds. Baby walruses are well developed when born with fur and open eyes, and they can swim within about an hour.\nDaughters or other female relatives, may join the new mom and can be very protective and maternal. Female walruses have been known to adopt orphans, and the walrus mother is exceptionally loving and cuddly. She will exchange kisses, and hold the baby in her flippers while floating in the water.\nThe baby stays very close, both on land and at sea, and if their are aunts around, they will surround the baby and form a shield of protection, especially while swimming.\nWhen babies are small, they may ride on their mothers back, balancing with their little flippers. They are born without tusks, but they cut through the gums at 5 or 6 months.\nThe baby may start to forage on the ocean floor by 6 or 7 months old, but may continue to nurse for up to 2 years.\nWalrus mothers are fiercely protective and will actively fight polar bears to protect their young. The polar bear is the babies primary threat, but killer whales will prey upon them as well.\nwalrus mother and baby\nthe endangered walrus\nGlobal warming has all sorts of negative effects on the world and its creatures. Some scientists believe that the Arctic could be entirely without ice during the summer months within 20 to 25 years. Walruses are bottom feeders who forage for invertebrates in the relatively shallow waters off the coasts.\nWhen not feeding they spend much of their time on sea-ice. Mother walruses give birth on sea ice in the springtime. Mothers depend on the sea ice for safety from predators as they raise their calves. The problem the melting ice cap poses for walruses is that the distance between the sea ice where they live for much of the year, and the coastlines where they feed is increasing as the ice margins recede.\nFor some mothers with youngsters, it means the babies aren't strong enough to make the trip back and forth. And mothers are forced to come ashore with their babies, where they can fall prey to hunters and polar bears. This scenario is becoming more and more true for adult walruses as well. Some herds numbering between 20,000 and 35,000 came ashore in Alaska in 2014 and 2015.\nThese were the first haul-outs of this size seen, and it appears the problem is only getting worse. Some scientists believe that by the year 2035, there will be no sea ice left in these areas during the summer months, which could spell disaster for the walrus.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Baboon Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Baboon-facts.html", "text": "baboon Facts\nPortrait of a Mandrill\nThere are five species of old world monkeys known as baboons. The olive, yellow, chacma, hamadryas and guinea baboons of the genus papio. The mandrill, which is the monkey with the colorful face, was once classified in the same genus as the baboons, but was moved to its own in 1970.\nAnother large terrestrial monkey often referred to as a baboon is the gelada, a dramatic looking animal with bare red flesh over its heart. Although the mandrill and gelada are not technically baboons, they are very closely related and have very similar lifestyles, and so are often included in discussions of baboons.\nBaboons are very distinctive looking monkeys inhabiting much of Africa and some areas of Asia. They have long, almost dog-like snouts, very close-set eyes, and their arms and legs are almost the same length, so they walk very much like a dog.\nSometimes referred to as \"dog monkeys\" baboons are very common in the African landscape. They are very social animals that live in large, lively groups called \"troops\" of up to 100 members.\nBaboons spend the majority of the day walking on all fours on the ground. They retire to the trees at night, and are very good climbers, but like all Old World monkeys their tail is not prehensile and cannot assist in climbing other than with balance.\nThe mandrill is the largest monkey species and has just a stump of a tail.\nGrooming, feeding together, and general socializing are key to the well being of the baboon troop. Baboons are very vocal and communicate not only with about 40 different distinct vocalizations but with numerous hand and arm gestures and very expressive faces.\nThey have very mobile lips, cheeks and brows, and have distinct expressions for submission, begging and initiating play. Baboons make allot of eye contact with each other and are very affectionate, holding hands, hugging, and of course, mutually grooming.\nBaboons are one of the few animals other than humans that have been seen \"staring into each others eyes\".\nThe large troop splits into smaller units for foraging during the day, and and is made up of closely related females and their young, with unrelated males trying to gain favor or dominance over females.\nBaboon society is generally rather peaceful and cooperative with multiple adults assisting in the rearing of youngsters and troops actively involved in the defense of all members. Some species, the chacma and hamadryas in particular, and some individual troops prove to be much more violent, however, and fighting among males to gain dominance may also include infanticide.\nThere is extreme size difference between the sexes with adult males usually at least twice as large as adult females. The hamadryas baboon male develops an amazing white mane as it matures, and of course, the mature male mandrill has a colorful snout of red, white and blue, with a ruff of golden fur under his chin and similar colors on his rump. In fact, the male mandrill is probably the most colorful mammal in the animal kingdom. - Baboon Facts\nBaboon lifestyle\ntroop of yellow baboons\nolive baboon closeup\nTroops of loud and energetic olive and yellow baboons are an iconic sight on the African savanna. These baboons are the most common of the baboon species and some of the largest monkey species overall.\nThey are extremely similar and there is some question as to whether they should be considered separate species. The yellow baboon is lighter in color, slightly smaller and has a different home range than the olive. Both have almost identical lifestyles . Neither of these species are currently endangered, but as human beings encroach upon more of their territory conflicts are more common.\nToday, human beings are the number one predator of baboons. Baboons have been known to raid crops, and even break into barns and outbuildings. They will kill and eat farm fowl and small animals such as goats and rabbits as well.\nFarmers defend their crops by hunting down baboons and troops that have raided barns or buildings have been hunted down by entire towns of people.\nThe very smart and resourceful baboon has put itself in harms way through its own nerve and cleverness. Another potential threat to these animals is an increase in their use in research laboratories. Recent international agreements have slowed and stopped much of the use of chimpanzees in research facilities, but the baboon and other primate species remain unprotected and are being used to fill a void.\nThe baboon is a remarkably bright creature that not only has a very complex social life, but is also similar to our ancestors in its ability to adapt to life outside of heavy forest.\nThe olive and yellow baboons willingness to forage for a large variety of foods from roots to insects, to, on rare occasions, small prey like birds and fawns, and its cooperative, relatively peaceful society find it living in the open savanna where few other primates have ever flourished.\nOut on the savanna the olive and yellow baboons regularly encounter some of the largest predators in the world. Lions, leopards, African wild dogs and hyenas have all hunted baboons, and the baboon troop keeps a wary eye out for all these animals.\nIn general, baboons are very quick, and tend to avoid capture by some of these larger beasts, and baboons have been known to torment large predators, particularly old male lions, when they are sure the odds are in their favor.\nIn addition to interactions with unfriendly neighbors, baboons have been observed interacting playfully with mongooses and chimpanzees. These species have overlapping ranges where forests meet the open plains.\nChimps and baboons will occasionally wrestle and tickle-fight with eachother and both species make sounds of laughter when engaging eachother\nOn the darker side, chimpanzees have been known to actively hunt baboons, and the much larger, more intelligent chimps have a huge advantage when they choose to use it. - Baboon Facts\nIt Is Baboooon!!\nbaboon reproduction\nbaby baboons\nbaboon mother and infant\nThe female baboon comes into season about every 37 days and this is marked by pronounced sexual swelling. The genitals engorge and are bright pink in color indicating her condition. Her entire rump swells during this time and males show great interest.\nBaboons are promiscuous and both males and females have multiple partners. Sometimes males will be possessive of certain females and fights may break out, but it is not only the most aggressive or dominant males that have a chance to mate.\nMales will form friendships with females where they will escort, groom, share food and even help in the rearing of youngsters in order to gain favor with a female. Sometimes this works, sometimes she goes off with another more attractive suitor. Friendships between unrelated males and females may be lifelong, whether or not they involve sexual activity.\nFemales show their interest in a male by presenting their rump. The female will be pregnant for 6 months and give birth to one, very rarely two youngsters. The baby is helpless, but eyes are open and the infant is well furred.\nThe newborn baboon also has the typical young primates ingrained gripping reflex, and is able to hold itself against its mothers belly with tightly grasping hands and feet almost immediately after birth. Infants ride against the mothers stomach for the first several weeks, and then begin to ride on her back, usually in an upright position like a little jockey.\nAs youngsters begin to explore, they spend lots of time with their peers in active and exciting playgroups overlooked by several moms. Mothers are cooperative in the rearing of young and are protective of their friends youngsters.\nMothers can also be seen giving little lessons to groups of youngsters, and sharing food with multiple kids in the neighborhood. Males can be helpful with child rearing as well, and will also actively defend any youngster from predators.\nThe baboon society is matrilineal in form, with mothers, daughters and grandmothers staying together for their lifetimes. The social rank of the mother is usually passed along to the daughter. Young females stay with their troop for life, young males usually move on to another troop where they earn their way in by winning favor with females and older males by submissive grooming and friendship behaviors, or in some species, with active fighting to gain rank.\nThis period in a young males life is called \"dispersal\" and usually occurs sometime around the 7th or 8th year. Males will occasionally live in several different troops over their lifetime.\nThe hamadryas baboons are the exception to this lifestyle, having a different type of society with smaller groups of either one dominant male with a harem, or bachelor males. There is some agression between males and females among the hamadryas baboons, and lots of conflict between competing males.\nIn all baboon societies, as with many primates, there is a degree of infanticide that takes place, when male dominance roles are being disputed. - Baboon Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Mature males develop massive canines that they use more often as a threat than anything else.\nThey usually display these fangs with a big slow-motion mock yawn - like a huge, silent roar.\nInside those big mouths is another interesting specialty. Baboons have cheek pouches similar to hamsters where they may smuggle some foodstuffs they don t have time to eat right away. When they are ready for a snack they push against the cheek from the outside and pull out some fruit or nuts that they can then commence eating.\nwhy do baboon have red butts?\nSpeaking of cheeks, the \"cheeks\" on the rear of the baboon are also specialized.\nBecause baboons sit square on their rumps instead of squatting like some other monkey species, their butts are covered with hairless pads of calloused skin called \"ischial callouses\". This skin has no nerve endings and provides a permanent cushion for the baboon. There is also a bit of a ridge on the pads which allows for a secure seat on a thin branch. Baboons often sleep in an upright seated position on a tree branch, and this calloused area is believed to protect them and keep them secure in the trees.\nBoth sexes in all baboon species have these calloused areas, and the pads will vary in color. The males of some species have red butts occasionally too, in times of heightened aggression or during mating.\nSo, with a large area of skin being hairless for the purpose of comfortable seating, the exposed skin has evolved over time to become an indicator of sorts as well. When female baboons come into season, their entire genital region, including the rump cushion, engorges and turns red. This alerts males to her fertility. Once she is impregnated, the redness subsides, and when she has a lactating youngster it is at its least red, because she will not generally be ovulating again until the baby is weaned.\nIn a fascinating twist, it has been observed that some females with infants may actually falsely become reddened when a new male has taken over the troop. Since he is intent on mating with all females in the troop, the new male often kills any infants in order for the mother to come back into season and be willing to mate with him.\nResearchers have recently observed females with infants becoming red and swollen immediately after the new male gains control of the troop. She will mate with the male at this time, but is not actually ovulating, and will not become pregnant from these matings, however her swelling, redness, and willingness to mate may keep the new male from harming her infant. - amazing!\nassorted wonderful baboons!\na few more baboon facts\nbaboons on the move\nBaboons have cheek pouches like hamsters\nThe mandrill is the largest monkey species\nBaboons spend most of their time on the ground - not in trees\nBaboons threaten each other with slow-motion \"yawns\" displaying their canine teeth\nBaboons walk on all-fours like a dog\nBaboons have lighter coloered skin on their eyelids and they will flash their lids to communicate.\nMale baboons are usually twice as large as female baboons - sometimes even larger\nBaboons do not use tools, but have been known to throw rocks, hit things with sticks, and wash some food items - Baboon Facts!\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Primates\nFamily Cercopithecidae\nGenus Papio\nBaboon Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT male female infant troop HOME HABITAT LIFESPAN FAVORITE FOOD Africa, Asia savanna 20-30 years fruits, insects ENEMIES GENDER DIFFERENCE AVG.

Some populations of the same species are sometimes observed in the Gulf of Mexico and in oceans off the coast of Australia and New Zealand. The lion\u2019s mane jelly is named so because of its long, trailing tentacles that resemble the thick mane of a lion. With tentacles measuring up to 120 feet, it is the largest species of jellyfish in the world.\nScientific Classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Cnidaria Class: Scyphozoa Order: Semaeostomeae Family: Cyaneidae Genus: Cyanea Scientific Name: Cyanea capillata\nPhysical Description and Appearance\nSize: These jellyfish vary in size, with the larger individuals (that live in the Arctic Ocean) having a bell diameter of 2-2.4 m (6 ft 7 in-8 ft) and the smaller ones (found in the lower latitudes) having a bell diameter of about 30-80 cm (12-31.5 in). The larger specimens have tentacles measuring 30-36.5 m (100-120 ft), which is bigger than a blue whale.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish\nWeight: The largest of the lion\u2019s mane jellyfish could weigh up to 480 lbs while average-sized specimens weigh about 200 lbs.\nColor: Larger individuals range from bright crimson to dark purple and the smaller specimens are usually lighter orange to tan, but sometimes they can be colorless.\nBody: Their bell consists of eight lobes or lappets, each of which consists of 70-150 tentacles set in four distinct rows. The rhopalium, a balance organ, exists at each of the indentations along the edge of the bell.\nMouth: Situated on the underside of the bell, the mouth has broad oral arms, which contain numerous stinging cells.\nDistribution\nIt is distributed across the Arctic, northern Pacific, and northern Atlantic Oceans. It is commonly found in the Irish Sea, English Channel, North Sea, and western Scandinavian waters. The lion\u2019s mane jelly is sometimes found in the southwestern Baltic Sea.\nWhat Kind of Habitats do Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish live in\nThey live in the open ocean and are typically found drifting within 20 m (65 ft) of the surface.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Habitat Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Pictures\nLifespan\nThe lion\u2019s mane jellyfish, like other jellyfish species, have a short lifespan. They live for only one year during which they go through four developmental stages, which include larval, polyp, ephyrae, and medusa stages.\nDiet\nBeing a voracious predator, the giant jellyfish captures and eats zooplankton, small shrimps, rotifers, copepods, ctenophores, and small jellyfish species like moon jellyfish.\nBehavioral Characteristics\nThese jellyfish are constant swimmers and can travel great distances with the help of marine currents.\nThey also glide vertically in order to move around in the water.\nThey are usually most active during the summer and autumn because they develop into their adult size by this time of the year and are swept to the shore with the currents.\nThey form shoals, which mean they swim together in large groups. Swarms that are several kilometers long are observed in the North Sea and off the coast of Norway.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Sting Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Image\nAdaptations\nThe rhopalia, present along the margin of the jellyfish\u2019s bell, are balance organs that help it position itself.\nIts tentacles are extremely sticky and are equipped with stinging cells called nematocysts that contain venom used for stunning and capturing prey, as well as escaping from predators.\nIt has bioluminescent ability, which means it can produce light and glow in the dark.\nMating and Reproduction\nThe lion\u2019s mane jellyfish, like other jellyfish species, can reproduce sexually in their medusa stage and asexually in their polyp stage. Female jellyfish carry the fertilized eggs in their tentacles, where these eggs mature into larvae. Once the larvae become old enough, the female jellyfish attach them to a firm surface where they develop into polyps. These polyps start reproducing asexually, forming small creatures known as ephyrae. Each of these ephyrae gets separated from the stacks, eventually turning into the medusa form and then become full-grown jellyfish.\nConservation Status\nThe lion\u2019s mane jellyfish is not in danger of extinction and has not received any special status from the IUCN Red List.\nLion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish Size Picture of Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish\nInteresting Facts"}

The lion is referred to as the king of the jungle, but hyenas will sometimes kill them when they are injured and the hyena is extremely hungry.\nThe largest predator of the lion is the human. Humans will kill these creatures out of fear for their lives, out of traditional burial practices and as an act of bravery in front of other people. They are not commonly killed to be eaten and are generally only killed for the sport of the hunt of lions. They hunting of lions is not necessarily bad and can help keep humans safe.\nLions sometimes have to fight other male lions for the females in the pride or for the food that has been brought back by the females. These fights are vicious and are among the most common reasons that lions are killed. When lions fight each other, one of the lions generally ends up dying as a result of the fight. This is not technically considered to be predator behavior, but often qualifies as it because the lions have very few predators in the natural world.\nADVERTISEMENT"}

The only males allowed to mate are the dominant males; however, younger males will sneak into rookeries and attempt to mate with the females without the dominant male noticing. The dominant males will guard and mate with as many as 30 females in one mating season. Females give birth to a single pup between mid-May and July after a gestation period that lasts for approximately 12 months. Females care for their offspring for up to three years, nursing them for as long as a year, sometimes longer. Males are not much involved in parental care but will guard all of the females they have mated with. Both males and females reach maturity between three to six years of age. Due to competition with other males, most bulls are unlikely to successfully breed until eight or ten years of age."}

They prey on animals such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. Male lions protect their territory and guard the cubs while the lionesses are hunting.\nDid you know?\nLionesses give birth to about four to six cubs at a time. The cubs are born in a den.\nMale lions are known for their large manes. The manes usually become darker as the lions grow older.\nLions spend the majority of their day sleeping. They could sleep for about 16 to 20 hours everyday. Sometimes they are found sleeping in trees, as they are good climbers.\nA lion\u2019s roar keeps predators at bay and could be heard up to 5 miles away. Lions can sense a predator up to one mile away.\nMale and female lions rub against each other as a way to bond with each other.\nLions in the wild could live up to 10 to 15 years of age. Lions in captivity could live up until they are 25 years old.\nLions can live without drinking water for about 4 to 5 days. Lions have been on display at zoos since the 18th century."}

Just imagine a \"newborn\" that is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds!\nGiraffe mothers are pregnant for 15 months, giving the embryo time to develop to such a large size, and when ready to come out, the baby comes front feet first, with the neck and head stretched out over the front knees in a sort of \"superman\" position.\nThis comes in handy because a mother giraffe gives birth in a standing position, which means the newborn comes into the world falling from a height of over 5 feet.\nThe fall and the impact break the umbilical cord and the natal sac, and the jolt of landing causes the little giraffe to take it's first breath!\nUnharmed by the fall, the infant will take up to an hour to rest where it landed, as the mother licks the infant to stimulate circulation and dry the skin, but Africa's infants must be ready to run with the herd, and remarkably, the newborn giraffe is standing, walking and even running, within about an hour of being born.\nGiraffe babies are born with their eyes open, and look very much like miniature adults, but their little horns, called \"ossicones\" are folded flat against their head while they are inside the mother, and take a few hours to start to stand up straight.\nBoth males and females have horns known as \"occicones\", which are formed from cartilage and covered with skin. Females have thinner occicones, that are tufted with longer hair on top. Males occicones are larger, have knobs on the ends, and become bald on top as they mature.\nbaby giraffe close-up\nThe baby also has a shorter neck, percentage wise than an adult, no doubt to fit more neatly in the womb.\nThe baby giraffe eats only mothers milk for the first four to six months of life, and then begins to sample low growing young shoots and leaves. The leaves of the acacia tree are one of the staples of a giraffes diet. Occasionally, mother giraffes are observed reaching high for a variety of leaves, and bringing them down to their youngster to sample, teaching them what is edible, and where the best feeding is.\nWithin the first year of life, the young giraffe has doubled in height, with quite a bit of this being added neck length, very necessary as they begin to forage and eat on their own.\nFemales share in the raising of young with little \"day-care\" groups of youngsters called creches, that the mothers will take turns supervising.\nnewborn giraffe\nThe female is pregnant for about 15 months, and gives birth standing upright.\nThe newborn hits the ground from a height of 5 or 6 feet, the fall of which breaks the umbilical cord and the natal sac. A newborn baby giraffe stands about 5 or 6 feet at the top of the head, and they can weigh between 140 and up to 200 pounds.\nAt birth, the occicones are folded back against the head, but spring up in a matter of hours. Baby giraffes often have alot of hair on their occicones, and have amazingly long eyelashes too.\nNo doubt because of the difficulties of folding up in the womb, the babies neck is not as long, in proportion to the body, as the neck of an adult. Over the first few weeks and months of life, as the baby grows, its neck gets proportionately longer, and at about 4 months old, the youngster is using its long neck to browse for leaves in branches as high as 10 feet.\nGiraffes stay with their mothers between 18 months and 2 years, and females in particular, may travel with her from time to time throughout their lives.\nYoung males may be sexually mature at 6 years old, but will have to wait, usually until they are in their teens, to compete for an opportunity to mate. Males take no part in the rearing of the young, but any groups traveling together will watch for eachother, keep lookout while others drink, and have been known to defend eachother against predators.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

So what kind of special adaptions must occur in order to make such a unique body function properly?\nTo start with, the giraffe has a 25 pound heart capable of creating the extreme blood pressure required to pump blood 8 feet up to the brain. But when the giraffe lowers its head to eat or drink, the blood rushing down at such high pressure would cause the blood vessels to burst. Pressure sensors along the neck\u2019s arteries monitor the blood pressure and activate contraction of the artery walls (along with other mechanisms) to counter this increase in pressure.\nThe blood leaving the giraffe\u2019s heart has to do more than just reach the level of the head, it has to be at a high enough pressure to pass through all the fine capillaries that supply the brain and other organs. To achieve this, the blood leaves the heart at a pressure of 200-300 mm Hg which is probably the highest blood pressure of any living animal.\nA giraffe\u2019s blood pressure is so high that it would rupture the blood vessels of any other animal, but the arterial walls are much thicker than in other animals, and their skin is so tightly stretched over the body that it acts almost like an anti-gravity suit, keeping the giraffe safely inside the giraffe! - Amazing!\na few more giraffe baby facts\nThe giraffe is the largest ruminant and the worlds tallest animal\nMale giraffes can be 18 feet tall at the top of the horns\nGiraffes have 2 to 5 horns called \"occicones\"\nThe giraffes neck is 6 to 8 feet long and can weigh over 600 pounds\nGiraffes \"chew their cud\" just like cows\nGiraffes defend themselves by kicking\nA giraffes kick can kill a lion!\nThe giraffes tongue is about 18 inches long\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Giraffidae\nGenus Giraffa\nSpecies camelopardalis\nGiraffe Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd HOME HABITAT LIFESPAN FAVORITE FOOD Africa Asia savanna 20-25 years acacai leaves ENEMIES GENDER DIFFERENCE AVG.

The tip of the snout can actually bend from side to side at nearly 90 degrees.\nThey use their powerful, long front claws and pig-like snout to root out insects, reptiles and just about anything else edible that they can find in the ground.\nThe Mexican raccoon, or white-nosed coati, is about 12 inches at the shoulder, and weighs between 5 and 20 pounds.\nThe South American coati is very slightly smaller and may be reddish in color. The snout is darker in color, and they may not have any rings on their tails.\nBoth the mountain species of coati are smaller still, more like a squirrel, ranging from 3 to 10 pounds. They have well-defined masks and ringed tails.\nAll the species are foragers who will eat virtually anything from fruits and vegetables to fish and small birds.\nInsects are a staple, since they hunt mostly on the ground, rutting with their nose, and will consume slugs, beetles, worms and crickets too.\nInvertebrates such as tarantulas and scorpions are on the menu also, and coatis seem to be immune to their bites and stings.\nThe Mexican raccoon is occasionally kept as a pet, and may be very affectionate and playful.\nThey are extremely intelligent and curious, and can be trained to use a litter pan, so there is a temptation to give them the run of the house.\nBut don't forget these busy animals have a powerful urge to dig, since that's how they acquire their food in the wild, and they may cause quite a bit of damage in the average home, pulling up floor tiles and carpeting.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Giraffe Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Types-of-Giraffes.html", "text": "Types of Giraffes\nPortrait of a Giraffe\nThere are several types of giraffes including 4 species and numerous subspecies. The giraffe and its closest relative the okapi are the last survivors of the once plentiful Giraffidae family. While the okapi is a solitary, forest dwelling creature rarely seen, the giraffe is a true show stopper, herds of which wander in surprising abundance across the African savanna.\nToday the giraffe is the tallest animal on Earth, with males topping out at about 18 feet at the top of the horns (called occicones), and 11 feet at the shoulder. Although no fossil trail exists, it is assumed the giraffe developed its remarkable physique and out-survived its relatives, by reaching for the treetops.\nAs taller individuals ate leaves and fruits unavailable to shorter individuals, the giraffe thrived, and became more and more specialized. While the 6 to 8 foot long, 600 pound neck is most obvious, the giraffes entire body is a masterpiece of specialization.\nViewed from the side, the giraffes shoulder region is towering, with a highly elongated pectoral girdle which gives the illusion that the front legs are longer than the rear. Front and rear legs are about the same length, however, between 5.5 and 6 feet long.\nWhile the relatively short back has vertebrae of a median size, the vertebrae of the neck, are stretched to about 11 inches long, They still have the standard 7 neck vertebrae found in most mammals, including us, but they are not only elongated, but also articulate far more than ours.\nThe neck is supported by powerful muscles and reinforced ligaments which anchor to vertebrae between the shoulder blades, and form a hump where the back and neck meet.\nThe head is refined, streamlined and equipped with an 18 inch long tongue for even further reach.\nBoth males and females have horns known as \"occicones\", which are formed from cartilage and covered with skin. Females have thinner occicones, that are tufted with longer hair on top. Males occicones are larger, have knobs on the ends, and become bald on top as they mature.\nThough the giraffe is the worlds tallest animal, it is, especially by mammals standards, remarkably peaceful, with very little territorial drive, and aggression between males limited to largely harmless \"necking\" displays.\nMales and females mingle, young are protected by herd members, and individuals take turns looking out for eachother while drinking or napping.\nTheirs is also a very quiet life. While some may incorrectly report that giraffes make no sounds at all, they are, in fact, diverse in vocalizations, emitting grunts, snorts and flute-like sounds of different meaning, but infrequently, and at very low volume.\nThe length between lungs and vocal chords could limit production and volume, but new research has also found that giraffes make sounds we simply can't hear because they are too low a frequency. In 2015, it was discovered and documented that giraffes in zoos hummed to eachother. This humming was only at night, and only in the dark, and far too low for humans to hear. - Amazing!\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

This number changes and is debated because of a lack of study on the subject, and because color and pattern variations occurring between animals in the same herd, or even the same family, occasionally appear to be those of different subspecies.\nIt is most likely that there are less than the commonly reported 9 subspecies, but it is also very likely that there is more than 1 species - and most probably 4 species of giraffe.\nWhy? Well, one observation of some subspecies as they encounter each other is that interbreeding is not taking place within some of the types. Interbreeding usually takes place within subspecies, and so the reluctance for these herds to intermingle suggests that there may, in fact, be more than one species of giraffe.\nMore recent DNA research supports this possibility, and some authorities who are studying the herds in the wild are leaning towards the idea that there are actually three to six separate species of giraffe.\nWe strongly lean towards this theory, but as is often the case with zoological classification, particularly of such iconic mammals as the giraffe, this concept is being hotly disputed, and if any changes are to take place, it will be a number of years before the idea of three or more distinct giraffe species is accepted.\nRemember, of course, that it was argued for decades that the Giant Panda was not a bear, before it was finally reclassified as ursine.\nFrom a conservation standpoint, if we lump all giraffes into one species, the critically low numbers of some populations becomes obscured.\nFull species status for some subspecies might allow conservationists to focus resources and save them from extinction.\nThe total number of giraffes in the wild has dropped about 30% in the last decade and hovers at less than 100,000.\nPerhaps most telling of the plight of the giraffe is that some subspecies, like the Angolan giraffe, are named for countries or regions they no longer exist in.\nAngolan giraffe\nThe Angolan giraffe, also called the \"smoky\" giraffe, has numerous thriving herds in Namibia, Zambia and Botswana, but no longer exists in Angola.\nWith a total population of approx. 15,000 individuals, many roam the Etosha National Park in Namibia, where they are regularly observed and photographed by tourists on safari.\nThe Angolan is light in color with large, uneven, rectangular spots that are darker in front but fade out down the legs, and often disappear across the rump, giving them their \"smoky\" look.\nKordofan giraffe\nA lovely, pale-colored giraffe, the Kordofan has one of the less distinct coat patterns. Sometimes rectangular, sometimes more star-shaped, the spots are usually quite far apart and the pattern never goes below the knee.\nThese giraffes number only around 2000 individuals. They live in isolated herds throughout Chad, Cameroon, Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which are areas of Africa that have been war zones in recent years.\nThankfully, nearly half the population resides in Zakouma National Park in Chad, where they enjoy the relative safety of a dedicated conservation effort.\nmaasai giraffe\nThe Maasai giraffe is the most abundant of the subspecies, with an estimated population of just under 37,000. They occur across Kenya and Tanzania along the Maasai Mara river.\nMaasai giraffes are tall, with a very dark and distinct pattern of crooked spots that look like vine leaves or distorted stars.\nMales in particular, have very dark spots, and like most giraffes, get even darker as they age. The coats are beautiful, and illegal poaching for hides has seen the Maasai population dwindle over the last few decades.\nNubian giraffe\nThe Nubian giraffe has large, irregular, rectangular spots on a cream-colored body. The pattern does not extend far down the legs, and the belly is also without spots.\nNubian giraffes often have extra ossicones, like the Rothschilds giraffe, and there is speculation that they may be the same subspecies, or perhaps may both belong together as their own species.\nThe nubian giraffe numbers only about 600 individuals, and are found in South Sudan and West Ethiopia. Many exist under the protection of the Gambella National Park in Ethiopia where they are studied by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation.\nReticulated giraffe\nThe spectacular Reticulated giraffe is known by several other names including \"Netted\" and \"Webbed\".\nFound in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia, where it is also known as the Somali giraffe, the Reticulated has a rich, bright pattern of large, smooth, chestnut-colored rectangles against a clear, cream-colored background. The face is also reddish-brown in color, and the tail tends to be quite long.\nThese giraffes are a prize for poachers and their population has decreased dramatically since the year 2000. Only 8,000 individuals survive in the wild today.\nThankfully, Kenya has cracked down on poaching in recent years, and is working to maintain its current herds.\nRothschilds giraffe\nThe Rothschilds giraffe is one of the subspecies that is strongly suspected of being a separate species. These large, robust giraffes live in Kenya and Uganda in numbers of less than 1500.\nRothschilds have large, dark rectangular patches that stop at the knees. The background color is beige to nearly white, and these giraffes frequently have extra occicones.\nThese are the giraffes seen visiting people at their second floor windows at the famous \"Giraffe Manor\" in Nairobi.\nGiraffe Manor is a sanctuary for Rothschilds giraffes which was developed by Jock and Betty Leslie-Melville in the 1970's, and continues to preserve them to this day with a breeding program and orphanage.\nIt operates as an amazing hotel and safari park, while doing amazing conservation work, and spreading awareness of the rarity of these animals.\nSouthern giraffe\nThe Southern giraffe, or South African giraffe, is one of the more common subspecies at an estimated population of 17,000. They can be found in areas across the southern half of Africa including Zimbabwe and Botswana.\nEfforts are underway to reintroduce both the Southern giraffe and the Angolan giraffe to Mozambique, whose government has implemented numerous conservation efforts for local wildlife.\nThe Southern giraffe has jagged, star or leaf-shaped spots on a beige background with a reddish tinge. The pattern often covers the legs. The mane is usually red, but the tail tuft is black.\nthornicroft's giraffe\nThornicroft's giraffe is slightly smaller than some other subspecies. It's leaf-shaped pattern is reddish-brown on a light tan background that continues down the legs. The mane is usually red with a black tail tuft. Tails are slightly shorter on this subspecies.\nThey number approximately 1500 individuals, and are very similar to the Maasai giraffe in appearance, but with a lighter overall color. Some scientists beleive the Maasai and the Thornicrofts belong in their own species together.\nThese giraffes are isolated from other giraffes, occurring in only one area of Africa, the South Luangwa Valley of Zambia. Most of the population lives within the borders of a game preserve in the valley, where they are largely protected from poachers.\nIt is believed that there are no examples of Thornicroft's giraffes in captivity anywhere in the world. This subspecies is also called the Rhodesian giraffe, and the Luangwa giraffe.\nwestern giraffe\nStrongly considered to be it's own species, the Western giraffe, or West African giraffe, is the rarest of the 9 subspecies.\nThese giraffes were near extinction in the 1990's when it dwindled down to only 50 individuals, but the government of Niger fought hard to re-establish them, and today, approximately 400 Western giraffes exist in Niger.\nThe Western giraffe has a distinctive appearance, with large, polygonal spots of a gold or tan color, set wide apart against an ivory background. The pattern does not continue below the knees, and the belly has no spots.\nThe light color has earned the Western giraffe the nickname \"Blonde\" giraffe or \"White\" giraffe.\na few more giraffe facts\ngiraffes snuggling\nThe giraffe is the largest ruminant and the worlds tallest animal\nMale giraffes can be 18 feet tall at the top of the horns\nGiraffes have 2 to 5 horns called \"occicones\"\nThe giraffes neck is 6 to 8 feet long and can weigh over 600 pounds\nGiraffes \"chew their cud\" just like cows\nGiraffes defend themselves by kicking\nA giraffes kick can kill a lion!\nThe giraffes tongue is about 18 inches long\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Giraffidae\nGenus Giraffa\nSpecies camelopardalis\nGiraffe Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd HOME HABITAT LIFESPAN FAVORITE FOOD Africa Asia savanna 20-25 years acacai leaves ENEMIES GENDER DIFFERENCE AVG.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Anteater Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Anteater-facts.html", "text": "anteater Facts\nPortrait of a Giant Anteater\nThe anteaters are four species of unusual creatures with extraordinarily specialized tongues, mouths and stomachs. Created with insect consumption in mind, the anteater has a toothless, tube-shaped mouth and an extremely elongated head that houses the animal worlds most elaborate tongue.\nThe tongue actually rolls up at the back of the anteaters cranium and is attached to the sternum. When fully extended, an anteaters tongue is almost two times the length of the entire head.\nThe tongue is thin, sometimes bright red in color, and covered with hundreds of little hooks. These hooks, along with copious amounts of sticky saliva, capture tiny insects and deliver them straight down the throat without chewing.\nOnce inside the stomach, hundreds of ants, termites and other insects are crushed by a powerful and ever churning gizzard. Like birds, anteaters intentionally ingest fine gravel and small pebbles, which line the gizzard and help demolish the food.\nMost closely related to sloths and also, not surprisingly, armadillos, anteaters are rather primitive animals with a simple, mostly solitary lifestyle.\nAlthough they all survive almost exclusively on insects, each species has different ways of acquiring their meals.\nThe rarely seen silky anteater, native to Central and South America, is an arboreal animal, spending its life in the mid-range tree line, and rarely walking on the ground.\nThe medium-size tamandua, or collared anteaters, from South America, move freely from the trees to the forest floor.\nAlso native to Central and South America, the massive and fascinating giant anteater is terrestrial and spends its time exclusively on the ground, foraging through termite mounds and anthills. - Anteater Facts\nthe giant anteater\ngiant anteater foraging\nThe giant anteater is the largest insectivore on earth, with males reaching an impressive 120 pounds at maturity.\nSupporting such mass in ant-sized increments is hard work. The giant anteater is diurnal, out and about in the heat of the day, sleeping at night, and spending most of its time using its impressive sense of smell to find ant hills and termite mounds.\nThe anteater acts fast when it finds a mound, ripping straight through the walls with its huge and powerful claws.\nMoving quickly is key because, although the anteater is covered with thick, mop-like fur, it is not immune to the stings and bites of ants and termites.\nThe giant anteater will eat as rapidly as possible, its amazing tongue moving in and out 150 times a minute- more than twice a second! And then it's off to the next mound.\nScientists theorize that the anteater is such an efficient hunter that if it wasn't bothered by stings it would end up wiping out entire mounds.\nAs it is, with attacks of only a few minutes in length, the insect colony can rebuild and go on to provide the next anteater with a three minute feast. - Anteater Facts\nawesome anteaters\nAnteater reproduction\nGiant Anteater mother and baby\nAll the anteater species are solitary animals. Giant anteaters in particular, spend time strictly within their own territories which they mark with anal gland secretions and claw markings\nIf individuals run into each other it is usually uneventful, but they rarely socialize.\nOnce a year in mating season they come together in pairs and will stay together for a few days. The male will sometimes remain for awhile longer, but generally the pup is raised by its mother only.\nDo to her unique structure, a mother anteater can't carry her baby in her mouth, or lift it in her arms, so when it's time to shove off, he baby anteater instinctively crawls on top of its mother, and is carried on her back for the first part of its life.\nThe mother will lay down and scoop the baby beneath her where it will nurse for up to an hour at a time, getting all of its nutrients from mothers milk for the first four weeks.\nAt about a month old the baby will begin exploring and walking short distances on its own, but the mother will carry its baby for about a year in most cases, which makes for quite the load.\nAnteaters are quiet and uncomplicated. The baby may emit some squeals and contented sounds when nursing, but otherwise communication is silent.\nYoung anteaters may hang around mom for about three years before branching out on their own - afterall, It's tough to leave such a tireless mommy. - Anteater Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

It is quite large, does not live in trees, resides in more arrid areas than the other species, and is the only anteater without a prehensile tail.\nThe collared anteaters, also called tamanduas or lesser anteaters, spend about 60 percent of their time in the trees. They live in more moisture-rich and greener conditions and can be found in rain forests too. There are two species of collared anteaters, the Northern, also called the vested, and the Southern, both very similar in appearance.\nThey will rip open ant and termite mounds on the ground, but also find a wide variety of insects in the trees, and will slither their tongues into crevices in tree trunks to extract their meals.\nThe tamanduas are most recognized for their tendency to threat displays, where they raise up on their hind legs and puff their chests out.\nThe most rare and unusual of the anteaters is the silky anteater, also known as the pygmy, or dwarf anteater. It is in a separate genus from the other three species and has a much different appearance.\nSilky anteaters are covered with woolly, cream-colored fur. The silky is almost exclusively arboreal and rarely leaves the trees. It is nocturnal and so is not seen often. It is very shy and almost completely silent.\nThe silky anteater has a much shorter face and tongue and eats a slightly different diet of grubs and worms, in addition, of course, to ants.\nIt does not leave the trees to rip open termite mounds. The silky anteater is believed to have a very small territory of only a few trees and is not nearly as active as the other anteater species.\nIt has a remarkably long and powerful prehensile tail and may dangle upside down from a high limb by its tail, while dining on insects on a lower branch. Silkys are also the smallest anteater species at only about 10 inches long and one pound in weight. - Anteater Facts\nanteater personality\nThe generally passive and good-natured anteater looks almost cuddly with its bushy hair-doo, but can put on a rather fierce show when push comes to shove.\nSmaller anteaters can fall prey to jaguars, cougars, pythons, boas, eagles and wolves, so they must be on the alert.\nWhen a predator approaches, the anteaters will put on a boisterous display, standing high up on their hind legs using their strong tails as a tri-pod and arching their backs. They will hold their arms out wide, large claws exposed, in an attempt to look as large as possible.\nIf the bluff fails, they will try to grasp their attacker in a bear-hug. They are not well-equipped for battle having no teeth, but their front limbs are powerful, being designed for hours of strenuous digging, and if they can latch their claws into a foe, they can possibly deter an attack.\nThere have been rare occasions where Giant anteaters have been reported to have killed animals as large as jaguars in self defense. The bluff works well and is employed often, particularly by the tamandua species. They are so likely to display in this fashion, that even captive individuals in zoos will regularly flash their handlers just to be left alone -Anteater Facts\nsilky anteater\na few more anteater facts\nThe giant anteater can consume 30,000 individual insects in one day\nThe giant anteaters hair is 18 inches long\nAnteaters walk on their balled-up fists to keep their claws sharp for digging\nThe silky, or pygmy anteater weighs only about one pound, while the giant anteater can be 120 pounds and 7 feet long.\nThe silky anteater is the smallest but probably the loudest and will emit a very shrill scream when threatened\nAnteaters have no teeth\nA giant anteaters tongue is well over two feet long - or 1.5 to 2 times the length of its head\nAnteater babies ride on their mothers backs for about a year - Anteater Facts!"}

First, they come from different areas of the world. Iguanas are from the Americas while chameleons are from Africa and Asia. Second, they have key anatomical differences like their tails and eyes. Chameleon eyes protrude and can view different directions while iguana eyes are more typical of reptiles.\nWhat Do Chameleons Look Like?\nChameleons have five toes on each of their four feet. These toes help them to climb trees so they can sit in the highest branches. A chameleon\u2019s five toes work kind of like a human\u2019s thumb and fingers. Chameleons also have a tail that can wrap around a tree branch helping them to climb without falling. This reptile has the ability to change the color of its scaly skin. Some chameleons can display bright reds and yellows while others can turn green, black, brown or gray. A chameleon\u2019s color can change with its emotions. It can turn one color when it\u2019s angry and another when its afraid. A chameleon\u2019s range of colors depends a lot on its species. This reptile has a long tongue with a sticky surface used for catching its food. Also, it has eyes that can move in separate directions. This allows a chameleon to see all around it.\nWhat Does a Chameleon Eat?\nThe chameleon is generally an omnivorous animal, although some chameleon species are known to have a more carnivorous diet, and other chameleon species prefer to be vegetarians. A chameleon will generally eat anything though including berries, leaves, fruits, insects, worms, snails and some of the larger chameleon species will also hunt small reptiles. A chameleon that eats insects uses its long, sticky tongue to grab the locusts, grasshoppers, snails and crickets they see. Since many chameleons move very slowly, their long tongue can get them something to eat without needing to chase it. Once the insect goes into a chameleon\u2019s mouth, it is crushed by the reptile\u2019s powerful jaws. Larger varieties of chameleons have been known to eat small birds.\nDoes a Chameleon Drink A Lot of Water?\nA chameleon doesn\u2019t drink a large amount of water but does need constant access to it. A chameleon living in a forest drinks drips of water off the leaves of trees after a rainstorm. Most chameleons look for dripping water instead of looking for a pool on the forest floor.\nHow Big Are Chameleons?\nThe size of a chameleon depends on its species. A Malagasy giant chameleon measures about 27 inches while the Leaf chameleon is only a half inch long. Both of these chameleons live in Madagascar. While some chameleon species weigh less than a pound, others can weigh two to four pounds. The Parson\u2019s chameleon is about the size of a house cat!\nHow Long Do Chameleons Live?\nIn the wild, chameleons can live for about four to eight years. Chameleons that are cared for in a zoo can live up to ten years.\nDo Chameleons Make Any Sounds?\nChameleons do make sound. Many species make a hissing sound if they are angry or feel threatened by something in their environment.\nDo Chameleons Live in Groups?\nChameleons do not live in groups. They prefer to sit alone in the trees and in bushes. Chameleons do get together in order to mate, but otherwise they are known as solitary animals.\nDo Chameleons Make Good Pets?\nAlthough many types of chameleons are sold in pet shops, they don\u2019t make the best pets. These reptiles require a certain environment to enjoy a healthy life. It\u2019s hard to create an environment like that in an aquarium. Plus, they need a special diet to remain healthy.\nDo Chameleons Shed Their Skin?\nChameleons shed their skin like snakes and other reptiles. But, while a snake sheds its skin in one long piece, a chameleon sheds its skin in small sections. A chameleon may shed its skin once a month or once every few months, depending on its species. Along with shedding its skin naturally, a chameleon may shed because it is feeling stressed or it is sick.\nWhat Kingdom do Chameleons belong to?\nChameleons belong to the Kingdom Animalia.\nWhat phylum do Chameleons belong to?\nChameleons belong to the phylum Chordata.\nWhat class do Chameleons belong to?\nChameleons belong to the class Reptilia.\nWhat family do Chameleons belong to?\nChameleons belong to the family Chamaeleonidae.\nWhat order do Chameleons belong to?\nChameleons belong to the order Squamata.\nWhat type of covering do Chameleons have?\nChameleons are covered in Scales.\nIn what type of habitat do Chameleons live?\nChameleons live in tropical forests and deserts.\nWhat are some distinguishing features of Chameleons?\nChameleons have exceptional vision and the ability to change their skin color.\nWhat are some predators of Chameleons?\nPredators of Chameleons include snakes, birds, and mammals.\nWhat is the average clutch size of a Chameleon?\nChameleons typically lay 20 eggs.\nWhat is an interesting fact about Chameleons?\nThere are more than 160 different species of Chameleon!\nWhat is the scientific name for the Chameleon?\nThe scientific name for the Chameleon is Chamaeleonidae.\nHow fast is a Chameleon?\nA Chameleon can travel at speeds of up to 21 miles per hour.\nWhat is the difference between a bearded dragon and a chameleon?\nThe greatest differences between a bearded dragon and chameleon are their size, tails, and eyes. Bearded dragons are smaller than chameleons. Although they share a similar body length, most of a bearded dragon\u2019s body length comes from their somewhat thin tails.

Their powerful bodies, strong jaws and immense speed and agility along with their unparalleled stealth, has lead to them being one of the world\u2019s most apex predators in their natural environments. Closely related to other crocodilians including alligators, caimans, and gharials, crocodiles have changed very little in an evolutionary sense in 200 million years. Unlike other reptile species, crocodilians are archosaurs which is an ancient group of reptiles that also included dinosaurs. Although dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago, crocodiles are thought to have survived so well over time due to the fact that they are so well suited to their environments. Today, there are 13 different crocodile species that are found inhabiting both fresh and saltwater environments throughout North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Their semi-aquatic nature has led to them evolving a number of key adaptations that allow them to survive so successfully in their natural environments.\nRead here to learn more about prehistoric crocodiles.\nCrocodile Anatomy and Appearance\nCrocodiles are large-sized reptiles with thick, scaly skin that is made up of armoured, waterproof plates that both protects them from potential predators and also prevents their bodies from drying out. These scales come in a variety of colours from dull olive and green, to brown, greys and black meaning that they are very easily camouflaged in the surrounding water and vegetation. Like other crocodilian species, their eyes and nostrils are located on the very top of their broad head and snout so that they can lay in wait in the water with almost none of their bodies exposed in order to more successfully ambush prey. Their vertically flattened tails are immensely strong and are used to propel them through the water, as although they do have webbed feet, they do not use them to aid them when swimming. In order to protect them in the water, crocodiles have a special transparent third eyelid which allows them to leave their eyes open but prevents damage from the water. They also have external flaps that close off their ears and nostrils, and a special respiratory system that allows them to remain in the water for up to five hours at a time. Crocodiles range in size from the less than 2 metre long dwarf crocodile to the 7 metre long estuarine crocodile (also known as the saltwater crocodile or \u201csaltie\u201d), which is the world\u2019s heaviest reptile weighing up to 1,000kg.\nRead here to learn about crocodile skulls.\nCrocodile Distribution and Habitat\nCrocodiles are found in a variety of wetland habitats throughout the warmer tropical waters in the southern Hemisphere. Their inability to internally regulate their body temperature means that they rely heavily on the sun to warm their bodies up after it being cooled by spending time in the water. The American Crocodile is the largest crocodilian species in North and South America and is found inhabiting freshwater rivers and lakes, along with brackish coastal waters near estuaries and in lagoons from southern Florida, throughout Central America and into northern parts of South America. Over in Africa, the Nile Crocodile was once widespread in eastern and southern Africa but are now scarcer. They inhabit freshwater marshes, rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps. The world\u2019s largest and most widely dispersed crocodile species is the estuarine crocodile. These formidable reptilian giants are found in river mouths and brackish swamps from the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean, across to and throughout Southeast Asia and down into Australia.\nCrocodile Behavior and Lifestyle\nIn the same way as other reptiles, crocodiles are not able to regulate their body temperature themselves and instead rely heavily on the heat of the sun to warm their enormous bodies up. During the hot daylight hours, they bask in the sun on the riverbanks warming their bodies up from a night of hunting. Smaller species like the dwarf crocodile (which is the least well-known of the crocodile species) are also known to climb trees in order to bask on the branches. Another way crocodiles are able to regulate their body temperature is by bobbing up and down in the water, warming in the sun on the surface and cooling themselves down beneath it. Crocodiles are highly sociable animals that remain together in large, mixed groups of adults and juveniles. However, when the mating season begins, the males become highly territorial and protect their stretch of river bank from intrusion by competitors by rearing their large heads high up into the air and and roaring at intruders. When female Nile crocodiles are attracted by these noises, the males begin to thrash their bodies around and even shoot water into the air from their nostrils.\nCrocodile Reproduction and Life Cycles\nAfter mating, the female crocodile lays between 17 (dwarf crocodiles) and 100 (Nile crocodiles) eggs in a nest made up of soil and vegetation such as leaves, which prevents the eggs from becoming too cold should the nest become flooded during incubation. In areas prone to flooding, they are also known to build nest mounds to raise the eggs out of the danger from flood waters. The incubation period is usually around 3 months long with hatchlings often emerging to coincide with the beginning of the rainy season to prevent their bodies from drying out. Despite their fearsome reputation, female crocodiles are incredibly caring mothers and guard their nests fiercely to protect them from predators until they are ready to hatch. Once the hatchlings begin to emerge, the female crocodile then helps them down to the water by carrying them in the throat pouch in her mouth. Interestingly the thin-shelled, leathery eggs of crocodiles (and indeed other more modern reptile species) was an evolutionary breakthrough for many species as their protective layer and waterproof nature meant that females could lay their eggs on land rather than in water, even in the driest of places, meaning they could be better protected from predators. Typically, crocodiles have a lifespan of 25 to 75 years.\nCrocodile Diet and Prey\nCrocodiles are highly carnivorous and formidable predators and at the top of the food chain in their natural environments. Their inability to chew food has led to the development of ambush hunting techniques, and strong powerful jaws with teeth that are used to tear food apart. Young crocodiles rely heavily on fish, crustaceans, and small mammals, birds and reptiles, but as they grow larger they are able to take much bigger prey species including, deer, zebra and water buffalo. Crocodiles are often more active during the night, with some species being known to venture onto land to catch prey, livestock and in some cases, people (learn more about the most dangerous animals on earth to humans). Due to their highly sociable nature, Nile crocodiles (which predominantly feed on fish), are known to work together in order to cordon fish off in sections of river when they are migrating. Catfish make up a large portion of their natural diets and by keeping their numbers at bay, this allows small fish species to still thrive. These fish (which would ordinarily be quickly eaten by the larger catfish) then provide food for over 40 species of bird, that in return fertilise the waters with their droppings and keep them rich with nutrients so numerous animal species can continue to thrive.\nCrocodiles have a very slow metabolism and can float for a long time without moving. In extreme cases, they seem to be able to go dormant and live off of their own tissues for long periods. Crocodiles can live for up to three years without eating. Learn more about the toughest animals in the world here.\nRead here to know about the crocodile\u2019s kill method, the death roll.\nCrocodile Predators and Threats\nDue to the large size and highly aggressive nature of these apex predators, adult crocodiles have very few predators within their natural environments with the exception of occasional takings by big cats such as lions, jaguars and tigers. The smaller and much more vulnerable juveniles however, are preyed upon by a number of animal species around the world from wild pigs, dogs and large reptiles to birds of prey like eagles. Although they are common in certain areas, crocodiles are threatened throughout much of their natural ranges from hunting, habitat loss and ecological changes further down the food chain due to overfishing or water pollution, which then has an impact on them higher up the food chain.\nCrocodile Interesting Facts and Features\nAlthough most crocodile species inhabit freshwater regions such as swamps, rivers and lakes, there are a number of species that venture into more salty waters around the coasts. American crocodiles are often found in estuaries and lagoons close to the shores but are able to deal with the higher salinity levels by drinking large amounts of freshwater whenever possible, and by removing salt from the body by secreting crocodiles tears through the glands on their face. In periods of drought, they are also known to burrow deep into the mud in order to stop their bodies from drying out and will not eat anything until the water returns. On the other side of the world, estuarine crocodiles have been observed eating pebbles found on the riverbeds. The process of this is thought to help to grind up their food, therefore aiding digestion but also acts as a ballast to help with buoyancy while floating on the surface of the water.\nAlligator vs. Crocodile\nAs noted earlier, the order Crocodilia encompasses crocodiles, alligators, gharial, and caimans. With alligators being common across the Southeastern United States, a common question is what are the key differences between alligators vs. crocodiles? The two differ most in that:\nCrocodiles have a more pointed (V-shaped) snout while an alligators\u2019 is \u2018U-shaped.\u2019\nCrocodile species such as saltwater crocodiles can grow much larger than American alligators.\nAmerican alligators lack a salt gland and primarily live in freshwater while American crocodiles are far more adaptable to saltwater environments.\nCrocodile Relationship with Humans\nThe relationship between crocodiles and people has been a long-lasting point of contention for thousands of years. Their highly aggressive and powerful nature of attack on predators has resulted in numerous human fatalities an on annual basis, with some people actually having been hunted by crocodiles as well as in ambush on the banks of the rivers. Although death toll numbers are declining due to better education and local knowledge about the formidable nature of these enormous reptiles, around 1,000 deaths are still estimated to occur every year. Crocodiles all over the world have also been heavily hunted for their tough, waterproof skins which are used in the manufacture of clothing including coats, bags and shoes. Crocodiles have also been affected heavily by increasing human activity in many regions around the world, with the expansion of settlements and an increase in river traffic due to hunting, fishing and tourism.\nCrocodile Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, although some local populations are thought to be stable, throughout much of their natural ranges the population numbers for all crocodiles species are declining. Out of the 13 different crocodile species, 6 has been listed as Least Concern, 2 have been listed as Vulnerable and 5 have been listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Of all of these species, the Philippine crocodile is by far the most at risk with less than 200 individuals estimated to remain in the wild.\nView all 153 animals that start with C"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Canada Lynx images!\nThe Canada Lynx is known as the Climbing Cat!\nIf you visit the woods in Canada and the Northern United States, do not be surprised if you see a cat high above your head. The Canadian lynx spends a lot of time in trees so that they can jump down on snow hares. It has an unusual-shaped paw that acts like a snowshoe so that it can easily move through the snow. The unusual hair in their ears may act like hearing aids.\n5 Incredible Canada Lynx Facts!\nCanada lynx are outstanding climbers.\nCanada lynx big toe is set at a different angle, which helps to distribute their weight so that they can walk through the snow easily.\nThe number of Canada lynx depends on the number of snowshoe hares. Their numbers follow each other in 11-year cycles.\nCanada lynx do not build a home for their kittens. Instead, they use an available object, like a hollow log.\nThe rare Blue lynx is a result of a genetic mutation.\nCanada Lynx Scientific name\nThe scientific name for Canada lynx is Lynx canadensis. It is a member of the Felidae family. This family also contains the Eurasian lynx (L. lynx) and the Iberian lynx (L. pardinus) in Europe. Lynx or lynxes are both acceptable spellings of the plural. The word lynx comes from the Greek word \u201cto shine,\u201d and it may refer to the lynx\u2019s eyes.\nCanada Lynx Appearance\nThe Canada lynx stands about 24-inches tall at the shoulders. This cat is about 32-to-47-inches long. It is almost twice as big as the average house cat. This cat weighs about 33 pounds while the average house cat weighs about 8.5 pounds. Their tail can be up to 5-inches long.\nThis cat\u2019s body is covered with short hair. The tip of the tail is black. Lynx have a silvery appearance to them because their hair has a minute white tip. The soft coat is marked with dark spots, and it may have thin strips on its body. Lynx have long tufts of hair coming from their cheeks. These longer tufts may help the animal know which way the wind is blowing, which can be essential to its hunting success.\nThis animal has long legs, with the back ones being longer than the front ones. They also have unique large feet. The biggest claw on each paw juts out at an angle. These adaptations on the paws help the lynx distribute its weight better when walking through snow.\nThe tongue of the Canadian lynx is bristly. It contains tiny hook-shaped structures that help the Canadian lynx groom itself. These hook-shaped structure adaptations also help the cat keep water in its mouth when it drinks.\nCanada Lynx on the edge of the ice along Alaska highway at Johnson\u2019s Crossing, Yukon, Canada.\nCanada Lynx Ears\nCanada lynxes also have long tufts of hair in their triangle-shaped ears. These tuffs of hair may be extremely sensitive to sound. Therefore, they may act as a hearing aid to help the Canada lynx know when a predator is nearby.\nLynx have over 20 muscles that help them move their ears. Therefore, they can move each ear in a half-circle. These adaptations allow them to locate prey faster.\nCanada Lynx Behavior\nCanada lynx are quiet and solitary animals. They tend to live a solitary life, except for a brief period when mating. Some biologists have also observed young kittens hunting together for brief periods. These facts may help them survive as a group before they get big enough to find and fight prey independently.\nCanada lynx covers a lot of territory. If the snowshoe hare population is high, then female lynx will cover about 10 square miles while male Canada lynx may cover approximately 22 square miles. If the snowshoe hare population is down, the female may expand their territory up to 81 square miles.\nCanada lynx are quiet animals. They seldom make a sound unless it is mating season. Then, males will scream at each other to try to determine who gets to breed a female. The screaming can continue for hours. The screams start at about 0.7 kHz, rising to about 1.15 kHz before falling to 0.6 kHz. The calls are an inverted V when measured, and they fade out instead of just stopping.\nCanada lynx have excellent eyesight. This outstanding eyesight allows them to see prey at night up to 250 feet away. They do most of their hunting at night and hide during the day.\nCanada Lynx Habitat\nCanada lynx live in successional forests where snowshoe hares are abundant. These habitats include weedy areas, grasslands, old fields and pastures, shrub thickets, and young forests. They would prefer that these areas be as far away from humans as possible. Additionally, they want at least two acres in an undisturbed place. Most would like 10 or more acres in their home range. Most are found in hilly areas where the elevation varies from 975 feet to 8,000 feet. While males almost always have a range all to themselves, the range of females often overlaps.\nCanada lynx also need old-succession forest when it comes time to give birth. These forests provide good cover for the Canada lynx to raise their young. These animals do not build dens. Instead, they choose a home in a fallen log, cave or some other available area.\nCanada Lynx Diet\nCanada lynx feed almost exclusively on snow hares. Over 70% of their diet consists of these animals. They are considered monophagous animals, as they eat only one food. There are other monophagous animals in the world. For example, monarch butterflies eat only milkweed, while giant panda bears eat only bamboo.\nCanada Lynx Predators and Threats\nHumans are the main predator of Canadian lynx. They often kill them for their pelts, which are used to trim some fashion clothing.\nWolves often feed on Canadian lynx. A Canadian lynx can usually climb in the forest to get away from wolves. They can jump up to 25 feet in a single jump. That is about seven times as far as the average human can jump. Most Canadian lynx can jump into trees to escape wolves in the forest, but they are often unable to escape them in the open.\nAnother predator for the Canadian lynx is coyotes, who are usually close to the top predator in areas where these animals live. Coyotes have recently expanded their territory, and they eat the snowshoe hares that the lynx prefer to dine on. Researchers suggest that if more wolves are introduced, they can feed on the coyotes, increasing the snowshoe hare population. In turn, there would be more Canadian lynx.\nCanada Lynx Reproduction and Life Cycle\nFemale Canadian lynx become sexually mature at 21 months. Males become sexually mature at about 33 months.\nFemales come into heat in February or March, and they only have one heat cycle per year. The heat cycle lasts 1-to-2 days. If successful, then a litter of one to nine kittens is born eight to ten weeks later. Each kitten will weigh about 7 ounces at birth.\nThe kittens are born blind, but they will open their eyes at about 10 days. Some kittens will start eating meat that the mother provides at about 30 days. They will continue to eat mom\u2019s milk for about 100 days.\nMales do not help raise the young at all. Young usually stay with their mother for 10 months. Then, the mother pushes them away. They often remain together for a few more months before starting their solitary life.\nThe lifespan of a Canada lynx is about 14 years. By comparison, mountain lions have a lifespan of about 10 years while bobcats have a lifespan of approximately seven years.\nCanada Lynx Population\nThere are thousands of Canada lynx in Canada and Alaska. The United States population of Canada lynx has dramatically shrunk. Yet, there are still stable populations in Maine, Montana, Washington, and Colorado.\nView all 153 animals that start with C"}

The simplest way to remember this is to imagine the first letter of those names capitalized and lying on their flat end. A capital \"D\" - a capitol \"B\" - one hump or two!.\nThe bactrian camel is native to Asia and can be found on the border of Mongolia and China. Its range encompasses both desert and - surprisingly- snowy mountain ranges.\nThe bactrian camel has been domesticated for over 5000 years and only about 1000 to 2000 individuals still exist in the wild.\nThe dromedary camel has been extinct in the wild for several hundred years. There are no wild herds in existence in the native lands of the Middle East and Asia where they first came to be, but some escaped domestic animals roam Australia.\nIt is estimated that the dromedary camel has been domesticated for perhaps 6000 years and has shaped the civilization of the entire world.\nCamels are very specialized animals. Their famous humps are stores not of water, but of fat (which, like all body tissue is largely water) and can sustain them without water for as long as a month in the harshest desert conditions. In an environment where most of the creatures are very small, do to such limited resources and the danger of exposure, the camel is a virtual giant, reaching well over 5 ft at the top of the head and weighing nearly 800 pounds.\nwonderful camels!\nThey maintain themselves in conditions that would kill nearly any other creature, with specialized expanding feet, nostrils they can open and close independently, lips that can chew thorns and even specially shaped blood cells.\nThe red blood cells of camels are are not circular but oval shaped - unlike any other mammal on earth. The theory is that the oval shape allows blood to continue to circulate even if it is thickened from lack of hydration.\nWhen resources are scarce and a camel is living off the fat of its hump, the hump slowly deflates, and may even flop over, particularly in the bactrians, as the contents are depleted. And when a thirsty camel finally arrives at a water source it can easily drink up to 40 gallons in a matter of minutes.\nThe flesh of the hump can be seen to visibly re inflate and even the hollows above the camels eyes will refill within a few moments of replenishing precious fluids.\nPerhaps most importantly, to the people who rely on these animals for their very existence, the camel holds a sacred space.\nThe camel is not the rude, vulgar and unruly creature of myth, but a stately, noble and amiable servant with some minor personality flaws and a wicked sense of humor.\nHere at the encyclopedia we just love camels! So read on... - Camel Facts\nour exceptional partner\ncamel with little boy\nCamels were domesticated over 5000 years ago, and but for a handful of wild bactrians, only domestic camels remain. They have been used mainly as pack animals and for transportation.\nTheir wool can be spun to make felt purses, hats and socks.\nCamel milk is a vital food source for the Bedouins and is a required ingredient in many native recipes. Camel meat is not as common a staple, but camels have been bred for their meat in the past and in some regions today.\nThe first camel saddles date back to 1200 B.C. Camel cavalries have been used in many wars through history, and even the Romans rode camels during some of their African conquests. Camels were found to be useful against armies mounted on horseback because horses tend to be frightened of camels and opposing armies lost control of their mounts when a siege of camels approached.\nCamels are still used in many middle-eastern jurisdictions for border patrols and police duty. And the United States experimented with the idea of a U.S. Camel Corps, using camels as transportation in Texas, New Mexico and the Mojave desert in California in the 1850's. Many of these camels were released and some feral herds roamed the south western states for a few decades.\nCamels are also raised and trained for racing, particularly in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. It was a long tradition that children as young as six years old were used as jockeys, but child jockeys have recently become a human rights issue and several nations have banned the practice.\nRacing camels start competing at 2 years old and can race successfully until 8 or 9 years old. Camels are famous for their medium-tempo pacing gait, but racing camels gallop like thoroughbreds at speeds just as fast - up to 40 miles an hour. Squabbling, wagering and tall tales about camel races and famous race camels are the staple of many cultures. -Camel Facts\ncamel reproduction\nDromedary camel mother and calf\nBactrian camel mother and calf\nCamels are ungulates similar to cows. They have 2 toes on their feet and so are described as \"even toed ungulates\". Wild bactrian camel herds can be as large as 60 individuals. They have a lifestyle typical of many herd animals with females maintaining relative harmony and males jousting for control of \"harems.\"\nMales come into a seasonal heat called a \"rut\" where their testosterone level elevates. They will become unsettled and foam at the mouth.\nBecause males in rut are difficult to handle and the rut may last as long as 4 months, most domestic male camels are gelded. Only the finest bulls remain intact and are able to reproduce.\nDuring the rut, males become single-minded attempting to dominate other males by proving their superiority in relatively civil contests. Neck wrestling, pushing and shoving, lots of bellowing but not allot of damage.\nThe less dominant male will return to a band of \"bachelor\" camels while the dominant male currently in rut mates with the females in the harem. Males come into rut at different times and with varying intensity so the title of head camel changes hands several times during any one breeding season.\nOddly, unlike any other mammal, camels mate sitting down. The mating season lasts about 2 months. Females carry their young for about a 13 to 14 month pregnancy. They deliver only one calf and on very rare occasions twins. The baby is extremely long-legged and takes a bit longer to get to its feet than many other herd animals. The calf may be prone for up to two hours, but by the end of the day will be able to keep up with the herd. Herd members are protective of all calves and adoptions when a mother is ill or killed are common. - Camel Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

These unique physical characteristics allow this massive animal to survive in a bare and exceedingly harsh environment.\nMost dromedary camels live in Africa's immense Sahara desert, where they withstand prolonged temperatures of over 120 degrees during the day, and overnight temps that may plummet to below freezing.\nThe bactrian camel lives in the even more inhospitable Gobi desert and migrates up through the steppes of Mongolia. They withstand outrageous desert temperatures, but also regularly survive in snow covered mountains. A camel in the snow doesn't seem quite right, but when you are built for the conditions it's all automatic.\nTo withstand both heat and cold, camels have a woolly coat of insulating fur. Although they will shed some of it in summer months it serves to keep out heat as well as cold.\nThe camels humps actually help in regulating heat as well. With most of its fat stores in the hump, the rest of the body can cool off more easily. Naturally, the camels ability to live extended periods - sometimes months- without a drink of water is its most fascinating adaption. The hump is not an ideal source of hydration, as it takes energy for the body to get to the fat reserves and process them, but it is still the only animal with such capabilities.\nWhen you consider that a horse (even the desert barb and Arabian breeds) can't survive more than 4 or 5 days without water, the camels abilities are positively amazing.\nCamels even have specially shaped blood cells to keep blood circulating even when it thickens from dehydration. The camels body wastes no water. The camels urine is like a thick maple syrup, and its droppings are so dry they can be used within minutes of passing to start a campfire! Amazing Camel Facts.\nCamel personality\nnoble Bactrian camel noble Dromedary camel\ncamel has a Coke on the beach\nSo let's just say that camels have a bit of a reputation.\nThey grunt, swear and spit (although their \"spit\" is actually vomit) They have been seen on many a tourists vacation videos kicking, bucking, biting and even swatting innocent folks with their tail.\nThey are incredibly loud and will voice their objections with thundering groans and rolling eyes.\nThey are odorous, belching and passing gas with musical regularity. They may not be the most attractive animal that made it to the ark, though they often possess a regal expression.\nBut those who know the camel best - the Bedouin people of Africa, and the Khalka people of Mongolia - hold these creatures very dear.\nCamels are vital to these mostly nomadic peoples existence. They are considered members of the family and treated with great respect.\nSomeone who abuses their camels will be looked down upon and often chastised by the community. The camel is a very intelligent and emotional animal. They form close bonds with their human counterparts and work with a noble dignity when they are treated with respect\nThe typical domestic camel can understand hundreds of words and dozens of specific requests. They know the difference between right and left, will lift each of their feet on command, open their mouths if requested, lower their heads to be bridled, lower themselves to their knees to be mounted.\nThey are broken to a halter and saddle within a few months old, and are large enough for weight bearing by the time they turn one year old.\nMothers and calves may be separated out of necessity, but often live together in service to the same human family for life.\nCamels usually have a vacation every year of 2 to 4 months, and most camels are retired from service before they turn 25.

Sea lions, seals, and walruses are in a scientific group of mammals called pinnipeds, which means \"wing foot\" or \"feather foot.\" You could probably pick out a walrus if you saw one, but how do you tell sea lions and seals apart? Sea lions and seals are marine mammals, spending a good part of each day in the ocean to find their food. They all have flippers at the end of their limbs to help them swim. Like all marine mammals, they have a thick layer of blubber to keep them warm in the chilly ocean. And they all like to eat fish\u2014lots of fish!\nSo what do you look at to tell \u201cwho\u2019s who?\u201d Look at their ears. If you see a small earflap on each side of its head, you are looking at a sea lion. Seals just have a tiny opening for their ears. The sea lion\u2019s earflaps are turned with the opening downward so water does not enter the ears. Sea lions are also able to rotate their hind flippers forward to help them scoot along beaches and rocky shorelines. Seals cannot do this and must wriggle, hunch, roll, or slide to get around out of the water.\nThere are six different species of sea lions. Here\u2019s a brief overview on each:\nAdult male Steller's sea lion, Inian Islands, Alaska\nSteller\u2019s or northern sea lion: This is the largest of the sea lions, with the adult male generally three times as large as the adult females and having a thick, hairy neck like a lion\u2019s mane. Colors range from a light buff to a reddish brown. The Steller\u2019s sea lion ranges from the Central California coast north to the Aleutian Islands and along the coast of eastern Russia south to South Korea as well as Japan.\nCalifornia sea lion, La Jolla Cove\nCalifornia sea lion: If you\u2019ve ever seen a \u201cseal\u201d show, you most likely were watching these sea lions in action. They are found on the coasts of Japan and Korea, western North America from southern Canada to mid-Mexico, and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Why are California sea lions often seen in shows at zoos and marine parks? They are intelligent, and they can learn to demonstrate many of their natural behaviors on cue. Clever California sea lions have delighted people with their abilities for decades.\nGal\u00e1pagos sea lions\nGal\u00e1pagos sea lion: A bit smaller than their closest relative, the California sea lion, these sea lions live in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, with some closer to the coast of Ecuador.\nSouthern sea lion, Falkland Islands\nSouthern or South American sea lion: A shorter and wider muzzle distinguishes this sea lion from the others. It is dark brown with a dark yellow or pale gold belly. The southern sea lion is found along the western and lower eastern coasts of South America and the Falkland Islands.\nAustralian sea lion, Kangaroo Island\nAustralian sea lion: Adult male Australian sea lions have a white to yellowish mane against a very dark brown body. The sea lion ranges along the western and southern coast of Australia.\nNew Zealand or Hooker's sea lion, also known as whakahao in Maori\nHooker\u2019s, New Zealand, or Auckland sea lion: Sporting a black or very dark brown coat, the Hooker\u2019s sea lion is slightly smaller than its neighbor, the Australian sea lion. It is found along New Zealand\u2019s coastline and has the smallest range of any sea lion. The New Zealand sea lion is classified as endangered."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "10 Facts About Sea Lions - PADI Blog", "url": "https://blog.padi.com/7-facts-about-sea-lions/", "text": "Sea lions are some of the most adorable creatures that you\u2019ll find in the sea. In fact, their name may be a bit of a misnomer; sea puppy might be a better fit. Of course, this is purely an opinion. If you\u2019re looking for some solid facts to answer questions such as \u2018what is the difference between a seal and a sea lion\u2018 and \u2018what do sea lions eat\u2018, then here are ten of them.\n1. They are mammals\nThat makes sense, considering the lion part of the name. They give birth to live pups, and the females produce milk to nurse their young \u2013 just like puppies!\n2. There are many sea lion species\nThere are actually seven different species even though they often seem to be bundled into the same category. Six species can be seen today, but one is sadly now extinct. They all belong to a group of animals called pinnipeds along with seals and walruses.\n3. The Northern Atlantic Ocean is off-limits\nWhere do sea lions live? Well, pretty much throughout the world, from Mexico to Australia \u2013 except for the Northern Atlantic Ocean. This is strange since its temperatures are certainly compatible with where these marine mammals typically live, and there\u2019s plenty of food there. Scientists have no idea why they refuse to live in this area.\n4. Sea lions vs. seals\nWhile both species belong to the pinniped order of marine mammals, the most noticeable difference is that seals can\u2019t walk on land; instead, they bounce along \u2013 known as galumphing. Sea lions, however, can walk \u2014 even run \u2014 on all four flippers. They also have external ear flaps, which \u2018true seals\u2019 don\u2019t have.\n5. Sea lions are skillful hunters\nThese carnivores enjoy a varied seafood diet of small prey such as herring, anchovies, crabs, and squid. Sea lions spearfish using 34-38 sharp teeth, and sift through reefs using their whiskers. They swallow their meals whole, and can eat up to 40 pounds a day!\n6. The bigger, the better\nA male sea lion grows to be pretty big \u2013 much larger than females. The females look for the largest males to mate with, so in this case, yes, bigger is better.\n7. Sea lions are very social\nThese playful creatures communicate in a variety of ways, although scientists are still somewhat baffled as to what their sounds mean. They travel in large colonies, which have subgroups. Some individuals will even move from subgroup to subgroup during their lifetimes \u2013 so in a way, they\u2019re kind of like cliques.\n8. They can have age-related health issues\nWhen they grow older, they become prone to pneumonia, epilepsy, and cancer.\n9. Sea lions are expert freedivers\nLike us humans, these freediving marine mammals need oxygen to survive. Their nostrils stay closed until they need to breathe in, making it easier for them to swim underwater. Some species can dive up to an incredible 300 meters (984 feet), and hold their breath for up to 20 minutes!\n10. They are endangered\nThis one is probably our fault; humans hunted sea lions for many years until they were on the brink of extinction. International laws now prohibit the hunting of them in an effort to protect and save them.\nIf these sea lion facts have left you dreaming of your own underwater encounter, then learn more about booking a trip to dive with the sea puppy (okay, fine \u2013 the sea lion) at PADI Travel."}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Sea lion - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion", "text": "Subfamily of aquatic mammals\nThis article is about the aquatic mammal. For other uses, see Sea lion (disambiguation)\nSea lions are pinnipeds characterized by external ear flaps, long foreflippers, the ability to walk on all fours, short, thick hair, and a big chest and belly. Together with the fur seals, they make up the family Otariidae, eared seals. The sea lions have six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea lion) in five genera. Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean. They have an average lifespan of 20\u201330 years. A male California sea lion weighs on average about 300 kg (660 lb) and is about 2.4 m (8 ft) long, while the female sea lion weighs 100 kg (220 lb) and is 1.8 m (6 ft) long. The largest sea lion is Steller's sea lion, which can weigh 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) and grow to a length of 3.0 m (10 ft). Sea lions consume large quantities of food at a time and are known to eat about 5\u20138% of their body weight (about 6.8\u201315.9 kg (15\u201335 lb)) at a single feeding. Sea lions can move around 16 knots (30 km/h; 18 mph) in water and at their fastest they can reach a speed of about 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph). Three species, the Australian sea lion, the Gal\u00e1pagos sea lion and the New Zealand sea lion, are listed as endangered.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nSea lions are related to walruses and seals. Together with the fur seals, they constitute the family Otariidae, collectively known as eared seals. Until recently, sea lions were grouped under a single subfamily called Otariinae, whereas fur seals were grouped in the subfamily Arcocephalinae. This division was based on the most prominent common feature shared by the fur seals and absent in the sea lions, namely the dense underfur characteristic of the former. Recent genetic evidence, suggests Callorhinus, the genus of the northern fur seal, is more closely related to some sea lion species than to the other fur seal genus, Arctocephalus. Therefore, the fur seal/sea lion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies.\nNonetheless, all fur seals have certain features in common: the fur, generally smaller sizes, farther and longer foraging trips, smaller and more abundant prey items, and greater sexual dimorphism. All sea lions have certain features in common, in particular their coarse, short fur, greater bulk, and larger prey than fur seals. For these reasons, the distinction remains useful. The family Otariidae (Order Carnivora) contains the 15 extant species of fur seals and sea lions. Traditional classification of the family into the subfamilies Arctocephalinae (fur seals) and Otariinae (sea lions) is not supported, with the fur seal Callorhinus ursinus having a basal relationship relative to the rest of the family. This is consistent with the fossil record which suggests that this genus diverged from the line leading to the remaining fur seals and sea lions about 6 million years ago (mya). Similar genetic divergences between the sea lion clades as well as between the major Arctocephalus fur seal clades, suggest that these groups underwent periods of rapid radiation at about the time they diverged from each other. The phylogenetic relationships within the family and the genetic distances among some taxa highlight inconsistencies in the current taxonomic classification of the family.\nArctocephalus is characterized by ancestral character states such as dense underfur and the presence of double rooted cheek teeth and is thus thought to represent the most \"primitive\" line. It was from this basal line that both the sea lions and the remaining fur seal genus, Callorhinus, are thought to have diverged. The fossil record from the western coast of North America presents evidence for the divergence of Callorhinus about 6 mya, whereas fossils in both California and Japan suggest that sea lions did not diverge until years later.\nPhysiology [ edit ]\nDiving adaptations [ edit ]\nSea lion heart.\nThere are many components that makeup sea lion physiology and these processes control aspects of their behavior. Physiology dictates thermoregulation, osmoregulation, reproduction, metabolic rate, and many other aspects of sea lion ecology including but not limited to their ability to dive to great depths. The sea lions' bodies control heart rate, gas exchange, digestion rate, and blood flow to allow individuals to dive for a long period of time and prevent side effects of high pressure at depth.\nThe high pressures associated with deep dives cause gases such as nitrogen to build up in tissues which are then released upon surfacing, possibly causing death. One of the ways sea lions deal with the extreme pressures is by limiting the amount of gas exchange that occurs when diving. The sea lion allows the alveoli to be compressed by the increasing water pressure thus forcing the surface air into cartilage lined airway just before the gas exchange surface. This process prevents any further oxygen exchange to the blood for muscles, requiring all muscles to be loaded with enough oxygen to last the duration of the dive. However, this shunt reduces the amount of compressed gases from entering tissues therefore reducing the risk of decompression sickness. The collapse of alveoli does not allow for any oxygen storage in the lungs, however. This means that sea lions must mitigate oxygen use in order to extend their dives. Oxygen availability is prolonged by the physiological control of heart rate in sea lions. By reducing heart rate to well below surface rates, oxygen is saved by reducing gas exchange as well as reducing the energy required for a high heart rate. Bradycardia is a control mechanism to allow a switch from pulmonary oxygen to oxygen stored in the muscles which is needed when the sea lions are diving to depth. Another way sea lions mitigate the oxygen obtained at the surface in dives is to reduce digestion rate. Digestion requires metabolic activity and therefore energy and oxygen are consumed during this process; however, sea lions can limit digestion rate and decrease it by at least 54%. This reduction in digestion results in a proportional reduction in oxygen use in the stomach and therefore a correlated oxygen supply for diving. Digestion rate in these sea lions increases back to normal rates immediately upon resurfacing. Oxygen depletion limits dive duration, but carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) build-up also plays a role in the dive capabilities of many marine mammals. After a sea lion returns from a long dive, CO 2 is not expired as fast as oxygen is replenished in the blood, due to the unloading complications with CO 2 . However, having more than normal levels of CO 2 in the blood does not seem to adversely affect dive behavior. Compared to terrestrial mammals, sea lions have a higher tolerance to storing CO 2 which is what normally tells mammals that they need to breathe. This ability to ignore a response to CO 2 is likely brought on by increased carotid bodies which are sensors for oxygen levels that let the animal know its available oxygen supply. Yet, the sea lions cannot avoid the effects of gradual CO 2 build-up which eventually causes the sea lions to spend more time at the surface after multiple repeated dives to allow for enough built up CO 2 to be expired.\nParasites and diseases [ edit ]\nBehavioural and environmental correlates of Philophthalmus zalophi, a foot parasite. And the infection has impacted the survival of juvenile Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki). This infection leads to diseases that are connected to global warming. The number of infectious stages of different parasites species has a strong correlation with temperature change, therefore it is essential to consider the correlation between the increasing number of parasitic infections and climate changes. To test this proposed theory researchers used Galapagos sea lions because they are endemic to the Galapagos islands. The Galapagos Islands goes through seasonal changes in sea surface temperatures, which consist of high temperatures from the beginning of January through the month of May and lower temperatures throughout the rest of the year. Parasites surfaced in large numbers when the sea temperature was at its highest. Furthermore, data was collected by capturing sea lions in order to measure and determine their growth rates. Their growth rates were noted along with the citings of parasites which were found under the eyelid. The shocking results were that sea lions are affected the parasites from the early ages of 3 weeks old up until the age of 4 to 8 months. The parasites found in the eye fluke did serious damage to the eye. From the data collected, 21 of the 91 survived; with a total of 70 deaths in just a span of two years. The parasites are attacking the pups at such young ages; thus causing the pups to not reach the age of reproduction. The death rates of the pups is surpassing the fertility rate by far. Since most pups are unable to reach the age of reproduction, the population is not growing fast enough to keep the species out of endangerment. The pups who do survive must pass their strong genes down to make sure their young survive and the generation that follows. Other parasites, like Anisakis and heartworm can also infect sea lions.\nAlong with Galapagos islands, sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) being affected are the Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea). The same method was used for the sea pups on the galapagos island, but in addition, the researchers in Australia took blood samples. The pups in Australia were being affected by hookworms, but they were also coming out in large numbers with warmer temperatures. New Zealand sea lion pups (Phocarctos hookeri) were also affected in really early ages by hookworms (Uncinaria). The difference is that in New Zealand researchers took the necessary steps and began treatment. The treatment seemed to be effective on the pups who have taken it. They found no traces of this infection afterwards. However, the percentage of pups who do have it is still relatively high at about 75%. Those pups who were treated had much better growth rates than those who did not. Overall parasites and hookworms are killing off enough pups to place them in endangerment. Parasites affect sea pups in various areas of the world. Reproductive success reduces immensely, survival methods, changes in health and growth have also been affected.\nSimilarly, climate change has resulted in increased toxic algae blooms in the oceans. These toxins are ingested by sardines and other fish which are then eaten by the sea lions, causing neurological damage and diseases such as epilepsy.\nGene expressions and diet [ edit ]\nGene expressions are being used more often to detect the physiological responses to nutrition, as well as other stressors. In a study done with four Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), three of the four sea lions underwent a 70-day trial which consisted of unrestricted food intake, acute nutritional stress, and chronic nutritional stress. Results showed that individuals under nutritional stress down-regulated some cellular processes within their immune response and oxidative stress. Nutritional stress was considered the most proximate cause of population decline in this species. In New Zealand sea lions, north-to south gradients driven by temperature differences were shown to be key factors in the prey mix.\nGeographic variation [ edit ]\nGeographic variation for sea lions have been determined by the observations of skulls of several Otariidae species; a general change in size corresponds with a change in latitude and primary productivity. Skulls of Australian sea lions from Western Australia were generally smaller in length whereas the largest skulls are from cool temperate localities. Otariidae are in the process of species divergence, much of which may be driven by local factors, particularly latitude and resources. Populations of a given species tend to be smaller in the tropics, increase in size with increasing latitude, and reach a maximum in sub-polar regions. In a cool climate and cold waters there should be a selective advantage in the relative reduction of body surface area resulting from increased size, since the metabolic rate is related more closely to body surface area than to body weight.\nBreeding and population [ edit ]\nBreeding methods and habits [ edit ]\nTwo sea lions on the beach of Otago Peninsula, New Zealand\nSea lions, with three groups of pinnipeds, have multiple breeding methods and habits over their families but they remain relatively universal. Otariids, or eared sea lions, raise their young, mate, and rest in more earthly land or ice habitats. Their abundance and haul-out behavior have a direct effect on their on land breeding activity. Their seasonal abundance trend correlates with their breeding period between the austral summer of January to March. Their rookeries populate with newborn pups as well as male and female otariids that remain to defend their territories. At the end of the breeding period males disseminate for food and rest while females remain for nurturing. Other points in the year consist of a mix of ages and genders in the rookeries with haul-out patterns varying monthly.\nSteller sea lions, living an average of 15 to 20 years, begin their breeding season when adult males establish territories along the rookeries in early May. Male sea lions reach sexual maturity from ages 5 to 7 and don't become territorial until around 9 to 13 years of age. The females arrive in late May bringing in an increase of territorial defense through fighting and boundary displays. After a week births consist most usually of one pup with a perinatal period of 3 to 13 days.\nSteller sea lions have exhibited multiple competitive strategies for reproductive success. Sea lion mating is often polygamous as males usually mate with different females to increase fitness and success, leaving some males to not find a mate at all. Polygamous males rarely provide parental care towards the pup. Strategies used to monopolize females include the resource-defense polygyny, or occupying important female resources. This involves occupying and defending a territory with resources or features attractive to females during sexually receptive periods. Some of these factors may include pupping habitat and access to water. Other techniques include potentially limiting access of other males to females.\nPopulation [ edit ]\nOtaria flavescens (South American sea lion) lives along the Chilean coast with a population estimate of 165,000. According to the most recent surveys in northern and southern Chile the sealing period of the middle twentieth century that left a significant decline in sea lion population is recovering. The recovery is associated with less hunting, otariids rapid population growth, legislation on nature reserves, and new food resources. Haul-out patterns change the abundance of sea lions at particular times of the day, month, and year. Patterns in migration relate to temperature, solar radiation, and prey and water resources. Studies of South American sea lions and other otariids document maximum population on land during early afternoon, potentially due to haul-out during high air temperatures. Adult and subadult males do not show clear annual patterns, maximum abundance being found from October to January. Females and their pups hauled-out during austral winter months of June to September.\nInteractions with humans [ edit ]\nSouth American sea lions have been greatly impacted by human exploitation. During the late Holocene period to the middle of the twentieth century, hunter-gatherers along the Beagle Channel and northern Patagonia had greatly reduced the number of sea lions due to their hunting of the species and exploitation of the species\u2019 environment. Although sealing has been put to a halt in many countries, such as Uruguay, the sea lion population continues to decline because of the drastic effects humans have on their ecosystems. As a result, South American sea lions have been foraging at higher tropical latitudes than they did prior to human exploitation. Fishermen play a key role in the endangerment of sea lions. Sea lions rely on fish, like pollock, as a food source and have to compete with fishermen for it. When fishermen are successful at their job, they greatly reduce the sea lion's food source, which in turn endangers the species. Also, human presence and human recreational activities can cause sea lions to engage in violent and aggressive actions. When humans come closer than 15 meters of a sea lion, the sea lions' vigilance increases because of the disturbance of humans. These disturbances can potentially cause sea lions to have psychological stress responses that cause the sea lions to retreat, sometimes even abandon their locations, and decreases the amount of time sea lions spend hauling out.\nNew Zealand sea lions were also exploited from hunting and sealing, and as a result were extirpated from New Zealand's mainland for over 150 years, with their population being restricted to the subantarctic. In 1993, a female New Zealand sea lion gave birth on the mainland for the first time, and since then, they have slowly been recolonizing. These sea lions are the only pinnipeds that regularly move up to 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) inland into forests. As consequence, they have been hit by cars on roads, deliberately killed, and been disturbed by dogs. Females need to move inland as a way to protect their pups, so roads, fences, residential areas, and private lands can inhibit their dispersal and breeding success. They have also adapted to commercial pine forests, and have given birth or nursed pups in residents' backyards and on golf courses. As one of the world's rarest sea lions, and an endangered and endemic species, efforts are being made to facilitate coexistence between them and humans.\nSea lion attacks on humans are rare, but when humans come within approximately 2.5 meters (8 ft), it can be very unsafe. In a highly unusual attack in 2007 in Western Australia, a sea lion leapt from the water and seriously mauled a 13-year-old girl surfing behind a speedboat. The sea lion appeared to be preparing for a second attack when the girl was rescued. An Australian marine biologist suggested that the sea lion may have viewed the girl \"like a rag doll toy\" to be played with. In San Francisco, where an increasingly large population of California sea lions crowds docks along San Francisco Bay, incidents have been reported in recent years of swimmers' being bitten on the legs by large, aggressive males, possibly as territorial acts. In April 2015, a sea lion attacked a 62-year-old man who was boating with his wife in San Diego. The attack left the man with a punctured bone. In May 2017, a sea lion grabbed and pulled a girl into the water by her dress before retreating. The child was sitting on a pier side in British Columbia while tourists were illegally feeding the sea lions when the incident took place. She was pulled out of the water with minor injuries and received antibiotic prophylactic treatment for seal finger infection from the superficial bite injury.\nThere have also been documented events of sea lions assisting humans. One such notable instance of this is when Kevin Hines jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in a suicide attempt and was helped to stay afloat by a sea lion until he was rescued by the Coast Guard.\nSea lions have also been a focus of tourism in Australia and New Zealand. One of the main sites to view sea lions is in the Carnac Island Nature Reserve near Perth in Western Australia. This tourist site receives over 100,000 visitors, many of whom are recreational boaters and tourists, who can watch the male sea lions haul out on to the shore. They have sometimes been called \"the unofficial welcoming committee of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\".\nGallery [ edit ]\nA gathering of more than 40 sea lions off the coast of California A military sea lion on board a U.S. Navy ship A sea lion at the Memphis Zoo A sea lion pup sleeping at Pantai Inn A sea lion in Malibu, California Sea Lion at Monterey Breakwater A sea lion sleeps in the Ballestas Islands, Peru A group of sea lions rest in the Ballestas Islands, Peru\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]\nFurther reading [ edit ]"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Gazelle Facts - Animals of the World - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/gazelle-facts-animals-of-the-world.html", "text": "4. Physical Description\nThe name gazelle is borrowed from the Arabic word \u201cgazal\u201d. It was often used in love poems in ancient Persia. Apart from being a symbol of love, the gazelle was also associated with female beauty in Arabic literature. This was in relation to its feature of being a graceful animal. The theme of love was also borrowed from the Hebrew poetic book found in the Christian Bible known as the \u201cSong of Songs\u201d (8:14).\nThe gazelle is grouped in the same family as cattle, goats and sheep. It resembles the deer and antelope. There are about 19 species of gazelles that exist in the world. Small gazelles include the Thomson\u2019s gazelles and the Speke\u2019s gazelle. These gazelles weigh 12-75 kg and are between 51 and 109 cm tall. On the other hand, the largest gazelle is the Dama gazelle. It weighs 40-75 kg and has a height of 137-168 cm. Gazelles are light and swift which allows them to run away from their predators. Gazelles have small heads, large eyes and ears, and narrow muzzles. They also have a strong sense of hearing, sight, and smell which they use to make up for their vulnerability in their wild habitats.\nOther species of gazelles include Grant\u2019s gazelle, Mhorr gazelle, Edmi gazelle, Cuvier\u2019s gazelle, Goitered gazelle, Chinkara, Dorcas gazelle, and Soemmerring\u2019s gazelle. The most popular species of the gazelle is the Thomson\u2019s gazelle which is mainly found in African savannas. Gazelles are usually tan or reddish brown in color and they have distinctly curved and ringed horns. The male gazelles have long horns that are marked by 20 rings and curved backwards. The female gazelles may either have small and short horns or no horns at all. Amongst all species of gazelles, the Edmi gazelle horns grow the longest and can reach 35.5 cm long. The male gazelles are referred to as \u201cbucks\u201d while the female gazelles are known as \u201cdoes.\u201d\n3. Diet\nGazelles are herbivores who only feed on vegetation. They feed on grass, shoots, and leaves. Whenever they want to reach leaves from high branches, gazelles have the ability to stand on their back legs. Young gazelles need a high amount of water for their survival. However, once they are able to fend for themselves, they adapt to using little water or no water at all. In fact, some gazelles can live their life without drinking water. The water used by their bodies is extracted from the plants they feed on. Since it is difficult for predators to attack gazelles if they are in herds, the animals will often feed on grassland in herds. Feeding near zebras and wildebeests is also common.\n2. Habitat and Range\nGazelles often live in hot and dry savannas and deserts which can be found in places like Africa and Asia. They can also be found in southwest and central Asia as well as in India. The animals prefer to inhabit shrubs and grasslands. To survive the hot weather, gazelles shrink their heart and liver which allows them to stay hydrated. Doing so enables them to lose less water from their bodies so they can retain most of it. Male gazelles protect their territories by either laying droppings in their areas of interest or spraying scent on the tall grass surrounding their habitat. If their territories are challenged, male gazelles lock horns with their opponent in defence. The winner takes the possession of the territory. Farming, loss of habitat, and hunting threatens gazelles' existence.\n1. Behavior\nGazelles are social animals that live in groups composed of as many as 700 members. Sometimes, females and males live in separate groups. For instance, the female Thomson's gazelles live in groups of 10-30 with their young. As soon as the young become of age, the males join a group called a bachelor's herd. Gazelles have a gestation period of 6 months, after which they give birth to one or two fawns. They give birth twice per year and their breeding season occurs during the rainy season of the year which ensures the calves have plenty of water to drink. Due to the high amount of gazelles dying from predators, giving birth twice per year is essential to the animals. It also brings balance to the ecosystem because a higher number of herbivores compared to carnivores is needed. Gazelles have a life span of 10-15 years.\nIf looming danger is present, gazelles have an interesting way of warning each other. When they sense the presence of another animal, they will either flick their tail or stomp their feet. The rest of the herd will understand the signal and take cover. For large animals such as cheetahs and lions, gazelles are considered prey. Gazelles can run at very high speeds which can reach 100km/hr. They have adopted a leaping style known as \"stotting\" which involves springing into the air with all four feet. At this high speed, a gazelle can even outrun a cheetah. Due to its ability to run at such a high speed, predators will often approach a gazelle stealthily and catch it by surprise. Young gazelles hide in tall grass which helps to protect them from danger."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Babirusa images!\n\u201cBabirusas can stand up on their back hooves to reach leaves on low branches in trees\u201d\nBabirusas are also called deer-pigs because they look like swine (pigs) and have tusks similar to the antlers of a deer. These animals are omnivores eating a diet of plants, fruits, berries, insects, and carrion. They live on the Sulawesi, Sula, Buru and Togian islands in Indonesia. They can live up to ten years old in the wild.\n5 Incredible Babirusa Facts!\nThere are four species of babirusa\nThe tusks on the upper snout of this animal are actually canine teeth that have grown up and broken through the skin\nThese swine live in swamps and in rainforests near rivers\nThese mammals communicate with one another by grunting, growling, and chattering their teeth\nScientists are not certain regarding the true purpose of a male babirusa\u2019s tusks\nBabirusa Scientific Name\nBabyrousa celebensis is the scientific name for the babirusa. This type of babirusa is also known as the North Sulawesi babirusa. The Malaysian word babirusa translates to deer-pig. They have the appearance of a swine as well as antlers like a deer. They belong to the Suidae family and the Mammalia class.\nThere are four species of babirusa. Besides the North Sulawesi babirusa there are the:\nBuru babirusa\nBola batu babirusa\nTogian babirusa\nBabirusa Appearance & Behavior\nBabirusas have brown or grayish skin with a sparse amount of hair on their body. Their long, rounded body has been compared to the shape of a torpedo! Plus, they have slender legs similar to those of a deer. These mammals can grow to a height of two to three feet and can be three to three and a half feet long. Furthermore, they can weigh from 132 to 220 pounds. A three-foot-tall babirusa is equal in height to two and a half bowling pins stacked on top of each other. A 220-pound babirusa is equal in weight to two-thirds of an adult panda bear. Out of all the species of babirusa, the North Sulawesi babirusa is the heaviest at 220 pounds.\nThe most well-known feature of this mammal is its tusks. It has two tusks on the lower half of its snout and two on the upper half. Though they are called tusks, they are actually canine teeth. On its upper snout, the babirusa\u2019s canine teeth grow, break through the skin and curve upward and back toward the babirusa\u2019s eyes. In fact, these curving teeth (tusks) can grow so long, they can actually penetrate the skull of this animal eventually causing death.\nTheir lower canine teeth (tusks) grow sideways and upward out of the babirusa\u2019s mouth. Only male Sulawesi babirusas have full-sized tusks on the upper half of their snout. Females may have very small, short upper tusks or none at all. However, both males and females have tusks on the lower half of their snout.\nBabirusas have four-pointed, strong hooves that they use to dig. They dig up insects, insect larvae, plants, and roots. Also, when two males are fighting in competition for a female, the males use their hooves to strike each other. They rear up on their back feet, smashing into each other, kicking their hooves. It is a fierce and noisy competition!\nHumans and feral, or wild, dogs are the only predators of adults. These mammals can run at speeds of up to 30mph. So, when they encounter a human or a feral dog, these shy mammals run and hide in a swampy area or rainforest. Their dark skin allows them to blend in with their muddy, swamp habitat.\nMost males are solitary. Alternatively, females are social creatures living in groups of 80 or more babirusas. This large group includes only females and young babirusas.\nThe Babirusa\u2019s name means pig deer after their unusual appearance! Craig Russell/Shutterstock.com\nBabirusa Habitat\nThey live on islands in Indonesia including Togian, Sula, Buru, and Sulawesi. Wild babirusas don\u2019t live anywhere else in the world except on these islands. These mammals live in a moist, tropical climate in swamps and in rainforests, near rivers. They take shelter in the underbrush and in canebrakes.\nThese swine roll around in the mud in order to cool themselves in this humid climate. This is also an effective way to get rid of any parasites on their skin. Another interesting behavior of these swine is called plowing. A male babirusa lowers itself to its knees and pushes its nose through the sandy ground. The babirusa has its mouth open and takes in the sand while releasing foaming saliva. This is strange behavior that scientists haven\u2019t fully figured out. But they think plowing may be a way for a babirusa to mark its territory with its scent.\nIn addition, these animals are great swimmers so they tend to live near rivers. They\u2019ve been known to swim a long distance from one island to another.\nBabirusa Predators and Threats\nThese animals are omnivores. Oftentimes, they use their hooves to dig in the ground in search of insects or larvae. They can stand on their back hooves supporting their body in order to eat leaves off the lower branches of a tree.\nWhat does a babirusa eat?\nThese animals eat a diet of plants, leaves, fruit, berries, insects, tree bark, and sometimes carrion. They eat fruit and berries off the ground. They dig for insects and pull bark off trees. If they find a dead animal (carrion) on the ground, they may eat it. It all depends on what food source is most plentiful in their swampy habitat at the time.\nWhat eats a babirusa?\nThe animal\u2019s only predators are humans and sometimes feral dogs. Some Indonesians hunt for babirusas in order to eat them.\nThe conservation status of the animal is Vulnerable with a decreasing population. The future of this mammal is at risk due to habitat loss as a result of logging activity. Poaching is another threat to these animals despite the existence of laws protecting them. Some locals even capture young babirusas and tame them to keep them as pets!\nBabirusa Reproduction and Life Cycle\nThe mating season of the deer-pig goes from January to August. Males fight one another in competition for females. It would seem logical that the males would use their upper and lower tusks as weapons when fighting for a female. But, in reality, their tusks are easily cracked and broken. In fact, they will purposely move their heads to the side while they are fighting so their tusks won\u2019t smack together. So, males use their pointed hooves and the overall strength of their bodies to fight in order to determine the strongest male. The most powerful male mates with several females.\nSome scientists believe that the curved tusks on the upper part of the snout serve to protect the animal\u2019s eyes during this competition for females.\nThe gestation period is 155 to 158 days. A wild boar, another member of the Suidae family, has a shorter gestation period of 115 days. Females give live birth to one to two babies in a litter. Each newborn baby, aka a piglet, weighs from ten to 15 pounds. Some babies as young as three to ten days old start to eat solid foods. However, they will likely continue to nurse until they are completely weaned at six to eight months of age. Once they are weaned, they become independent.\nThough these animals can live up to ten years in the wild, they have been known to live up to 24 years in captivity.\nA babirusa\u2019s tusks continue to grow throughout its life. This is similar to the way a person\u2019s fingernails grow throughout life. Sometimes the tusks on a male babirusa\u2019s upper snout continue to grow and curve until one or both break through the top of the animal\u2019s skull! This can eventually lead to death depending on how deeply the tusk goes into the animal\u2019s skull.\nBabirusa Population\nAccording to the IUCN Redlist, the population of the Sulawesi babirusa is 9,999 mature individuals. Their population is decreasing, and they are listed with a conservation status of Vulnerable.\nThe population of the Togian Islands babirusa includes 1,000 mature individuals. They have a decreasing population as well and are listed as Endangered.\nThe population of the hairy babirusa (scientific name Babyrousa babyrussa) is unknown. This species of babirusa is listed as Vulnerable with a decreasing population.\nView all 184 animals that start with B"}

Seals have small flippers, wriggle on their bellies on land, and lack visible ear flaps.\nHave you ever wondered about the main differences between seals and their \"second cousins,\" the sea lions?\nBoth seals and sea lions, together with the walrus, are pinnipeds, which means \"fin footed\" in Latin.\nBut seals' furry, generally stubby front feet \u2014 thinly webbed flippers, actually, with a claw on each small toe \u2014 seem petite in comparison to the mostly skin-covered, elongated fore flippers that sea lions possess.\nSecondly, sea lions have small flaps for outer ears. The \"earless\" or \"true\" seals lack external ears altogether. You have to get very close to see the tiny holes on the sides of a seal\u2019s sleek head.\nThird, sea lions are noisy. Seals are quieter, vocalizing via soft grunts.\nFourth, while both species spend time both in and out of the water, seals are better adapted to live in the water than on land. Though their bodies can appear chubby, seals are generally smaller and more aquadynamic than sea lions. At the same time, their hind flippers angle backward and don't rotate. This makes them fast in the water but basic belly crawlers on terra firma.\nSea lions, on the other hand, are able to \"walk\" on land by rotating their hind flippers forward and underneath their big bodies. This is why they are more likely to be employed in aquaria and marine shows.\nFinally, seals are less social than their sea-lion cousins. They spend more time in the water than sea lions do and often lead solitary lives in the wild, coming ashore together only once a year to meet and mate.\nSea lions congregate in gregarious groups called herds or rafts that can reach upwards of 1,500 individuals. It's common for scores of them to haul out together and loll about in the sand, comprising an amorphous pile in the noonday sun."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Donkey images!\nWhile donkeys are thought to be stubborn, they are actually highly intelligent creatures that can form tight bonds with humans.\nDonkeys are members of the horse family, although donkeys and horses represent two very different species. After domestication in Egypt and North Africa, where they were used for meat and milk, they evolved to become working beasts used to carry people or packages. They are slower than horses but are more surefooted. Historians believe that the domestication of donkeys increased the mobility of pastor cultures in the ancient world. Equipped with a social and calming nature, donkeys get along well with other domesticated mammals and can also be excellent companions for people with physical or mental disabilities.\n5 Donkey Facts\nDonkeys are often referred to as burros. In Spanish, the word burrito means \u2018little donkey\u2019, which also refers to the Mexican food that resembles the packs that donkeys carry.\nDonkeys graze throughout the day and like a diet low in protein and high in fiber.\nFemale donkeys are called jennys, males are called jacks, and castrated males are called geldings.\nDonkeys were commonly referred to as asses until about 1785 when the word slowly began falling out of use because of its pejorative context.\nStartled donkeys will freeze or move a few steps away when they are scared to assess their situation instead of running away, a characteristic which gives them their undeserved reputation for being stubborn.\nDonkey Scientific Name\nThe classification of these animals is within the family Equidae and the genus Equus \u2013 meaning horse in Latin. There are two main types of wild donkeys: Asian donkeys, whose range stretches from the Red Sea to Northern India and Tibet, resulting in several subspecies, and the African branch of the species. Among the Asian subspecies in the classification are Equus hemionus hemippus (Syrian Wild ass) and Equus hemionus khur (Indian wild ass).\nAll modern domesticated donkeys have the scientific name Equus africanus asinus and have descended from African wild asses located primarily in Northern Africa between the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert.\nDonkey Appearance and Behavior\nThese animals come in many different sizes and colors. Wild species grow to about 49 inches from hoof to shoulder and weigh about 551 lbs. Domesticated donkeys come in different sizes, depending on how they are bred. They are typically 36 inches to 48 inches from hoof to shoulder, weighing from 400 to 500 lbs. The Sicilian donkey is the smallest, reaching only 24 inches while the ass of Mallorca is about 62 inches. The Mammoth Stock, the largest domestic breed, is 56 inches from hoof to shoulder and weighs about 950 lbs.\nColor ranges for these animals range from white and gray to black. Grey is the most common color, followed by brown, black, and roan (white with a mixture of other pigmented hairs). Most usually have a dark stripe of fur down their backs from mane to tail and across their shoulders. They have short, upright manes with a tail that is more similar to that of a cow than that of a horse. They have very long ears that are dark at the tip and the base. Their large ears also help cool donkeys by using them in a fan-like manner.\nThese animals enjoy the company of other donkeys and often bond with other individuals. When their kind are not present, they will often bond with horses, mules, and other small stock. Once a human has earned their confidence, they are often willing and companionable partners. Because of their ability to form strong bonds, separating a bonded donkey pair can cause stress leading to hyperlipidemia, a blood condition that can result in a heart attack or stroke.\nAlthough they have a reputation for stubbornness, this trait is a self-preservation characteristic, which is why it is difficult to force a donkey into doing something that it perceives as dangerous. Their body language is also less expressive than those of horses, so they can be hard to read. A slight widening of their eyes can be misread as curiosity when it means stress or fear. A lack of movement when viewing an object that they fear is part of their reduced flight response. They will often defend themselves by biting, striking with the front hooves, or kicking with the hind legs.\nThese animals are known to be intelligent as well as cautious, friendly, playful, and eager to learn, which usually begins from the moment they\u2019re born and continues throughout their lifetimes.\nDomesticated donkeys are more territorial than horses, which is why they are sometimes used to guard herds of sheep and goats against predators, often stomping on anything that they feel is a threat. In many parts of the world where horses cannot easily survive or where there is extreme poverty, they are the primary beasts of burden and sources of transportation. They rest during the hottest part of the day and are more active in the morning and evening when they travel with the herd and eat.\nAfrican Donkey, Equus asinus, picture taken in Tanzania Nevit Dilmen / Creative Commons\nDonkey Habitat\nDomesticated donkeys are found all over the world in many different cultures, but if given their preference, they are best adapted for warm, dry areas \u2013 particularly marginal desert areas. This adaptation has provided them with hardy immune and digestive systems. Wild donkeys are usually solitary and do not form harems, with each adult establishing a home range. One jack may dominate breeding over a wide area.\nIf a domesticated donkey becomes feral and can choose its home, it will look for a warm place to live. Wild donkeys live in deserts and savannahs in northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Middle East. These animals also live in Turkey, China, and in northern areas of Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Their loud calls, also known as a bray, and be heard over three kilometers and may act as a way for donkeys to keep in touch with each other in the wild.\nDonkey Diet\nThese animals are herbivores, meaning they eat no meat. They enjoy a variety of foods, including hay, oats, grains, and grasses, but they will also eat shrubs and desert plants in certain areas. Their large lips allow them to grab plants and pull them into their mouths where they rip it apart with large front teeth and grind it before swallowing. These voracious eaters can consume as much as 6,000 lbs of food each year. Their immense appetites can become a problem if they become feral and take over the food supply from local creatures.\nDonkey Predators and Threats\nSome estimate that the world\u2019s donkey population could fall by half within the next five years to meet a rising demand for donkey hides used in traditional Chinese medicine. In 2006, the world had a donkey population of approximately 41 million. The worldwide number appears to continue to decrease even among domesticated donkeys as some poachers have raided domestic herds in some areas to satisfy the need for donkeys to create the gelatin-based traditional medicine called ejiao.\nIn the wild, donkey predators include foxes, wolves, and lions.\nDonkey Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nA female donkey, called a jenny, is pregnant for about 12 months; however, gestation varies among different species from 11 months to 14 months. Jennies usually birth a single foal, with twins being rare. Although jennies come into heat with about 10 days of giving birth, their reproductive tract is not normal at that point, and they usually don\u2019t breed again until one or two cycles have passed. Some breeds do not come into estrus (also known as heat) when they have a foal at their side. The average reproduction rate for domesticated donkeys is three foals over four years.\nFoals weigh between 19 and 30 pounds (about as heavy as a small dog) and can stand and nurse 30 minutes after birth. Jennies are very protective of their foals, who are weaned at about five months. A donkey can mate when it reaches two years of age.\nDonkeys are picky about who is in their herd, yet they don\u2019t care who they mate with and often breed with other members of the Equus family. The offspring between a jackass and a mare is called a mule, which is also valued as a working and riding animals. Less common is the offspring between a stallion and a jenny, known as a shinny. Both types of crossbreed are usually sterile. Donkeys can also breed with zebras with the offspring most often called a zonkey.\nThe average lifespan for a donkey is 27-40 years, however, they can live for much longer. The oldest donkey on record was a female domesticated donkey in the U.S. who lived to be 54.\nDonkey Population\nMore than 50 million donkeys inhabit the world with most of them domesticated, living primarily in underdeveloped countries where they work or carry cargo. Despite their great numbers, few animals within each breed are purebred.\nSeveral wild donkey species are on the edge of extinction. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), indicates that the African wild ass is critically endangered, with only 23 to 200 adults remaining. Asian wild asses (also known as Asiatic wild asses) are classified as near threatened, with a population of about 28,000. Most threats come from humans, either directly or through indirect habitat loss.\nView all 58 animals that start with D"}

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Animal Teeth Facts: Lesson for Kids - Study.com", "url": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/animal-teeth-facts-lesson-for-kids.html", "text": "Herbivores\nHerbivores are animals that only eat plants. They have molars that, like the teeth towards the back of your mouth, are strong, flat, and perfect for grinding up plant matter. Some herbivores, called grazers, eat grass and plants that are close to the ground. Other herbivores, known as browsers, pick up branches and leaves from trees. The ridges that herbivores have on their teeth help them grind up plants so that they can digest them.\nHerbivores may also have sharp incisors that help to tear plant matter so they can eat it. You're probably familiar with one herbivore that has huge incisors - elephants! Elephant tusks are actually a type of tooth; however, they mostly use them in fights or to defend against predators.\nCows and sheep are both herbivores that chew on grass. Giraffes are herbivores whose long necks help them reach the leaves of tall trees. These animals also have jaws that move up and down, as well as from side to side, allowing them to chew and grind more easily.\nCarnivores\nCarnivores are animals that eat meat. They have canines, which are sharp teeth used to tear meat. These animals have fewer molars for chewing. Canine teeth are long and pointed, such as the ones you see when a lion or tiger roars.\nCarnivores usually have four pronounced canine teeth with sharp edges. When they open and close their jaws, it is as if a pair of scissors is tearing through their prey. Unlike herbivores, carnivores' jaws only move up and down, helping their teeth to work correctly.\nOmnivores\nOmnivores eat both plants and animals, so they need a variety of teeth types for eating different foods. To get an idea of the variety, open wide and take a look at your own mouth in a mirror. Humans have canines and incisors to rip and cut food into smaller bits. Flat, ridged molars in the backs of our mouths grind food. Chimpanzees, raccoons, and bears are all omnivores."}

They are herbivorous animals that eat a variety of plants. Though these rodents are active in the daytime they stay mostly underground in tunnels. They are solitary animals. The lifespan of a gopher ranges from 1 to 3 years.\nAn Incredible Animal: Five Gopher Facts!\n\u2022 The pocket gopher can turn its fur-lined pouches inside out to remove the contents, much like a pocket\n\u2022 The gopher is able to close their lips while keeping their incisor teeth exposed; if they did not do that, they would get a lot of dirt in its mouth while digging\n\u2022 Gophers don\u2019t need to leave their tunnels even to find water. They get their water supply from the moisture in the plants they eat\n\u2022 Gophers are animals with flat teeth that help them to grind up bulbs, roots, and other parts of a plant\n\u2022 They sometimes share their tunnels with other animals\nGopher Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for this gopher is Geomys bursarius. It\u2019s in the Geomyidae family and belongs to the class Mammalia. This rodent is also known as a pocket gopher because it has fur lining the pouches inside its cheeks. It is capable of turning these pouches inside out to remove the contents. Like a pocket!\nThe origin of the word gopher is believed to have come from the French word gaufre. Gaufre means waffle which may refer to the complicated pattern of the tunnels made by pocket gofers.\nThere are many subspecies of this gopher. Some of them include the Geomys bursarius ozarkensis, the Geomys bursarius illinoensis, and the Geomys bursarius missouriensis. Subspecies of the gopher, or pocket gopher, live throughout the United States and down into Mexico.\nGopher: The Animal\u2019s Appearance and Behavior\nGophers have brownish, black fur as well as small dark eyes and tiny ears. A gopher has a slender body that it can flatten allowing it to fit into narrow tunnels. This rodent ranges from 5 to 14 inches long. A gopher that is 5 inches long is an inch or so shorter than the average pencil.\nNormally, these rodents weigh around one pound. A gopher weighing one pound is equal in weight to two hamsters you\u2019d see at a pet shop. The largest species of gopher can grow to be 2.2 pounds and live in Central America.\nThis rodent has pouches in its cheeks. It stuffs its pouches with food and carries it to different locations without losing any of it. The ability to stuff its cheeks allows this rodent to take food underground and eat it in safety.\nA gopher is an animal with a mouth and teeth designed to help it to survive in its environment. For instance, gophers have flat molars that make it easy to chew up dry, rough vegetation. Also, they are able to close their lips while keeping their incisor teeth exposed. Some scientists compare the appearance of a gopher\u2019s incisor teeth to a chisel. They use their incisors to dig through the dry, pebbly ground to make their tunnels. They push up rocks and stones as they progress. If a gopher wasn\u2019t able to close its lips, it would get a lot of dirt in its mouth while digging!\nThis animal has claws on its front paws that help it to burrow quickly so it has a place to hide from predators. Hiding underground is the main defense of this animal due to its small size.\nGophers are shy, solitary animals except during the breeding season. However, they\u2019ve been known to share their burrows and tunnels with animals other than gophers. Rabbits, lizards, and toads are all animals that may share a tunnel system with a gopher. They may not be best friends, but they manage to share the same living space!\nSERGEI BRIK/Shutterstock.com\nGopher: The Animal\u2019s Habitat\nGophers live in North America on the Great Plains ranging from Texas all the way up to the Canadian border. There are also gophers living in Central America specifically down into Mexico.\nSome species of these rodents live in deserts with extremely hot temperatures while others live near the mountains with colder temps. The main living requirement for a gopher is sandy soil that they can dig into to make a burrow. They can go underground to escape the heat or cold.\nPocket gophers make two types of tunnels. One type of tunnel is long with many twists and turns. It is near the surface of the ground and gophers move through this tunnel to find plant roots. The second type of tunnel is deeper in the ground. Gophers use these tunnels for their nests, storing food and hiding from predators.\nThey can live in wooded areas , grasslands, deserts, or meadows. These rodents don\u2019t migrate or go into hibernation. They are busy digging to extend tunnels, looking for food or breeding at various times throughout the year.\nGopher Diet: What Does The Animal Eat?\nWhat does a gopher eat? Gophers are herbivores. They like to eat the roots, bulbs, and tubers of a plant along with its leaves. Normally, a gopher finds the roots of plants growing in its tunnels and pulls the plant down to eat it. As a way to protect itself against predators, this rodent avoids leaving its tunnels to forage for plants above ground.\nGophers don\u2019t need to leave their tunnels even to find water. They get their water supply from the moisture in the plants they eat. For a complete analysis of their diet, give our \u2018What Do Gophers Eat? A Complete List of Their 8 Favorite Foods\u2019 page a read!\u201d\nGopher Predators and Threats\nSome of a gopher\u2019s predators include coyotes, snakes, weasels, hawks, and owls. When a gopher spots a predator, it heads for the protection of its burrow. These rodents can even move in a backward motion to quickly disappear into their burrow. They have sensitive tails that help to guide them back into the safety of their home.\nIf a gopher is above ground foraging for plants it can easily fall prey to a swooping owl or hawk. Plus, many snakes are able to follow gophers into their tunnels to capture them. Coyotes, bobcats, and other larger animals can overpower these rodents.\nThe official conservation status of a gopher is Least Concern. Gophers are thought of as pests in some cities where they dig tunnels under gardens and around homes. But their population remains stable.\nGopher: The Animal\u2019s Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nIn the spring season, male gophers go in search of burrows where female gophers live. Most gophers breed just once each year though some have been known to breed in the fall season as well as spring.\nGophers have more than one mate. The gestation of a female gopher ranges from 18 to 30 days. Normally, a female gopher has 5 to 6 live babies also called pups. A group of pups is called a litter. They have their litter in a nest inside their tunnel system.\nGopher pups are born blind as well as with their ears closed. They aren\u2019t able to see or hear until they are 5 weeks old. The pups nurse from their mother for several weeks and are weaned at about 40 days old. The mother gopher cares for her pups by herself. Gopher pups can stay with their mother for up to two months, then they go out to dig their own burrows.\nThe lifespan of a gopher ranges from 1 to 3 years. Though they are quick moving rodents, they have many predators that live nearby and share their environment.\nGopher Population\nThe conservation status of the pocket gopher is Least Concern and its population is holding steady. Scientists estimate an average of 4 to 5 gophers per acre of land. However, a few species of gopher are decreasing due to habitat loss. Two examples include the tropical pocket gopher and the Michoacan pocket gopher.\nThe tropical pocket gopher lives in Mexico. Its official conservation status is Endangered due to loss of habitat. Clearing of land and construction is taking away the habitat of this gopher. They are on the list of highly threatened animals in Mexico.\nThe Michoacan pocket gopher also lives in Mexico and is listed as Endangered as well. Habitat loss due to forest clearing and competition for food from other animals in the environment are two specific reasons for the population decrease of the Michoacan pocket gopher. It is now protected by the Mexican government as an animal in danger of extinction.\nView all 111 animals that start with G"}

Their distinctive appearances and highly interactive personalities have also made bichirs incredibly popular as aquarium pets.\n3 Incredible Bichir Facts!\nTaking a breath: Unlike other types of fish, bichir fish actually have lungs and are capable of breathing both in and out of the water. In fact, many will swim to the surface for a breath when the water is too muddy for their tastes.\nUnlike other types of fish, bichir fish actually have lungs and are capable of breathing both in and out of the water.

They like to eat bugs, worms, and other creatures that emerge from the mud when the sun goes down.\n: These are predatory fish that come out at night. They like to eat bugs, worms, and other creatures that emerge from the mud when the sun goes down. Walking on land: The Senegal bichir fish is known for being able to use its fins to propel itself across the land for short distances. This lets the fish move between nearby ponds or catch prey that is trying to escape from the water.\nBichir Classification and Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for these fish is Polypterus, which means \u201cmany-winged.\u201d This refers to the series of delicate fins that line the backs of all of them. The Polypteridae family belongs to the Actinopterygii class of ray-finned fishes. There is still a significant amount of debate as to how many different types exist and how they should be classified; at the moment, there are 13 recognized species.\nBichir Species\nThese fish are found in rivers and lakes across the entirety of Africa. There are currently 13 different species that are recognized by the scientific community, and many of these species have their own subspecies.\nSome of the most popular types include:\nOrnate bichir: Polypterus ornatipinnis are known for their distinctive black and yellow patterns. Although they\u2019re slightly aggressive towards other fish, their appearance makes ornate bichirs incredibly popular as aquarium pets.\nPolypterus ornatipinnis are known for their distinctive black and yellow patterns.

They have large pectoral fins that they use to propel themselves across short stretches of land. Saddled bichir: Polypterus endlicheri endlicheri is a pale-colored bichir that occasionally appears with a striking striped pattern. Saddled bichirs are the largest subspecies and can get up to 30 inches long.\nBichir Appearance\nThese are long, slender fish that are often mistaken for eels. Instead of dorsal fins, these fish have a set of delicate ray fins that grow along their spines. They propel themselves with their pectoral fins, but they also have back fins and prominent tail fins. They come in a wide variety of colors and patterns that change based on their natural habitats. Dinosaur bichirs are a dark grey color, but ornate bichir come in striking shades of black and yellow.\nThese fish are often categorized by whether their upper or lower jaw protrudes. While it\u2019s true that lower jaw bichirs often have a strong underbite, upper jaw bichirs typically have smooth jawlines that make the protrusion difficult to notice. Lower jaw bichirs are almost always larger than upper jaw bichirs.\nMost of them grow to be 11-20 inches long, and they can weigh anywhere from 5-10 pounds. Saddled bichir are one of the longest subspecies; the largest recorded fish was 30 inches long.\nchonlasub woravichan/Shutterstock.com\nBichir Distribution, Population, and Habitat\nThese fish are native to Africa and can be found in nearly every shallow freshwater river and pond on the continent. Each body of water usually only contains one species of bichir; even in aquariums, they tend to attack other bichirs of different species. Dinosaur bichirs can be found all over, but ornate bichirs are limited to the eastern parts of the continent. These fish are incredibly common and are listed as either not extinct or of least concern.\nAlthough they can live in any body of fresh water, the fish prefer muddy and silty environments. These fish are nocturnal, which means they spend most of their days sleeping at the bottom of the river. At night, they hunt for bugs, vertebrates, and other small creatures that inhabit the muddy shallows.\nBichir Predators and Prey\nThese fish are predatory creatures that will eat any animal smaller than them. Their natural prey includes shellfish, vertebrates, bugs, worms, and other fish that are small enough to fit into a bichir\u2019s mouth.\nWhen they are not hunting, they are relatively peaceful fish. They may show aggressive behavior if other predatory fish enter their territory, but they will generally leave large fish alone. These fish do not have natural predators, but they may still occasionally be caught and eaten by larger carnivores.\nBichir Reproduction and Lifespan\nThese are egg-laying fish that tend to breed once a year unless breeding is induced. They typically go through 1-2 day courting rituals in which the male chooses and attempts to woo a female. Once the couple has paired off, the female will release up to 300 eggs over a week-long period. The male fertilizes the eggs as they are released and then allows them to be scattered along the riverbed or across the aquarium floor.\nThe eggs only take 3-4 days to hatch. The fry is only 2-3 millimeters long, but they grow incredibly quickly. Most of them gain 2-3 centimeters of mass a day for the first few years of their lives. These fish in aquariums tend to live to be 15-20 years old; in the wild, their average lifespan is closer to 10 years.\nBichir in Fishing and Cooking\nThese fish is seen as an aquarium pet and are not traditionally used for cooking. Most of them sold in pet stores are bred and raised in a tank. Wild bichirs are not fished out of their habitats in quantities large enough to be recorded.\nView all 184 animals that start with B"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Quagga images!\n\u201cThe quagga became extinct over 130 years ago.\u201d\nThe quagga was a unique species of zebra that existed until the late 19th century. These magnificent creatures had a peculiar appearance when compared to other zebras. Their skins were greatly desired and were subsequently harvested for human use. The term quagga was once used collectively to refer to all zebras. At another point in time, quaggas were classified as a completely separate species. After examining their DNA, scientists have learned that the now obsolete quaggas were actually a subspecies of plains zebra. Unfortunately, these animals were extremely unexplored and undervalued while they were still around.\n5 Incredible Quagga facts!\nSome interesting facts about the quagga you might not know:\nOnly one living quagga was ever photographed. There are five photos in existence of the mare who lived in the London zoo.\nIn the past, scientists believed these animals were a separate species from zebras.\nQuaggas were primarily diurnal, though one member of the herd would always stand guard at night.\nThe first-ever animal to have its DNA analyzed was the quagga.\nQuaggas would groom each other to keep clean and rid each other of bothersome pests and parasites.\nQuagga Scientific name\n\u2020Equus quagga quagga is the scientific name for these animals. The quagga is in the Mammalia class, and it belongs to the Equidae family. There is only one species. The name \u201cquagga\u201d is an onomatopoeia, or imitation of the sound made by the animal. The call, as described by South Africans, is a \u201ckwa-ha-ha\u201d sound. The pronunciation of the word \u201cquagga\u201d uses a short \u201cA\u201d sound. The first part of the word is pronounced like \u201cflag.\u201d The correct pronunciation of quagga is \u201ckwag-uh.\u201d\nQuagga Appearance\nThe animal\u2019s appearance was fairly similar to a zebra, but it had distinguishable traits. Its appearance has also been commonly compared to a horse. It had elongated legs, and the tail had long hair on the end. The legs were incredibly strong and were made for walking long distances and running from predators. They could reach speeds of 40 miles per hour. They could also use their legs to deliver a powerful defensive kick. Like all ungulates, they had hooves. Hooves are very tough and it would be quite painful to be kicked by one.\nThe fur color was white to brown and had dark brown or black stripes. The stripe pattern on the animal was not the same as other zebra species. The stripes did not cover the entire body as they do on other zebras. They would fade out or stop somewhere below the neck or shoulders. The typical length of the animal was about 257 centimeters or 101 inches. That is almost eight-and-a-half feet long. The height was 49 to 53 inches, which is three-quarters as tall as a refrigerator. Its weight ranged between 250 and 300 kilograms (551-661 pounds). The maximum weight of the animal is as heavy as two panda bears. An adult panda weighs about 150 pounds on average.\nArticles Mentioning Quagga See all of our entertaining and insightful animal articles.\nThese animals are a subspecies of plains zebra (Equus quagga) or common zebra. There are five other subspecies closely related to the quagga. Burchell\u2019s zebra (Equus quagga burchellii), Chapman\u2019s zebra (Equus quagga chapmani), Crawshay\u2019s zebra (Equus quagga crawshayi), Grant\u2019s zebra (Equus quagga boehmi), and Maneless zebra (Equus quagga borensis) are the other subspecies of the common zebra. Additional relatives of the quagga include other species of zebras, horses, and asses (or donkeys). They are all members of the Equidae family.\nTaxidermied Quagga in the Naturhistorisches Museum of Basel.\nQuagga Behavior\nSince they were not largely studied until after their extinction date in the 19th century, there is insufficient information on the behavior of these animals. It has been noted that they were highly social animals. They lived in large herds, or harems and would migrate in groups to feed. While some animals migrate for the winter, they did not. They traveled daily rather than migrating for a specific season.\nIn the daytime, they would travel to plains or pastures with longer grass to feed on. In the middle of the day, along their trek, they would pause to drink water from nearby streams or other water sources. They would walk back to the area of shorter grass where they would spend their nights. The lower grass plains were more open and made it harder for predators to hide, giving them a better chance to sleep safely. One member of the harem would always keep an eye out for danger while the rest of the herd rested overnight.\nQuagga Habitat\nThese animals lived exclusively on the continent of Africa. They were native to South Africa precisely. They were abundant in Orange Free State and in Cape Province, especially in the Karoo region. The karoo is an expansive desert shrubland subregion of South Africa that ranges across Northern, Eastern, and Western Cape provinces. They inhabited arid and temperate climates. The animals would spend their lives in grassland and savanna habitats. These grazers were found in pastures and plains where there would be plenty of grass to feed on.\nQuagga Diet\nThese animals were migratory grazers. Their diet was not particularly fascinating because they only ate one type of food. They were not predators to any animals and only ate plants.\nWhat do quaggas eat?\nThese animals were herbivores with a simple diet. Their daily intake of food was limited to grasses. Along with water to drink, grass supplied all of the nourishment quaggas needed to survive. These picky eaters preferred to graze on tall grass as there was plenty more for the whole harem to eat than shorter grass pastures could provide. Grass is the main food source for other zebras as well. However, other species will also occasionally eat additional plant matter such as leaves and twigs, and sometimes snack on fruit.\nQuagga Predators and threats\nQuaggas, like most animals, faced threats from natural predators in the wild. The biggest threat to them, however, proved to be humans. For many years, they were hunted in large numbers for their meat and skins. They were also frequently hunted for sport. The danger of wild predators was an insignificant factor in their demise in comparison to the massive impact humans made. These animals were not highly regarded by many people. Farmers and settlers did not favor these animals because they saw them as competition to their livestock\u2019s food supply.\nRegrettably, there were no conservation efforts or protections in place for these animals while they were alive. If there were, there would possibly still be some quaggas around today. Their status on the IUCN Red List is extinct. Humans had already killed too many quaggas before anyone had the chance to realize they were one-of-a-kind. This ultimately led to their extinction in the 19th century. Over time, humans have caused hundreds of species to become extinct. The sad reality is that when there are no living cells left, there is nothing that can be done to bring them back. Humans need to work harder in both understanding and preventing the extinction of animals.\nWhat eats quaggas?\nLions are known hunters of quaggas. They would hide in the tall grass, stalking their victim. The lion would pounce and kill a quagga with its mighty jaws before feasting on it. Other big cats native to South Africa, such as cheetahs and leopards, were potential predators to quaggas as well. Essentially, any animals that prey upon zebras most likely targeted quaggas also.\nQuagga Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nQuaggas reproduced sexually. Their mating behavior was much like that of zebras. They were polygynous which means one male would mate with multiple females. The females, on the other hand, would generally only mate with a single male. There would typically be one stallion that would mate with each female in a harem. The stallion would take a filly, or young ovulating female, from the group. He would fight other stallions to claim her. This routine would take place monthly. It would take some time for the filly to conceive, perhaps an entire year. After mating, the gestation period would last for another 12 months.\nAfter carrying the baby in her womb for about a year, the mother quagga would give live birth to one baby called a foal. Foals were born precocial, meaning they could walk and see shortly after birth. They were fairly independent right away. Foals drank milk from their mothers until they weaned at around 11 months old. They would then start grazing on grass like the older members. They would usually stay with the herd for their whole lifetime.\nThe lifespan for quaggas varied depending on where they lived. Quaggas in the wild would live to about 20 years old. In captivity, where they were cared for and had more protection, they lived up to twice as long. Quaggas kept in zoos would live as long as 40 years with the added safety that could come from not being hunted and being looked after.\nQuagga Population\nSadly, the current population of quaggas is zero. Their numbers have been completely abolished and are now extinct. They no longer exist due mainly to the species being largely hunted by humans. There were many unknown facts about quaggas in the past. Once scientists realized how special these creatures were, it was too late to protect them. Wide knowledge of this special animal was long surpassed by its extinction date in the 1800s. In August of 1883, the last known quagga died in captivity. The mare was living at the Artis Magistra zoo in Amsterdam when she passed. It is believed that the last wild quagga was killed by a hunter years earlier around 1878.\nThere is currently a program that aims to revive quaggas. In 1987, The Quagga Project was started by a group of scientists and volunteers in South Africa. The group uses selective breeding of zebras to look just like quaggas. They call this \u201cbreeding back.\u201d They have successfully bred quite a few specimens that look almost identical to the original quaggas. The question posed by many is whether these animals could be true quaggas genetically. This is because the focus is solely on how they look visually. Some argue that they do not have genuine physiological traits and characteristics of an actual quagga.\nView all 6 animals that start with Q"}

The pronunciation of its name resembles that of the French, while the pronunciation for its name as leather is based on \u201cchamy\u201d or \u201cshammy.\u201d Some subspecies of this bovid are having protection under the EU\u2019s European Habitat Directive.\n5 Incredible Chamois Facts!\nThe chamois is in the goat-antelope subfamily, the same as goats and sheep.\nIt looks like an unusual goat.\nThey can jump almost 2 meters (6.5 feet) high and a minimum of 6 meters (19.5 feet) in length, and can run as fast as 50 km/h (31 mph) on uneven ground.\nChamois or shammy cloth can also refer to split sheepskin or lambskin tanned with fish oil. Alternately, it can be made of synthetic PVA.\nShammy cloth is absorbent and sponge-like, featuring a soft texture that is used for car cleaning, drying, polishing, and detailing surfaces, as well as a blending tool by artists blending charcoal.\nChamois Scientific Name\nThe chamois is an animal in the family Bovidae includes cloven-hoofed, ruminant vertebrates such as the bison, American buffalo, water buffalo, antelope, sheep, goats, muskoxen, and domestic cattle. It is further classified into the goat antelope subfamily Caprinae, which contains medium-sized bovids. Called a caprine or goat antelope, it is not a true antelope, which is classed as either cervid-like (true deer in the family Cervidae) or antilocaprid-like (even-toed ungulates in the order Artiodactyl, with their closest relatives being in the superfamily Giraffoidea).\nThere are two species in the genus Rupicapra, R. rupicapra and R. pyrenaica. Its synonym is the former scientific name Capra rupicapra. The type species R. rupicapra contains 7 subspecies.\nChamois Appearance\nThe subspecies of the Rupicapra genus differ by habitat range and slightly different in certain physical traits, such as color. However, they are all very small bovids. Fully grown adult chamois reaches 70\u201380 cm (28\u201331 in) in height and 107\u2013137 cm (42\u201354 in) in length. Males are somewhat larger than females, with a weight of 30\u201360 kg (66\u2013132 lb) and 25\u201345 kg (55\u201399 lb), respectively.\nBoth sexes have short, mostly straight horns which curve backward near the tip, with male horns being thicker. Both have rich brown fur which turns into a light chestnut color in spring and summer and long, light grey guard hairs in winter. They have white a long black or brown band from each side of the muzzle to the eyes and ears, white on the rest of the head and throat for contrast, a white rump, and a black stripe along the back. Their hooves are excellent for gripping slippery rock. The tail is not usually visible except when mating.\nReal PIX/Shutterstock.com\nChamois Behavior\nChamois are mostly diurnal animals but can be active at night. Adult males lead solitary lives for most of the year, while female chamois and their young live in hers of 15-30 individuals. Chamois gives a warning call of danger by stamping their feet and making a whistling sound. When alarmed or threatened, they flee to the most inaccessible heights, often by making amazing leaps.\nChamois Habitat\nThe habitat of the chamois is the moderately high, very sleep, rugged and rocky mountains of Europe and Asia Minor. It prefers alpine and subalpine meadows above the timberline and both fairly steep and flatter terrain, moving into forested areas and steep slopes during the winter to avoid the accumulation of snow. The animal is often found at elevations with a minimum height of 3,600 m (11,800 ft), moving to areas predominated by pine trees in lower elevations of around 800 m (2,600 ft) in the winter\nThe chamois\u2019 native habitat range includes the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, Tatra Mountains, the Balkans, parts of Turkey, the Caucasus, and the Apennines. It was introduced into the South Island of New Zealand.\nThe other species of the chamois, R. pyrenaica (Pyrenean chamois) lives in the Pyrenees, the Cantabrian Mountains, and the Apennine Mountains. The 7 subspecies of R. rupicapra have different habitat ranges including:\nChamois Diet\nThe chamois has an herbivorous diet. It eats mainly grasses, herbs, and flowers in the summer, and lichens, mosses, barks, needles, and young pine shoots in the winter. When the snow is so deep that it cannot find food, it has been known to fast for two weeks.\nChamois Predators and threats\nThe common predators of the chamois used to be grey wolves, Eurasian lynxes, and Persian leopards, as well as some brown bears and golden eagles. Humans have established themselves as their main predators, finding them to be popular game animals with tasty meat. Chamois is also used for the soft, pliable leather made from its skin. Common causes of mortality to chamois include the threats of avalanches, epidemics, and human disturbance, competition with livestock for food and space, habitat loss, and hybridization with introduced subspecies. Poaching and overhunting are threats from human predation.\nChamois Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe mating season of the chamois is around late November/early December when males have fierce battles with each other for the attention of unmated females. It is during this time that the tails of both sexes are visible. Pregnant females have a gestation period of 170 days. A baby chamois is called a kid. Females give birth to a single kid or the occasional twins in May or early June.\nIf the mother dies, another females raise the kids. Kids are weaned at 6 months and are fully grown at one year, but they do not reach sexual maturity until 3-4 years of age, with some females ready to mate as early as 2 years old. Once the males reach sexual maturity, dominant males force them out of their mothers\u2019 herds. They then wander nomadically until they establish themselves through breeding at 8-9 years.\nChamois typically live up to 22 years in captivity and 15-17 years in the wild.\nChamois Population\nThe latest estimated population of these animals in Europe is approximately 400,000. Since they were introduced into New Zealand in the 20th century due to environmental changes in their native habitat, their numbers rapidly increased to almost 100,000 by the 1970s and they threatened the local vegetation. Since then, the chamois population has decreased by about 20,000.\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, the northern chamois populations are of least concern and are remaining stable. The southern chamois populations are of least concern and increasing.\nChamois In the Zoo\nThese animals are difficult to house in zoos, instead of being a common captive species in a number of game parks and nonscientific institutions in Europe. However, it can be seen at the Toronto Zoo and the Munich Zoo Hellabrunn.\nView all 153 animals that start with C"}

The word Canis is Latin for dog and aureus means golden. So, it makes sense that another name for the common jackal is the golden jackal. Its family is Canidae and its class is Mammalia.\nAlong with the common jackal, there are two other species including the side-striped jackal and the black-backed jackal. The only difference between these three species is the color of their coat and the specific habitat they prefer to live in.\nJackal Appearance and Behavior\nThe common jackal has a coat that is a mixture of yellow, brown, and gold. The appearance of a jackal\u2019s coat can become darker or lighter with the change of seasons. If you have a dog, you may notice that its coat gets thicker or changes color a little bit with the seasons. A similar process happens with these animals.\nThis animal has a long slim nose, large ears, and even a bushy tail that makes it look very similar to a fox. Remember, foxes and jackals are close relatives! Jackals have four slender legs, a trim body, and dark eyes that are always keeping watch on its surroundings.\nA jackal measures around 16 inches tall from its shoulder and weighs from 11 to 26 pounds. If you put one number two pencil on top of another, then you are looking at about the height of a common jackal. Alternatively, a 26-pound jackal weighs about the same as an average-sized dachshund.\nThese canines are fast runners, with the fastest speed for a jackal being 40 mph. They can run in short bursts of tremendous speed or for longer periods of time at a lower rate of speed. This speed helps them catch their prey and can keep them safe from some predators.\nThe color of their coat helps it to blend in with its territory. Just think of how easily a common jackal would disappear into the light brown grass on the African savanna! This camouflaging helps to protect it if predators are in the area.\nA jackal that is walking alone is likely to run away from a threat while a large group of jackals may stand their ground against a predator. A pack of jackals may even be able to overwhelm a leopard or a hyena. At the very least, a large pack may be able to chase the predator away.\nThese canines are known to defend their territory using their sharp teeth and claws to drive any intruders away. A jackal\u2019s fierce protection of its territory is a characteristic it shares with its wolf, fox, and coyote cousins. Not only is it protecting its home, but it\u2019s also protecting any pups in the area.\nJackals live in groups that can number anywhere from 10 to 30. They are called packs or tribes. These animals are normally shy and try to stay out of sight by taking cover in tall grass, in crevices of rocks, or behind trees. The only time they show aggression is when their territory is threatened by an intruder.\nOne of the most interesting things about these animals is their form of communication. In short, not all howls, growls, and yips are alike in the world of jackals. The members of a pack or tribe have unique sounds they make in order to deliver a message to the rest of their family. All packs of jackals have their own sounds, so families in the area don\u2019t receive mixed messages!\nOne howling sound may mean that a jackal has killed prey and wants everyone in the family to eat. A yipping sound may warn other members of a pack there\u2019s a predator in the area. The side-striped jackal is said to make a hooting sound similar to an owl. This unique sound has earned it the nickname \u2018o loo\u2019 in Uganda.\nJackal Habitat\nThese animals live in Africa and some European countries. In Africa, they\u2019re found in the western and central part of the continent in Senegal, Nigeria, and South Sudan. They also live further south in Zambia and Zimbabwe.\nThe specific type of habitat a jackal lives in differs depending on which of the three species you\u2019re looking at. Common or golden jackals live in savannas and deserts while side-striped jackals prefer wetter habitats like marshes, bushlands, and even the mountains. The black-backed jackal lives in woodlands and savannas. Though the regions are different, all three species can be found in Africa.\nThe long legs and sturdy feet of these canines allow them to easily travel the lengthy stretches of land while hunting. Their paws can withstand the heat as well as the rough dry ground. They use their sense of hearing and smell more than their vision to find prey. They are active mostly at dusk and dawn. This is so they can avoid moving around in the hottest part of the day. Like domesticated dogs, they sleep a lot in the daytime.\nJackal Diet\nWhat do these canines eat? These canines are omnivores eating birds, berries, plants, rabbits, frogs, fruits, snakes, and small antelopes. Some scientists refer to jackals as opportunistic feeders. This means that they may steal leftover meat from prey killed by another animal. They take the opportunity to eat whenever they find food even if they didn\u2019t hunt or kill it.\nUsually, these canines hunt in pairs. This is so they can work together to trap and take down their prey. Though they have sharp teeth, these creatures are small, so it helps for two jackals to be cooperating as they hunt \u2013 especially if they\u2019re going after larger prey.\nJackal Predators and Threats\nThese canines have a few predators including eagles, leopards, and hyenas. All of these predators have great speed, strength, or both, making it fairly easy to capture a young jackal. It\u2019s not unusual for an eagle to fly down and capture a pup that\u2019s playing outside its den.\nSometimes when their food sources are scarce, these animals make their way onto a farmer\u2019s property to kill livestock. Some jackals are shot by farmers for this reason. Another human threat to them is the loss of habitat due to land development and construction.\nThe official conservation status of these animals, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is least concern. In fact, their population is believed to be on the rise.\nJackal Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThis canine has just one mate throughout its life. The mating season for the common jackal goes from October to March. The gestation period is 57 to 70 days. Coyotes, foxes, and wolves have a gestation period of about the same number of days.\nA male and female work together to find or make an underground den where the babies will be born. A female gives live birth to two to four babies, also called pups. Newborn pups are very small weighing less than a pound. They are born blind and nurse from their mother as well as consuming small amounts of soft food. At ten days old, the pups\u2019 eyes open and at two months they begin to eat solid food.\nBecause they are so small, pups are vulnerable to attacks from eagles, leopards, and hyenas. In fact, many of these pups don\u2019t survive to 14 weeks old. As a way to protect her pups, a mother moves her litter to different underground dens every few weeks. This makes it challenging for a predator to pick up and stay with the scent of the pups.\nBoth the mother and father care for the pups teaching them how to hunt when they are about six months old. A pup may leave its parents at 11 months of age to strike out on its own. Or it may stay with its parents to help care for other pups in other litters.\nJackals living in the wild live to be 10 to 12 years old. Wild jackals are vulnerable to many of the same ailments that a dog might face. For instance, they can contract rabies. A jackal that is old or injured is also more likely to be targeted by a predator than a young, healthy animal.\nOf course, these canines that are well cared for in a zoo or wildlife preserve can live longer, up to 16 years old.\nJackal Population\nThe population of common jackals in India is more than 80,000. However, scientists are unsure of the population of these animals in Africa.\nThe population of this species of jackal is believed to be increasing. Its official conservation status is least concern.\nView all 25 animals that start with J"}

These elusive cats are rarely seen, but they are certainly present in the mountains around Big Sky. These predators used to range from Canada to the end of South America.\nToday it is estimated that roughly 30,000 mountain lions live in the mountains of the western US. Montana FWP estimates that 5700 potentially live in Montana. Have you seen a lion in Montana?\nMountain Lion | Photo: Pixabay\nLet's take a look at some interesting facts about Mountain Lions:\nThe scientific name for a mountain lion is Puma concolor.\nMountain lions are often called cougars or pumas.\nFemales weigh 85 to 120 pounds. Males weigh 120-180 pounds.\nThey may measure 7 to 8 feet from nose to tail and stand 2 to 3 feet at shoulder.\nLions typically live 8 to 10 years in the wild.\nLion tracks measure roughly 3\". They have a bi-lobed main pad with four teardrop shaped toes.\nLions can bound 40 feet while running, leap 15 feet up into a tree, climb a 12 foot fence, and sprint up to 50 mph!\nFemales breed at two years, after they establish their territory.\nLion gestation is 92 days and they give birth every two years.\nMost litters consist of 2-4 kittens that are born in warmer months. Litter mates will travel together for several months.\nBabies are called kittens or cubs. They usually have spots for 1 year. They are a tawny color as adult.\nLion Cubs | Photo: Pixabay\nLions were classified as a game animal in Montana in 1971. Lions can be hunted from September to April.\nThey primarily prey on elk and deer. But will also prey on other animals - including porcupine.\nLions silently stalk and ambush their prey when they have the opportunity to pounce.\nLions can be seen any time, but are most active at dusk and dawn. A physical adaptation allows them to see at night.\nAdults leave \"scrapes\" along their territorial boundaries. Scrapes are \"a four to six inch mound of dirt and forest litter pulled together where the cat deposits urine and dung\" used to mark their area (FWP).\nMale lions have a range of roughly 100 square miles. Females have a range of about 50 square miles. Sub-adults are often transient until they find unoccupied territories.\nWhen you play in the mountains around Big Sky, you are in mountain lion country. Follow the same rules you would in bear country - do not hike alone. Keep kids and pets close by. Carry bear spray. Make noise and be aware.\nMountain Lion | Photo: Pixabay\nMost people will never see a mountain lion. Human encounters are rare in Montana. Visit Montana Fish, Wildlife , & Parks to find out what to do in the event of a lion encounter. If you are attacked by a mountain lion, use bear spray as a deterrent. Try to remain standing, face the animal, and fight back. It is legal to kill a mountain lion with a firearm in self defense in Montana, but you must report it within 72 hours.\nIt sounds scary, but don't worry too much. You have a better chance of being struck by lighting than of being attacked by a mountain lion.\nIf you capture a photo of a mountain lion be sure to share it on social media with #visitbigsky.\nSee Also:\nLearn more interesting facts about mountain lions from these sources:"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Bilby images!\n\u201cThe Bilby is Australia\u2019s answer to the rabbit, sort of.\u201d\nOf all the charming and unusual creatures found in Australia, the bilby, also called the pinkie, the dalgyte or the rabbit-eared bandicoot is one of the most endearing. An omnivore that looks somewhat like a rabbit with its huge ears and somewhat like a possum with its long tail and long snout, this nearsighted little animal comes out at night to hunt and forage. Considered an ecosystem engineer, the bilby digs pits as it looks for food. These pits become fertile areas that help germinate seeds that would have difficulty sprouting anywhere else. Here are some facts about this little creature:\n5 Incredible Bilby Facts!\nBilbies are marsupials, which means their babies are born in a very underdeveloped state and do most of what would be fetal development in their mother\u2019s pouch.\nThe pouches of female bilbies open at the back, which is unusual.\nBilbies not only dig deep, long, and extensive burrows, but their burrows spiral. This makes it that much harder for predators to find them.\nBilbies are a very old species. There are bilby fossils that date back 15 million years.\nThey don\u2019t need to drink. They get all their water from their food.\nBilby Scientific name\nThe bilby\u2019s scientific name is Macrotis lagotis. Macrotis is Greek for \u201cbig-eared,\u201d and lagotis is derived from \u201clagus,\u201d the Greek word for \u201chare.\u201d There is only one species, the Greater Bilby. The Lesser Bilby is extinct.\nBilby Appearance\nThe pinkie is an animal that\u2019s around 11 to 22 inches long with silver-gray fur that has a silken feel, much like a rabbit\u2019s. Their very long ears are one of the first things that a person notices about them. They not only give the animal an excellent sense of hearing but help cool them down in the hot desert climate. A male bilby is more robust than a female and can weigh twice as much. A large male bilby is about as big as a rabbit. He also has bigger canine teeth and a larger forehead. All bilbies have long snouts with sensitive whiskers.\nUnlike a rabbit, the bilby has a long, tri-colored tail that\u2019s between 7.9 and 11.4 inches long. The first part of the tail is the same color as the body, then it\u2019s black, and the last 40 percent or so is white. The front legs, which are strong for digging, have five toes each. Three of the toes have claws and the other two don\u2019t. Their hind limbs are also strong and kangaroo-like, but the animal prefers to run as opposed to hop.\nAnother interesting fact about bilby physiology is its tongue. Like an anteater\u2019s, the bilby\u2019s tongue is long, thin, and sticky. This allows the animal to gather ants and termites without actually tearing apart their colonies and entering them, for the soft fur offers no protection against bites and stings. The dalgyte also uses its tongue to pick seeds up off the ground. Unfortunately, this also causes bilbies to ingest a good deal of sand and soil, but it doesn\u2019t seem to affect the animal overly much. Bilbies have bad eyesight, but their sense of smell and hearing are acute.\nThe pouch of the female bilby opens in the back so it doesn\u2019t get filled up with dirt as she digs her burrow. She has eight teats, and some are inside her pouch and some are outside. They produce different types of milk. The inside teats help the nearly embryonic joey to develop, and the outside ones provide nourishment for the joey who has left the pouch. Unlike kangaroos, baby bilbies don\u2019t return to their mother\u2019s pouch once they\u2019ve left it.\nCaptive Bilby on red soil.\nBilby Behavior\nBilbies are usually solitary, though two females may sometimes travel and live together. They are expert diggers and can dig several burrows with one entrance and a number of exits, again the better to deter predators. These burrows, unusually, spiral down and can be 6.5 feet deep and nearly 10 feet long. Besides protection from predators, burrows protect the bilby from inclement weather, including the harsh desert sun. They also serve as nurseries where female bilbies keep their babies while they forage. Dalgytes move frequently between their burrows.\nThe home ranges of bilbies tend to overlap, but they are not particularly social save during the breeding season.\nBilbies are nocturnal, so their bad eyesight isn\u2019t an impediment to them hunting and finding food. They leave their burrows at sunset to hunt and come back before the sun rises. Their excellent sense of smell allows them to find caches of buried food and identify other bilbies through the scent markings they leave behind. Their huge ears allow them to hear the movement of underground prey as well as the approach of predators.\nMales mark the entrance to their burrows with their scent, and they also leave their scent in the burrow of a female they\u2019ve mated with. This reinforces a dominance hierarchy among male bilbies. Males of lesser status do not mate with females whose burrows have been marked by a dominant male, and dominant males mark over the scent marks left by subordinate males. Females see no need to scent mark their burrows.\nBilby Habitat\nThe rabbit-eared bandicoot used to be found in 70 percent of Australia, including city parks. Now it is restricted to dry and semi-dry areas with rocky or clay soil, shrublands, and grasslands. It has been extirpated in South Australia, though there are efforts to reintroduce it. The animal actually prefers to live not only in dry areas but in places where there are fires from time to time. Fires cause the plants that it likes to eat to germinate.\nBilby Diet\nThe dalgyte is an omnivore, which means its diet includes plants, animals, and fungi. Animals include worms, snails, insects, and other invertebrates and mammals even smaller than themselves. They\u2019ll also take eggs. When it comes to plant material, bilbies eat bulbs, seeds, nuts, grains, grasses, and fruit. They dig up buried food with their front legs and claws. How much animal or plant material they eat depends on what is available. Because their food gives them all the moisture they need, bilbies don\u2019t need to drink water.\nBilby Predators and Threats\nNormally, bilbies are preyed upon by monitor lizards and birds of prey as well as carpet pythons. However, many of the predators that have helped to decimate the bilby\u2019s numbers were introduced by humans. These include cats, dingos, and red foxes. Dingos were introduced thousands of years ago by the continent\u2019s aborigines, while cats and red foxes were brought over in the 19th century by Europeans. They spread so rapidly that they destroyed and decimated a variety of native Australian animals, including the rabbit-eared bandicoot. Ironically, cats were brought over to control the other pests brought over by settlers, including rabbits, and red foxes were introduced so the settlers could go fox hunting.\nNot only do predators such as cats, foxes, and dingos eat bilbies, they bring diseases to which the dalgyte has no immunity. The bilby picks up these diseases as they dig into the ground contaminated with the waste of these predators. Bilbies are also pushed out of their habitats by human development and are regularly run over by cars on the road. Because of all this, the pinkie\u2019s IUCN conservation status is listed as vulnerable, and it is listed as endangered under the United States Endangered Species List.\nWhat eats the bilby?\nThe bilby is eaten by animals such as dingos, pythons, birds of prey, and monitor lizards. Foxes and cats also prey on the bilby.\nWhat does the bilby eat?\nThe bilby eats mammals smaller than itself, small lizards, insects, snails, termites, ants, and plant material such as seeds, fruit, and bulbs.\nBilby Reproduction and Life Cycle\nBilbies can breed year-round, depending on the environment. The peak breeding season is in late summer to mid-autumn. If conditions are too dry and there\u2019s not much food, a female bilby may delay breeding. If conditions are lush, she can give birth to as many as four litters every year. She\u2019ll usually have one or two joeys, though she can have as many as four.\nThe rabbit-eared bandicoot is polygynous, which means males mate with more than one female. A male mates with a female who\u2019s equal to him in the dominance hierarchy and goes on to mate with females who are lower in the rankings. The male will find a female who is in estrus, follow her around then sniff her. She may sniff him back or reject him if he is of lower status. Then, they\u2019ll mate underground in her burrow. Mating sessions sometimes take the better part of a day. Afterward, he\u2019ll mark her burrow with his scent as a warning to other males to leave her alone, then go off and find another female.\nThe female bilby is pregnant for only two weeks or so, then she\u2019ll give birth to a premature baby that climbs through her fur, finds her pouch, and latches on to a teat. It will stay in the pouch for about 75 days. After the joey leaves the pouch it will not return, but the mother nurses it for about 14 more days. After this, the baby is independent and leaves her burrow for good. It is not unusual for the female to have become pregnant again just as her first baby becomes independent.\nFemale bilbies are ready to breed when they\u2019re about five months old and males when they\u2019re about eight months old.\nThe oldest captive bilby lived for about 10 years, though if they survive infancy, a bilby usually lives six to seven years. Scientists don\u2019t really know how long bilbies live in the wild.\nBilby Population\nThese animals are endangered in its native Australia, and scientists estimate there are less than 10,000 of them left. Their numbers have plummeted due to predation by invasive species and habitat fragmentation and destruction as humans take up more and more of their land.\nView all 184 animals that start with B"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Leopard Animal Facts | Panthera pardus - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/animals/leopard/", "text": "This post may contain affiliate links to our partners like Chewy, Amazon, and others. Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Leopard images!\nLeopard Classification and Evolution\nThe Leopard is a medium-sized wildcat that is natively found in a variety of different habitats across sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. A member of the \u201cBig Cat\u201d family, the Leopard is an agile and opportunistic hunter that has been able to exploit habitats unused by other large felines as it spends a great deal of its time high in the tree branches. There are seven different sub-species of Leopard which differ in their appearance and geographic location, with the African Leopard being the most common and widespread and the others being the rare Amur Leopard, the Anatolian Leopard, the Barbary Leopard, the Sinai Leopard, the South Arabian Leopard and the Zanzibar Leopard. Although the African Leopard populations are stable throughout much of their natural range, the story is different for the remaining sub-species that are often isolated and critically at risk (the Zanzibar Leopard is actually now thought to be extinct).\nLeopard Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Leopard is an animal with a long and slender body that is supported by short, stocky legs and a long tail that is used to aid balance whilst in the trees. Leopards can vary greatly in their colouration and markings depending on their surrounding habitat, with those found on open grasslands having a light yellow background coat where those that are found in forests tend to be darker in colour and with more markings. The dark, ring-like patterns that cover the Leopard\u2019s coat are called rosettes, but these turn to solid spots on the face and limbs (and rings on the tail) and provide the Leopard with camouflage into the surrounding environment. Leopards are incredibly strong and muscular animals and are able to pull themselves up trees using their legs and retractable claws. Like a number of other large feline species, the Leopard is able to draw their claws into folds of skin on their paws to ensure that they are not blunted whilst the animal is walking about. Their keen hearing and sight coupled with their long and very sensitive whiskers, means that Leopards are also incredibly well adapted for hunting under the cover of night.\nLeopard Distribution and Habitat\nLeopards are not only the widest ranging of all Big Cats but are actually one of the most adaptable and are found in a variety of different habitats. Commonly found throughout sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, there are also small and isolated populations of Leopard inhabiting remote geographic locations in the Far East, Northern Africa and Arabia. The Leopard can be found inhabiting numerous different areas providing that there is a good source of cover and an ample supply of food including tropical rainforests, tree-lined savannah, barren deserts and mountain highlands. One of the reasons why they are thought to be still surviving successfully throughout much of their natural range is that Leopards have adapted to the growing presence of people and are known to both live and hunt in areas close to urban activity. However, in some parts of their natural range populations are threatened by loss of their natural habitats to both deforestation and growing settlements.\nLeopard Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe Leopard is a solitary and nocturnal animal that hunts both on the ground and in the trees. They are excellent climbers and spend the vast majority of the daytime hours resting in the shade of the branches in the trees or under a sheltered rock. They are quite unique amongst large felines as Leopards rely heavily on being able to get close enough to their prey before ambushing it, rather than expelling vast amounts of energy in a high-speed chase. Once caught and killed, the prey is then dragged to safety either into dense vegetation a couple of hundred meters away or up a tree trunk and into the branches. Leopards are highly solitary animals that mark their territory using scent markings and by producing rough, rasping calls that are said to sound like the sawing through coarse wood. Home range sizes vary depending on the habitat and the food available but those of male Leopards are significantly larger than those of their female counterparts, which often overlap the ranges of a number of both males and other females (sometimes by up to 40%).\nLeopard Reproduction and Life Cycles\nThroughout their natural range, Leopards have no distinctive breeding season with females instead being able to reproduce every couple of months. After a gestation period that lasts for around three months, the female Leopard gives birth to between 2 and 6 cubs that are born blind and weigh just half a kilo. Leopard cubs are incredibly vulnerable in the wild and so remain hidden in dense vegetation until they are able to follow their mother around at between 6 and 8 weeks of age, camouflaged by their dark, woolly fur and blurry spots. Weaned at around three months old, Leopard cubs will remain with their mother for another 18 months until she is ready to mate again and encourages her young to independently establish their own territories. Although male Leopards are almost entirely solitary except when mating, female Leopards may not stray too far from their mother and often establish a home range that overlaps hers. Leopards tend to live for between ten and fifteen years in the wild, depending on the habitat and the food supply available.\nLeopard Diet and Prey\nThe Leopard is a silent and opportunistic hunter that only hunts and kills other animals in order to survive. The Leopards primarily hunts medium sized mammals such as Deer and Warthogs, that are often ambushed from the branches above or dense vegetation just meters away. The Leopard however, also eats a wide variety of small prey including birds, reptiles and rodents even hunting Dung Beetles when larger animals are scarce. By eating much smaller (and a wider variety) of prey Leopards are able to avoid intense competition for food from other large carnivores like Tigers and Hyenas, with which they share parts of their natural range. They are also very stealthy creatures that drag their kill into dense vegetation or up into the trees for safety from scavengers close-by. Leopards are incredibly strong and are capable of taking prey much heavier than themselves such as Antelopes, which are then remarkably hauled into the safety of the branches to either be eaten immediately or cached (saved for later).\nLeopard Predators and Threats\nDue to the fact that the Leopard is a stealthy and apex predator throughout its natural environment, generally the biggest threat to adult Leopards is other Leopards, along with the occasional Lion or Tiger that can get close enough. Young Leopard cubs however, are much more vulnerable and the fact that they have numerous natural predators leads them to remain hidden in dense vegetation for their first couple of months. Although, it is during the times when their mother is off hunting that Leopard cubs are most at threat from Hyenas, Jackals, Lions, Tigers, Snakes and Birds of Prey. Despite their adaptability to differing surroundings, Leopard populations in parts of their natural range are declining due to both habitat loss to the timber industry and agriculture, and hunting by Humans as trophies and for their meat and fur.\nLeopard Interesting Facts and Features\nOriginally thought to be a hybrid of the Lion and the Jaguar, the Leopard has been the subject of much genetic confusion and wasn\u2019t really distinguished properly until just over 100 years ago. Some of the confusion is thought to come from the Black Panther which is a Leopard that has a completely black coat of fur, with occasional faint markings. Known as melanism, the genetic mutation that causes large amounts of a dark pigment to occur in the skin and fur is exhibited by a number of mammalian species. Black Panthers tend to occur most in dense forests with larger populations being found in southern Asia than in Africa, and are born into a litter that also contains yellow cubs. Black Panthers are actually fairly common and amazingly enough, it is thought that up to 50% of the Leopards found inhabiting the thick, tropical rainforests of the Malay Peninsula are black.\nLeopard Relationship with Humans\nSince big game hunting took off in Africa, the Leopard has been one of the most sought-after animals for hunters to kill. Part of the African \u201cBig Five\u201d which are the most desirable animals for sports hunters, Leopards in some areas particularly have been severely affected by trophy hunting. In many places Leopards are also often persecuted by local people who kill them for their meat and fur, and also because they are seen as pests to farms and livestock due to their lack of fear of people (although they are very seldom seen). However, recent booms in the tourist industry in Africa has meant that more and more people are paying for the privilege to see one of these majestic animals in the wild, bringing money into local communities. This leads to Leopards being more protected by local people rather than persecuted, as Leopards are providing an important and new-found source of a good income for the local people.\nLeopard Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Leopard is listed by the IUCN as being an animal that is Near Threatened in its natural environment as populations are stable throughout much of its vast natural range. A number of Leopard sub-species however, are considered to be either Endangered or Critically Endangered in their native habitats and one is thought to now be extinct. This is thought to be due to the fact that these populations are either small or geographically isolated and are severely affected by local hunting and habitat loss. In a number of African countries however, Leopards are still legally hunted as trophies by sports hunters with annual quotas allocated by CITES (The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).\nView all 55 animals that start with L"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Liger - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger", "text": "Lion and tigress hybrid\nThe liger is a hybrid offspring of a male lion (Panthera leo) and a female tiger (Panthera tigris). The liger has parents in the same genus but of different species. The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid called the tigon, and is the largest of all known extant felines. They enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than either parent species, unlike tigons.\nHistory\nThe history of lion-tiger hybrids dates to at least the early 19th century in India. In 1798, \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772\u20131844) made a colour plate of the offspring of a lion and a tiger. The name \"liger\", a portmanteau of lion and tiger, was coined by the 1930s. \"Ligress\" is used to refer to a female liger, on the model of \"tigress\".\nIn 1825, G. B. Whittaker made an engraving of liger cubs born in 1824. The parents and their three liger offspring are also depicted with their trainer in a 19th-century painting in the na\u00efve style.\nTwo liger cubs born in 1837 were exhibited to King William IV and to his successor Queen Victoria. On 14 December 1900 and on 31 May 1901, Carl Hagenbeck wrote to zoologist James Cossar Ewart with details and photographs of ligers born at the Hagenbeck's Tierpark in Hamburg in 1897.\nIn Animal Life and the World of Nature (1902\u20131903), A. H. Bryden described Hagenbeck's \"lion-tiger\" hybrids:\nIt has remained for one of the most enterprising collectors and naturalists of our time, Mr. Carl Hagenbeck, not only to breed but to bring successfully to a healthy maturity, specimens of this rare alliance between those two great and formidable Felidae, the lion and tiger. The illustrations will indicate sufficiently how fortunate Mr. Hagenbeck has been in his efforts to produce these hybrids. The oldest and biggest of the animals shown is a hybrid born on the 11th May 1897. This fine beast, now more than five years old, equals and even excels in his proportions a well-grown lion, measuring as he does from nose tip to tail 10 ft 2 inches in length, and standing only three inches less than 4 ft at the shoulder. A good big lion will weigh about 400 lb [...] the hybrid in question, weighing as it does no less than 467 lb, is certainly the superior of the most well-grown lions, whether wild-bred or born in a menagerie. This animal shows faint striping and mottling, and, in its characteristics, exhibits strong traces of both its parents. It has a somewhat lion-like head, and the tail is more like that of a lion than of a tiger. On the other hand, it has no trace of mane. It is a huge and very powerful beast.\nIn 1935, four ligers from two litters were reared in the Zoological Gardens of Bloemfontein, South Africa. Three of them, a male and two females, were still living in 1953. The male weighed 340 kg (750 lb) and stood a foot and a half (45 cm) taller than a full grown male lion at the shoulder.\nAlthough ligers are more commonly found than tigons today, in At Home in the Zoo (1961), Gerald Iles wrote \"For the record I must say that I have never seen a liger, a hybrid obtained by crossing a lion with a tigress. They seem to be even rarer than tigons.\"\nAppearance\nThe liger has a faint tiger-like striped pattern upon a lionesque tawny background. In addition, it may inherit rosettes from the lion parent (lion cubs are rosetted and some adults retain faint markings). These markings may be black, dark brown or sandy. The background color may be correspondingly tawny, sandy or golden. In common with tigers, as an example of countershading, the underparts are pale. The specific pattern and color depend upon which subspecies the parents were and how the genes interact in the offspring.\nWhite tigers have been crossed with lions to produce \"white\" (actually pale golden) ligers. In theory, white tigers could be crossed with white lions to produce white, very pale or even stripeless ligers. There are no black ligers. Very few melanistic tigers have ever been recorded, most being due to excessive markings (pseudo-melanism or abundism) rather than true melanism; no reports of black lions have ever been substantiated. As blue or Maltese tigers probably no longer exist, gray or blue ligers are exceedingly improbable. It is not impossible for a liger to be white, but it is very rare. The first known white ligers were born in December 2013 at Myrtle Beach Safari in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to a white male lion and a white female tiger.\nSize and growth\nThe liger is often believed to be the largest known cat in the world. Males reach a total length of 3 to 3.6 m (9.8 to 11.8 ft), which means that they rival even large male lions and tigers in length. Imprinted genes may be a factor contributing to the large size of ligers. These are genes that may or may not be expressed on the parent they are inherited from, and that occasionally play a role in issues of hybrid growth. For example, in some dog breed crosses, genes that are expressed only when maternally-inherited cause the young to grow larger than is typical for either parent breed. This growth is not seen in the paternal breeds, as such genes are normally \"counteracted\" by genes inherited from the female of the appropriate breed.\nOther big cat hybrids can reach similar sizes; the litigon, a rare hybrid of a male lion and a female tigon, is roughly the same size as the liger, with a male named Cubanacan (at the Alipore Zoo in India) reaching 363 kg (800 lb). The extreme rarity of these second-generation hybrids may make it difficult to ascertain whether they are larger or smaller, on average, than the liger.\nIt is sometimes wrongly believed that ligers continue to grow throughout their lives due to hormonal issues. It may be that they simply grow far more during their growing years and take longer to reach their full adult size. Further growth in shoulder height and body length is not seen in ligers over six years old, as in both lions and tigers. Male ligers also have the same levels of testosterone on average as an adult male lion, yet are azoospermic in accordance with Haldane's rule. In addition, female ligers may also attain great size, weighing approximately 320 kg (705 lb) and reaching 3.05 m (10 ft) long on average, and are often fertile. In contrast, pumapards (hybrids between pumas and leopards) tend to exhibit dwarfism.\nLigers are about the same size as the prehistoric Smilodon populator and American lion.\nRecords\nHercules, the largest non-obese liger, is recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest living cat on Earth, weighing 418.2 kg (922 lb). Hercules was featured on the Today Show, Good Morning America, Anderson Cooper 360, Inside Edition, and in a Maxim article in 2005, when he was only three years old and already weighed 408.25 kg (900 lb).\nThe Valley of the Kings Animal Sanctuary in Wisconsin had a male liger named Nook who weighed over 550 kg (1,213 lb).\nTo compare, the records for the lion and tiger in captivity are under 1,100 pounds (500 kg).\nHealth and longevity\nThough ligers typically have a life expectancy of between 13 and 18 years, they are occasionally known to live into their 20s. A ligress named Shasta was born at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City on 14 May 1948 and died in 1972 at age 24. Nook, a liger at a facility in Wisconsin, died in 2007, at 21 years old. Hobbs, a male liger at the Sierra Safari Zoo in Reno, Nevada, lived to almost 15 years of age before succumbing to liver failure, and weighed 450 kg (992 lb).\nPanthera hybrids tend to experience a higher rate of injury and neurological disorder than non-hybrids. Though not universal, ligers and tigons may develop health issues. Organ failure issues have been reported in ligers, in addition to neurological deficits, sterility, cancer, and arthritis.\nFertility\nThe fertility of hybrid big cat females is well documented across a number of different hybrids. This is in accordance with Haldane's rule: in hybrids of animals whose sex is determined by sex chromosomes, if one of the two sexes is absent, rare or sterile, it will be the heterogametic sex. Male ligers are consequently sterile, while female ligers are not.\nLigers and tigons were long thought to be totally sterile. However, in 1943, a fifteen-year-old hybrid between a lion and an island tiger was successfully mated with a lion at the Munich Hellabrunn Zoo. The female cub, though of delicate health, was raised to adulthood.\nIn September 2012, the Russian Novosibirsk Zoo announced the birth of a \"liliger\", the offspring of a liger mother and a lion father. The cub was named Kiara.\nCo-occurrence of parent species\nAs with the tigon, the liger exists only in captivity. Historically, the Asiatic lion and the Bengal tiger co-occurred in some Asian countries, and there are legends of male lions mating with tigresses in the wilderness, or of ligers existing there. The two species' ranges are known to overlap in India's Gir National Park, though no ligers were known to live there until the modern era. The range of the Caspian tiger has overlapped with that of the lion in places such as northern Iran and eastern Anatolia.\nZoo policies\nKeeping the two species separate has been standard procedure.[citation needed] However, ligers have occurred, and do occur, by accident in captivity. Several AZA zoos are reported to have ligers.[citation needed] The USA holds the greatest population of around 30 ligers. China holds about 20 ligers. There are a few countries worldwide that hold a few, but probably less than 100 exist worldwide.\nThe breeding of ligers and other Panthera hybrids has come under fire from animal rights activists and organisations, who argue that the health problems experienced by these animals makes their creation immoral. Despite these assertions of immorality, some zoos still breed ligers for profit.\nSee also\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from messybeast.com, which is released under the GFDL.\nFurther reading"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Puma images!\nPuma Classification and Evolution\nThe Puma is a large, secretive Cat predominantly found in the mountains from southern Canada to the tip of South America. Also commonly known as the Cougar and the Mountain Lion, Pumas are able to reach larger sizes than some \u2018big\u2019 cat individuals but despite their large size they are believed to be more closely related to smaller feline species. Due to their extensive distribution, there are 7 subspecies of Puma all of which share similar characteristics but tend to vary slightly in colour and occasionally size. The Puma is thought to be one of the most adaptable felines on the American continents as they are found in a variety of different habitats and unlike numerous Cat species, the Puma has no markings on its fur leading to its scientific name Felis concolor which means \u2018cat of one colour\u2019.\nPuma Anatomy and Appearance\nDue to the fact that the majority of Pumas are found in more mountainous regions, they have a thick coat of fur which helps to keep them warm in the freezing winters. Depending on the subspecies and location, the Puma\u2019s fur varies in colour from brown-yellow to grey-red, with those individuals found in colder regions being more grey and those found in warmer areas having more of a red tinge to their fur. The Puma is an incredibly powerful predator and has muscular hind legs that are slightly longer and stronger than the front, which makes them more agile when leaping. They also have enormous paws which are very large in comparison to their body size. The Puma is an animal with large wide-set eyes which not only enable it to see what is ahead of it, but they can also see for some distance around them as well. They have pointed ears and their acute hearing allows them to detect prey even when it is too dark for them to see.\nPuma Distribution and Habitat\nThe Puma is an animal that is found in the mountains throughout South and North America where it inhabits rocky crags and pastures slightly lower down than the slopes than the grazing herbivores. Although these seem to be the Puma\u2019s preferred conditions they are extremely adaptable animals that can be found in a variety of habitats including forests, tropical jungle, grasslands and even in more arid desert regions. However, with expanding Human settlements and land clearance for agriculture, the Puma is being pushed into smaller pockets of its historically vast range, retreating into more hostile mountain environments that are further away from people. It is widely believed however that the Puma\u2019s adaptability has been vital in ensuring that it doesn\u2019t disappear from the wild forever.\nPuma Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe Puma is a solitary animal with the exception of the time cubs spend with their mother. Pumas patrol large home ranges in search of food which varies from 80 square miles in the summer to 40 in the winter, when the falling snow restricts access to a number of mountain areas. Some regions can become so hostile that Pumas migrate from the mountain forests and go down into the valleys to escape the worst of the cold. Not only can Pumas easily adapt to different surroundings but they are also able to hunt effectively during the day or night. Their strong and muscular hind legs and large paws mean that the Puma can move about amongst the rocks more quickly and with greater agility. Pumas are known to make a variety of different sounds, particularly when warning another Puma away from their territory and during the mating season when they are looking for a mate.\nPuma Reproduction and Life Cycles\nThe breeding season tends to occur between December and March with litters of up to 6 cubs being born after a three month gestation period, generally between February and September. After mating, the male and the female part company and he will continue to mate with other females for the duration of the season. Like numerous other felines, Puma cubs are born blind and are completely helpless for their first two weeks of life until their blue eyes fully open. Unlike the one-colour adult Pumas, cubs are born with spots on their fur which helps them to be more easily camouflaged from hungry predators. They are able to eat solid food when they are between 2 and 3 months old and remain with their mother for about a year. Many Pumas live to an average age of 12 years but they have been known to reach 25 years old in captivity.\nPuma Diet and Prey\nThe Puma is a large and powerful carnivore, hunting and eating only other animals in order to survive. The majority of the Puma\u2019s diet is comprised of small animals like Mice, Rats, Birds, Fish and Rabbits that are found living in a high abundance on the fertile mountain slopes and in the lowland forests. The large size of the Puma though also means that it can hunt bigger animals including Sheep, Raccoons, Goats and livestock which it catches by pouncing onto the animal to secure it. The Puma is not only big, but its agile and incredibly muscular body means that it can easily outrun many of the species that it hunts.\nPuma Predators and Threats\nThe Puma is one of the most dominant predators throughout much of their natural environment and are therefore rarely preyed upon by other species. It has been known however, for Pumas that are vulnerable due to sickness or injury to be preyed upon by other large predators including Bears and Wolves, and even other Pumas. The biggest threat to the Puma however, is people who have not only hunted this large Cat (mainly for its fur) but the Puma has also been subjected to drastic habitat loss throughout much of its natural range, mainly due to expanding Human settlements and deforestation for agriculture. In some areas they are also hunted by ranch owners who blame Pumas for their loss of livestock.\nPuma Interesting Facts and Features\nOne of the most obvious reasons as to why this large and powerful feline is not classified as one of the world\u2019s \u2018big\u2019 Cats is that Pumas are not able to roar. This is something distinctive to the \u2018big\u2019 Cat family as no other feline is able to do so. The powerful hind legs of the Puma are so muscular that they not only allow them to pounce on and secure their prey, but they are also able to leap enormous distances of up to 20ft. One of the most famous subspecies of Puma is the Florida Panther which is the smallest of the Puma species and also the rarest. Thought to be on the brink of extinction, this endangered animal has more of a red tinge to the fur on its back along with having a dark spot in the centre.\nPuma Relationship with Humans\nThe Puma is a fearsome predator and although attacks on Humans are rare, they do occur nonetheless. There have been nearly 100 recorded attacks on Humans but most of these occur because the Puma has been cornered or feels threatened in some way. Rare cases of severe starvation have also led to Pumas attacking Humans although this is not that common as people are not generally seen as prey to them. Puma population numbers throughout both North and South America have been declining over the past century particularly, mainly due to habitat loss and the shooting of Pumas by farmers who fear for their animals.\nPuma Conservation Status and Life Today\nDespite being pushed into smaller regions of their vast historical range, the Puma has been listed by the IUCN as an animal that is of Least Concern of becoming extinct in its natural environment in the immediate future. This is because Pumas are not only incredibly adaptable animals but they are also quite common in the more remote mountainous regions. In fact, many feel that it is the Pumas ability to adapt to a number of different environments that has been the reason as to why the population is still as numerous as it is.\nView all 112 animals that start with P"}

Their coloring and markings are so similar that it is difficult for people to distinguish them. The difference lies in the center of the Jaguars rosettes, because unlike the leopard, the Jaguar has spots inside of its rosettes! The Jag is also a much stockier animal than its cousin, with shorter legs and tail \u2013 giving it more of a pit bull type appearance.\nLeopard coat pattern Jaguar coat pattern\nSAVEJAGS\nThe name Jaguar comes from the ancient Indian name \u201cyaguar\u201d which meant \u201cthe killer which overcomes its prey in a single bound.\u201d\nSize and Appearance: Jags are the largest felines in the Americas. Adult males can reach an overall length of more than 7 feet, and can weigh anywhere from 150 to 200 pounds. As mentioned above, its coat color and markings are very similar to the leopard, with a rich tawny or yellow background with large black rosettes and spots. It has a larger head, more compact body, and much more powerful paws! The Jaguar also occurs with an all black (melanistic) coat, and like the leopard, the spots can still be seen on black individuals. Albino individuals have been reported as well.\nHabitat: The Jaguar is commonly found in rain forests, savannahs, and swamps, but at the northern end of its territory it may enter scrub country and even deserts. The Jaguar still has a stronghold in the Amazon basin, but has been nearly wiped out of all drier regions. Wherever it is found, it requires fresh water as the Jaguar is an excellent swimmer. To see Jaguars in the wild, or help them there, check out www.guato.org\nDistribution: Once found here in the United States (California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, Florida), this cat was hunted to extinction here in the late 1940s. Today, it is found in Mexico, but swiftly declining and Central America, and the strongest populations being found in the Mato Grosso, Brazil; The Pantanal, bordering Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay; Chiapas State, Mexico; and the Yucatan Peninsula/northern Guatemala/Belize.\nReproduction and Offspring: Jaguars have no defined breeding season and will mate any time of year. After a gestation period of about 100 days, the female will give birth to a litter of 2-4 cubs. Mothers will continue to feed and protect her young until they are about 1 year old, and they will continue to stay with her until they are about 2 years old. They will reach sexual maturity between 2-3 years for females, and 3-4 for males.\nIn captivity, jags lived over 20 years, as compared to 11 \u2013 12 in the wild.\nSocial System and Communication: The Jaguar is solitary and terrestrial, although it is an adept tree climber. It marks its territory with urine and tree scrapes, in the same fashion as the other great cats. It has a variety of vocalizations, including, roars, grunts, and meows.\nHunting and Diet: Jaguars will pursue almost any kind of animal prey within its range, with its favorite being the peccary (a type of wild pig) and the capybara (the worlds largest rodent). Other food items are caiman, tapirs, and fish. Jaguars differ from all the other cats in their method of killing. Once they\u2019ve caught their prey they pierce the skulls with their canines, demonstrating the amazing strength of their powerful jaws. They were once presumed to be nocturnal, but recent studies have shown that they are active during the daytime, with high peaks of activity during dawn and dusk. Jaguars are also more energetic than their larger cousins, and are active for 50-60% of a 24 hour period.\nThreats: Deforestation rates are high in Latin America and fragmentation of forest habitat isolates jaguar populations so that they are more vulnerable to the predations of man. People compete with jaguars for prey, and jaguars are frequently shot on sight, despite protective legislation. Jaguars are also known to kill cattle, and are killed by ranchers as pest species. The vulnerability of the jaguar to persecution is demonstrated by its disappearance by the mid-1900\u2019s from the south-western US and northern Mexico. Commercial hunting and trapping of jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970\u2019s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets.\nStatus: CITES: Appendix I. IUCN: Near Threatened. The jaguar is fully protected at the national level across most of its range, with hunting prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, United States, Uruguay and Venezuela, and hunting restrictions in place in Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru. The species also occurs within protected areas in some of its range.\nHow rare is this cat ? The International Species Information Service lists 292 worldwide, with 95 being in the U.S. Felid TAG recommendation: Jaguar (Pantherinae Panthera onca). Although perhaps the longest-lived large felid species, the recently approved SSP found the North American population in AZA zoos and most other locations to be aging and virtually untraceable. As this time, only 22 of the 95 U.S. jaguars can be traced back to nature. This population is being managed as an education population because of its relative abundance in many parts of its range. Additional founders are expected to be periodically available for inclusion into the SSP. The target population is 120 individuals.\nHow rare is this cat ?

We participated in an AZA sanctioned study by being the only facility to provide tracking information via detailed photos and casts of paw prints from our captive South American Pumas so that they could be discerned from jaguar tracks in Costa Rica. This will help researchers determine local populations and their habits so that land can be protected for their future.\nNational Geographic aired a wonderful documentary by Dr. Alan Rabinowitz called, In Search of the Jaguar.\nJaguar Sound\nBig Cat Rescue Helps Protect Jaguars in Belize\nBelize Jaguar Project: In January 2015 an enclosure for two displaced wild jaguars, Lady Hill and Mistletoe, in Belize was sponsored in honor of all of the Big Cat Rescue volunteers, interns, and staff. Since then the team at the Belize Zoo has been working through the rainy season to build the enclosure.\nThe main structure is now complete and includes night houses, swimming pools, and lots of natural habitat for these two jaguars to enjoy. The last step is to roof the enclosure, which they are currently working on. Here are a few photos of the progress.\nThese two jaguars were nuisance cats who came into very close proximity to where people reside. In order to spare their lives they were trapped and taken to the Belize Zoo which is a sanctuary for native wildlife that can not be released back into the wild.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Raccoon images!\nSporting a black mask and ringed tail, the raccoon is among the most common mammals in North America.\nBoth vilified as a nuisance and loved for its fascinating behavior, the raccoon in an intelligent, clever animal that gets up to trouble with surprising enthusiasm and alacrity. A true survivor of the animal kingdom, it has thrived in the midst of human activity when so many other species have declined.\nLearn about the smartest animals on earth here.\n4 Incredible Raccoon Facts!\nThe name of the raccoon is adapted from a native Powhatan term meaning \u201canimal that scratches with its hands.\u201d The Powhatan were native to Virginia.\nPeople have interacted with these animals for as long as humans settled in the Americas. Raccoons were considered to be an object of mythology. They were also a source of food for Native Americans and European settlers alike. And since their fur was fashioned into hats and coats, entire industries sprung up around trapping it.\nRaccoons are animals with exquisitely sensitive paws, which contain four to five times as many sensory cells as the rest of the body. Approximately three-quarters of the sensory part of the brain is dedicated to touch alone.\nThe raccoon\u2019s evolutionary ancestor probably originated in Europe some 25 million years ago. After crossing over to the Americas, these ancestors settled in the tropics around Central or South America. Once modern raccoons evolved, they spread back north to the temperate climates.\nRaccoon Scientific Name\nThe scientific name of the raccoon is Procyon lotor. Procyon is a Greek term that roughly means \u201cbefore the dog\u201d or \u201cdog-like\u201d (it also happens to be the name of a very bright star in the constellation Canis Minor). The species scientific name lotor roughly translates from Latin to the washer, referring to the raccoon\u2019s unusual behavior of dipping its food in the water.\nTo most people in North America, the word raccoon brings to mind only a single species, the common or northern raccoon, but there are two other species in the genus: the South American raccoon and the Cozumel raccoon. Although similar in appearance, they do exhibit some subtle differences. The Cozumel raccoon (also known as the pygmy raccoon, due to its smaller size) has a black throat band and a golden yellow tail. For the sake of identification, it\u2019s sufficient to know that the common raccoon is the only species endemic to North America.\nThere are more than 20 recognized subspecies of the common raccoon, including specific Florida, Texas, Baja California, and Snake River Valley variants. Many other subspecies are island specific and don\u2019t interbreed with other populations. Each one varies slightly in skull structure, teeth formula, and fur.\nRaccoon Appearance\nThese animals are one of the most recognizable animals in North America. It has a pointed snout, a wide skull, rounded ears, sharp teeth, a big hunched back (as a result of the hind legs being bigger than the front legs), and a bushy tail with four to 10 black rings. The most distinctive characteristics are the black markings around the eyes that resemble a mask (though not every raccoon has this). The purpose of this mask is not entirely known. It might help the raccoons identify each other. Or it might enhance the raccoon\u2019s night vision. Or maybe it evolved simply due to random chance.\nMuch of the animal\u2019s coat consists of dense gray underfur to insulate it from the cold. Almost all raccoons have the same general color, but an all or mostly white albino variant does exist in nature. There is only about a one in 10,000 chance that an albino raccoon will be born and an even smaller chance they will survive long in the wild since the white color makes them stand out to predators. The elusive albino raccoon is so rare that each new report of one draws a lot of attention. In 2019, a Windsor photographer snapped a picture of two albinos together in the same family. This was estimated to be a one in 750,000 chance meeting.\nRaccoons are animals that average between 2 and 3 feet long from tail to the skull and weigh between 14 and 23 pounds, about the size of a small dog. The male boar is slightly larger than the female sow by about 10 to 30%. But regardless of sex, their body weight fluctuates widely throughout the year. They grow fatter in the winter and slimmer in the summer.\nGeoffrey Kuchera/Shutterstock.com\nRaccoon Behavior\nAided by its excellent night vision and keen eyes, the raccoon is a nocturnal predator that comes out at night to feast. It spends the remaining daytime asleep in its resident rock crevices, hollow trees, and dens, rarely leaving the immediate area unless food is unavailable. Unlike many other mammals, raccoons remain largely active during the winter seasons, when they live off their body fat, sometimes losing up to half their weight before the arrival of spring. Obviously, the northern-most populations must pack on the most pounds to survive the harsh winter.\nOne of the underappreciated aspects of the animal is its surprising agility. On the ground, it can run at speeds up to 15 miles per hour to evade slower predators. They are also excellent swimmers (though lacking in waterproof fur, it spends only a limited amount of time in the water). And with the dexterous hands, they can clamber up trees and then leap to the ground from a distance of 40 feet without being harmed. This appears to provide a means of escape when the raccoon is under significant threat. In 2018, a particularly ambitious raccoon scaled the UBS tower in St. Paul, Minnesota, offering a showcase of the raccoon\u2019s amazing abilities.\nThere is a popular misconception that the raccoon is a solitary animal. But after close observation, it was revealed that they do appear to have a limited social life that revolves around gender-specific groups. When living space becomes tight, multiple animals will share a common area and meet regularly to feed and rest. They aren\u2019t very vocal, except in the relationship between mother and kits, but it does have a set of harsh screams, hisses, growls, and snarls to warn away other animals.\nAs mentioned previously, the raccoon is an animal with an excellent sense of touch. Its dexterous paws are able to manipulate objects and open up shells or seeds. Raccoons also perform well in intelligence and memory tests; it has the same ability to solve complex problems as many other intelligent species.\nThe \u201cwashing\u201d behavior for which the animal is named actually isn\u2019t washing at all. Instead, they appear to be dipping their hands into the water as a way to search for food. Once they have found something, the raccoons will rub their food with their highly sensitive paws and remove any unwanted bits. Since they feed so frequently near banks and shorelines, it can contribute to the mistaken impression that the raccoon is washing its food in the water.\nRaccoon Habitat\nThe raccoon is endemic to a large temperate and tropical habitat stretching between southern Canada and the northern part of South America, though it was later introduced into new habitats like Japan and Europe. These extremely adaptable creatures can thrive in woodlands, grasslands, suburban, and even urban areas; almost anywhere with enough water and some trees or other large structures for protection.\nRaccoon Diet and Predators\nThe raccoon\u2019s diet can best be described as opportunistic, varying from one location to another based on food availability.\nWhat does the raccoon eat?\nThe raccoon prefers a plant-based diet consisting of seeds, berries, nuts, and tubers. It will supplement this with fish, insects, eggs, crustaceans, and other small birds and mammals it finds in the water, snatches from nests, or uncovers in small holes and crevices. The raccoon can be a bit of a pest since it will also raid gardens, trash cans, pet food, and any other morsels left around unprotected. The raccoon handles the food with its hands and chews with its sharp teeth. For a complete analysis of their diet, give our \u2018What Do Raccoons Eat?\u2019 page a read!\u201d\nWhat eats the raccoon?\nSome of the most common predators include wolves, coyotes, snakes, owls, and hawks. It is also hunted by humans but not in large enough numbers to harm population growth.\nRaccoon Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nRaccoons breed once per year in the February to June season, peaking around March. The male will sometimes expand in the natural territory in search of receptive females to court during her brief conception period. Stronger males usually get first dibs on choosing a mate, but even weaker males often have the opportunity to produce offspring.\nAfter a gestation period of about two months, the female will give birth to a litter of three to seven kits at a time. She bears full responsibility for protecting and feeding her blind and helpless young, while the father plays no role at all in the baby\u2019s development. Dependent on the mother for everything, the kit\u2019s eyes finally open after a few weeks of age. By about 20 weeks, the raccoon baby is ready to begin foraging with its mother and learn the basics of survival. Play also appears to be an integral part of the baby\u2019s learning and development. It takes until the following spring before the raccoons are ready to live independently of their mother.\nThe raccoon has a very short life expectancy of two or three years in the wild, because it often falling prey to predators, diseases, or fast-moving vehicles early in their lives. If they manage to survive adolescence, then the life expectancy increases to five years. When it\u2019s completely free of threats, the raccoon can live to 20 years in captivity.\nRaccoon Population\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, the common raccoon is a species of least concern (though the closely-related Cozumel raccoon is critically endangered). The exact population numbers are unknown, but they are likely to be very high. For instance, in wet lowland areas, it is estimated that raccoons have a population density of some 50 per square kilometer (almost three times that per square mile). In forested or agricultural areas, there are some 20 per square kilometer. Over larger territories, there are many millions of them. Given the raccoon\u2019s sheer ubiquity, no specific conservation efforts are required to protect this species, but the numbers are sometimes carefully managed to prevent overpopulation.\nRaccoons in the Zoo\nDespite how common they are in the wild, these animals are still a popular exhibit at the San Diego Zoo, the Seneca Park Zoo, the Minnesota Zoo, the Toronto Zoo, the Tulsa Zoo, the Lehigh Valley Zoo in Pennsylvania, and the Cosley Zoo near Chicago.\nView all 71 animals that start with R"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Falcon images!\nThe falcon is faster than any other animal on earth, both on land and in the air!\nKnown for its precision and speed, the falcon bird seeks out its food like a bird of prey. Falcons, rather than being one species of bird, actually include 40 different species with specific traits that make each one unique. Even with many different types of falcons, the family of birds is wholly considered to be the fastest living animal.\nFalcon birds have a close relationship to hawks, possessing the same ferocity and quick reactions. Their streamlined bodies display slender, pointed wings. With their agility, these birds can often snatch their prey while they are in mid-flight.\nFalcon vs. Hawks\nAs close as falcons may be to hawks, there are many characteristics to distinctly tell them apart. Falcon birds may have broad and long wings, but the hawk has significantly shorter wings, which is the easiest way to tell them apart in the air. Despite their wingspan, hawks tend to be larger than falcons.\nSpeed is another major difference between falcons and hawks. Falcon birds have incredible speed, while hawks can\u2019t match up. They are not nearly as fast, preventing them from gliding through the air in the same way.\nCatching prey is also different between the birds. While falcons go after their prey with their beak, the hawk will catch it with their claws.\nAn Amazing Bird: Falcon Facts!\nThe fastest animal on earth is the peregrine falcon, which reaches speeds of up to 242 mph. It is nearly four times the speed of the fastest land animal (which is the cheetah).\nThese birds can catch their food while they are in mid-flight with their beaks.\nFalcons have incredible eyesight, which is why they are able to capture their food so easily. They can seek both regular color and ultraviolet color, exceeding the range of humans.\nThe cardiovascular system of the bird allows them to beat their wings at a rate of 5 m/s.\nWhere to Find Falcons\nThese birds seem to be spread across the world, including areas from the United States to the Tundra. Each species seems to have its own area that it prefers to reside in. For example, the American kestrel will migrate throughout the contiguous United States, sharing this home with peregrine falcons. They will also travel as far as Alaska and Hawaii.\nPeregrine falcons like to travel even further to every continent, and even feel comfortable in the desert. However, as well-accustomed as they are to extreme temperatures, the only area that this bird will not go to is Antarctica.\nIn these locations, the birds will make their nest from tree holes, as well as on cliffs and natural ledges.\nFalcon Scientific Name\nFalcons go by the scientific name Falconiformes. They belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata. Their class is called Aves and the order is called Falconiformes. Their genus is called Falco.\nThe name \u201chawk\u201d has French and English origins, coming from the word \u201cfaucon.\u201d The Latin word for the bird \u2013 falconem \u2013 comes from the word falx, named for the similarity that their physical characteristics \u2013 like their talons, beak, and wings \u2013 to a curved blade.\nFalcon: The Bird\u2019s Size, Appearance, and Behavior\nThese birds can range from 13 to 23 inches, weighing approximately 1.5 to 3.3 pounds. Most of these prey birds ultimately range from a small to medium size, and their head is adorned with a black crown of feathers. This blackness extends to their nap and wedge as well, connecting the colors to loos like a helmet over the bird\u2019s head.\nWith long and pointed wings, these features are typically slate grey, creating a distinct contrast with the head. Along their throat, the feathers are white to nearly cream in color, and the sides of the abdomen feature both brown and black bars.\nThese birds tend to be solitary, primarily coming together during the mating season and no other times of the year. During the rest of the time, these birds will spend the days either resting at the tops of tall trees or hunting down food. The majority of species will hunt in the daytime, taking any opportunity with the sunlight (even at dusk and dawn) to hunt.\nThese birds will migrate seasonally, seeking out a milder region when the weather is increasingly cold during the winter. The migratory species will often go to Central or South America, though some will only journey to the southern United States. Interestingly, some of them do not migrate at all.\nWhen it comes to their home, falcons are incredibly territorial. They will fight and attack to defend their resting place, protecting themselves and their youth from humans, birds, and other animals.\nNeal Cooper/Shutterstock.com\nFalcon Diet\nThese birds are carnivorous, meaning that they primarily consume meat in their diet. The sources of nutrients that they prefer will vary from species to species, but they are not picky; most often, they will just seek out food that is easy to catch without much work.\nFalcons don\u2019t often go after big game. Rodents, small reptiles, and small amphibians are the most common sources of nutrients.\nFalcon Predators and Threats\nLike many living creatures, these birds tend to have their own slew of predators and other threats to their life. Though their predatory characteristics keep them rather high on the food chain, humans and wolves are both dangers to the falcon population.\nLarge owls will seek out the birds that are still young and inexperienced in their defenses. However, more often than not, animals that prey on falcons will consume their eggs and young for a smaller challenge, as they cannot protect themselves without the help of their parents yet.\nThough these birds are considered to be at the \u201cleast concern\u201d on the endangered species list, there are still many laws that protect these birds (along with hawks and eagles) from being hunted as meat.\nWhat Does a Falcon Eat?\nThe food sources that these birds eat is entirely dependent on what they can lift and what they can catch. As speedy as most rodents are, falcons will seek out mice, rats, and even rabbits. If another bird is small enough to be caught in the sharp beak of the falcon, these birds will seek them out as well.\nAdditionally, they consume snakes and frogs, despite the defenses that these animals may have against predators.\nWhat Eats Falcons?\nAs stated above, wolves and large owls have been known to go after falcons as food. However, they are not often the prey in the wild.\nEven though humans are a threat, most sources say that it is not good to eat them. Their bodies do not often have any fat, due to their physical activity, making the meat rather dry. Furthermore, the primary concern with consuming falcon meat is due to the legal issues around hunting the birds.\nFalcon: The Bird\u2019s Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nMost of the falcon species are monogamous which means that they have one mating partner. They usually mark territories around their nesting sites at the time of mating.\nFemale falcons take full responsibility for the incubation of babies that are known as chicks. They take care of the babies while the male falcons hunt for food.\nEach cluster contains about two to four eggs. The incubation of falcon babies lasts about a month. However, different species of falcon babies take different amounts of time to start flying.\nOn average, falcons live for about 13 years. At most, they live for about 16 to 20 years.\nFalcon: The Bird\u2019s Population\nThe total number of falcons around the world is currently unknown, but their conservations status is considered to be \u201cleast concern\u201d overall. The most recent estimates suggest that there are about 140,000 falcons in the world.\nThe peregrine falcon, however, was formerly considered endangered when certain pesticides were used over 50 years ago, killing much of the population. Since DDT \u2013 one of the deadliest pesticides \u2013 was banned, peregrine falcons have flourished, and their nesting areas are now protected.\nView all 62 animals that start with F"}

It was able to reach 79 to 98 inches in length and 150 to 661 pounds of weight.\nDespite its name, saber-toothed tiger was not a true tiger. This prehistoric animal is only distantly related to modern lions, cheetahs and tigers.\nSaber-toothed tiger was covered with thick coat that had been probably yellowish-beige colored, like in lions.\nSaber-toothed tiger had thick neck, broad chest, muscular body, short, thick legs and short tail, but it is best known by its large, 7 to 12 inches long, curved canine teeth.\nResearchers have recently discovered that teeth of saber-toothed tiger had at least 2 times faster growth rate compared with canine teeth of modern species of wild cats (saber-toothed tiger was able to replace its milk teeth and develop fully grown canine teeth until the age of 3 years).\nSaber-toothed tiger had very thick front legs that were used to immobilize the prey and to prevent it to fight back and potentially break its precious, but brittle canine teeth. Saber-toothed tiger used canine teeth to kill its prey by slicing the jugular vein and windpipe.\nDeer, horses, camels, bison and young mammoths were favorite type of food of saber-toothed tigers.\nSkulls of prehistoric people with wounds that match elongated canine teeth suggest that saber-toothed tigers occasionally hunted primitive humans.\nSaber-toothed tiger was an ambush predator that waited its victims hidden in the trees.\nDespite its huge canine tooth, saber-toothed tiger had weak bite force, only 1/3 of the bite force of modern lion. However, its jaws were able to stretch to 120 degrees, two time more than jaws of lion.\nSaber-toothed tigers were probably social animals. They were able to roar loudly thanks to the hyoid bone in the mouth.\nSaber-toothed tiger didn't have natural enemies, but it had to compete for food with American lion, dire wolf, lynx and puma.\nSpring was the most probable period of year reserved for the mating of saber-toothed tigers. Researchers suggest that pregnancy probably lasted around 8 months. Like in modern wild cats, cubs were probably blind and helpless at birth.\nExact lifespan of saber-toothed tiger is unknown. Scientists believe that is was able to survive 20 to 40 years."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Kookaburra images!\n\u201cThe kookaburra is the world\u2019s largest kingfisher!\u201d\nThe kookaburra, often called the laughing kookaburra, is a large subgroup of the kingfisher bird. It is diurnal, meaning it is most active in the daytime. They will sleep for about 12 hours at night. They are commonly found in eucalyptus trees, which also may be recognized as old gum trees. Australian folklore says that the morning melody of the kookaburra is a cue for the \u201csky people\u201d to \u201clight the sun each morning\u201d. Kookaburras are social birds, living in flocks.\n4 Amazing Kookaburra Facts\nThe kookaburra\u2019s call sounds like laughter.\nKookaburras are part of the forest kingfishers subfamily.\nUnlike other kingfisher species, the kookaburra does not hunt fish.\nKookaburras are known to steal food from snakes.\nWhere to find Kookaburra\nThe kookaburra is native to Eastern Australia, though it has been introduced to other areas as well. Kookaburras live predominantly in the Oceana region. You can find these kingfishers in Southern Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and Tasmania too. Kookaburras also like to dwell in parks, gardens, and sometimes in people\u2019s backyards.\nThe best place to find these fascinating birds is in woodland forest areas and wetlands. They reside in temperate climates. You may see them up in trees or catching prey. Hearing them will likely be an easier task than spotting them. Listen for their laugh-like call around dusk and dawn and you will hear an entire group of kookaburras \u201csinging\u201d loudly together.\nKookaburra Nests\nBoth male and female kookaburra mates work together to prepare nests and also to care for their young. The terrestrial tree kingfishers often utilize naturally occurring holes in trees and will also burrow into arboreal termite mounds. These mounds are typically about two feet deep and have an entrance around four inches wide.\nKookaburra Scientific Name\nThe kookaburra\u2019s scientific name is Dacelo novaeguineae. It is alternatively called a laughing kookaburra or the bushman\u2019s alarm clock. The nickname of bushman\u2019s alarm clock comes from the fact that this bird lets out its call early in the morning, similar to an alarm. It is also sometimes referred to as a terrestrial tree kingfisher. It belongs to the Aves class and the Alcedinidae family.\nThere are three other kookaburra species: the blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii), rufous-bellied kookaburra (Dacelo gaudichaud), and spangled kookaburra (Dacelo tyro). The word kookaburra comes from the Aboriginal Wiradjuri gugubarra, an imitative word resembling the sound of the kookaburra, and meaning laughter.\nKookaburra Size, Appearance, and Behavior\nKookaburras generally have brown, white, and cream-colored bodies. They have dark brown bands across their eyes. Their feathers can also have gray and black coloring. There are also blue specks present near the tail of males. Kookaburras usually have brown eyes. Their mighty beak measures between 8 and 10 centimeters in length. These birds have a size range of 15.4 to 16.5 inches in height and 15 to 17 inches in length. They typically weigh between 13 and 16 ounces with females being slightly bigger in mass.\nThe kookaburra\u2019s wingspan is over two feet long, ranging between 25 and 26 inches. There are some neat facts about their defensive features. Their colors help to camouflage them in their natural habitat, and they will frequently puff their feathers to make themselves look bigger when threatened.\nUnlike many other bird species, kookaburras are not migratory. They occupy the same territory year-round. They do not fly south for the winter. Instead, they huddle together for warmth. They are able to regulate their temperature quite well.\nKookaburras are terrestrial tree kingfishers of the genus Dacelo native to Australia and New Guinea. Paulpixs/Shutterstock.com\nKookaburra Diet\nThe kookaburra is a carnivore, meaning it eats only meat from other animals. It perches in a tree and will watch for prey to come near. When it spots its prey, the kookaburra swoops down and seizes it in its strong beak. One of the more grisly facts about this species is the way it kills its meal. It repeatedly beats the prey against a hard surface such as a tree branch, battering and rendering it lifeless, and making it more tender before eating it. If the prey is small enough, the kookaburra will skip the beating and swallow it whole.\nWhat does kookaburra eat?\nKookaburras eat many animals including snakes, large insects, crustaceans, rodents, frogs, and small birds. Bird eggs are also part of a kookaburra\u2019s diet. When in captivity, such as in zoos, kookaburras are also commonly fed mice, mealworms, and crickets.\nKookaburra Predators and Threats\nThe main threat kookaburras face in the wild is habitat loss. Wildfires in Australia are huge contributors to the destruction of their homes. Humans poaching these incredible animals for the pet trade is also a danger to the wild population. Sadly, kookaburras are sometimes poisoned indirectly from pesticides that kill rodents and other invasive species, which are easy meals for these birds. The IUCN has classified these birds as least concern on the red list with a stable population. Kookaburras also have an array of natural predators.\nWhat eats kookaburra\nBirds of prey such as eagles, owls, falcons, and hawks eat kookaburras. Large reptiles like pythons and monitor lizards will feed on them as well. Other predators include quolls, foxes, and even pet cats. These animals, in particular, may take advantage of chicks who are vulnerable, snatching them from their nest.\nKookaburra Reproduction, Young, and Molting\nKookaburras are a monogamous species that stay together for life. The mating season takes place between August and January. Both the male and female will call out to each other, and the male will bring food to the female in preparation for mating.\nThe mother kookaburra will lay between two and four eggs. After 25 to 29 days, the eggs hatch, and the chicks are born. At the time of birth, the chicks do not have any feathers yet. Sometimes, in competition for food, the chicks will attack and kill the youngest among them. During incubation, and after hatching, siblings will help care for the new young. The chicks are fed for about a month before leaving the nest, though they remain with their family for up to four years. They reach sexual maturity around one year old.\nKookaburras molt annually, during late winter and early spring. Kookaburras have an expected lifespan of 15 to 20 years in the wild and over 20 years in captivity.\nKookaburra Population\nThe precise number of kookaburras in the wild is unidentified. Although there is not an explicit count of these birds, the population is considered stable. The kookaburra conservation status is \u201cleast concern\u201d, with no major threat of population decline currently.\nView all 43 animals that start with K"}

Antlers differ from horns in that they are not permanent and are regularly shed and regrown.\nIn Eurasia, it is believed that the reindeer has been domesticated for nearly 7,000 years - longer than the horse!\nIt is the only species of deer to be domesticated, and also the only species of deer in which both the male and the female grow antlers.\nIn North America reindeer are known as caribou, and, in general, since the term \"reindeer\" represents the family or type of deer, one could say all caribou are reindeer, but not all reindeer are caribou.\nThe North American caribou is approximately 3 subspecies of reindeer which are larger and stockier than the European and Asian reindeer. In addition, although in some reindeer species the female does not have antlers, the females of all North American subspecies do have antlers. Finally, the North American caribou has not been domesticated and is generally a wild animal.\nSome of the subtle and various differences between the other subspecies can be attributed to domestication. The various reindeer subspecies in Eurasia vary in appearance from region to region from Greenland, to Siberia to Scandinavia etc.\nLocal customs and breeding habits naturally cause change as well. There are still wild reindeer in the farthest reaches of Siberia, Norway, Greenland and Finland, but the vast majority of Eurasian reindeer are domestic animals.\nDomestication has occurred for so long that these reindeer sometimes have a \"pinto\" type coloring. The European and Asian native peoples have completely domesticated the reindeer, and their lifestyle is dependent on their relationship with the calm and good-natured domestic reindeer.\nIn Europe, Scandinavia and Asia, the reindeer is used not just for food and fur, but also for milk, as a pack animal, as a pet, and of course for pulling sleighs!\nFor the caribou of Alaska and Canada no such domestication has ever occurred. In general, the native people of Alaska and Canada do not herd or maintain caribou, they simply follow wild herds and hunt individual animals as needed for food and fur.\nThere are dozens of herds of wild caribou in the state of Alaska and their population there is estimated to be more than one million strong.\nthe nomadic reindeer\nThe reindeer of North America, known as \"caribou\", have the longest migrations of any land animal, with some herds traveling over 3,000 miles and covering nearly 300,000 square miles.\nSpringtime migration is an enormous event, with multiple small herds coming together in groups of as many as 400,000 animals.\nReindeer are powerful endurance runners. They can sprint at speeds of almost 50 miles per hour, but can travel at 20 miles per hour for extended periods.\nWhen on the move, searching for food, reindeer will cross lakes and rivers en masse and without hesitation, swimming at speeds of 4 to 6 miles per hour, and can leap large gullies and other obstacles with ease.\nWith amazingly large hearts that carry them further, in harsher environments than any other land animal, the reindeer is a true marathon athlete...\nreindeer reproduction\nReindeer live in herds of as few as 10 to as many as 1,000. They have a very typical herd-animal lifestyle with adult males battling each other for territory and the right to mate with females.\nFemales usually give birth to one calf, on rare occasions two. A newborn baby reindeer is on its feet in minutes and can run as fast as an Olympic sprinter after only half an hour.\nBy the end of day one, the baby reindeer can keep up with the herd at full speed. Amazingly, the Golden Eagle is the number one predator of baby reindeer, and can actually carry newborn calves away in their talons.\nThe mother raises the young calf but the whole herd is protective. Reindeer even have an unusual trait that helps them stay together in white-out or blizzard conditions that they experience often in their arctic world - the joints of their knees actually make clicking sounds as they walk so they know they are still with the herd.\nYoung female reindeer will stay with their mothers and sisters within the same herd their entire lives. Young males usually leave to join a bachelor herd.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "lion", "title": "African Wild Dog Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/African-wild-dog-facts.html", "text": "african wild dog Facts\nAfrican Wild Dog Story\nOne of the coolest African wild dog facts is that they are the most efficient hunters of any large predator, and succeed at a rate of over 80%. The African wild dog, also known as the Cape hunting dog, and African painted dog, is a large, intelligent, canine with a complex social life similar to a wolf.\nOn the hot plains and grasslands of Africa, wild dogs live in tight-knit packs of 20 to 40 animals, the members of which remain so for their entire lives, Often confused with hyenas and having a bit of a reputation.\nAfrican wild dogs regularly appear on peoples least-liked animals list. This page however, is unashamedly partial and will attempt to gain favor upon these fabulous fellows whose intense social drives echo back to the first four paws to ever recline beside us in dark caves of centuries past.\nWild dogs are achingly social, playful, and full of mischief and raw energy. They are constantly on the move, rarely staying in one location for more than a day or two, and this need for roaming space has contributed to their critical status in the wild.\nThere are no preserves large enough to comfortably contain a pack of African wild dogs, and when they stray out onto farmlands and roadways, they fall prey to car bumpers and farmers bullets.\nThe African wild dog is the second largest canine in the world, with the northern grey wolf being much heavier, but not neccessarily taller.\nThese dogs make lots of eerie noises and their habits of grinning and bowing to one another to show submission and friendship is perceived as skulking, and kind of creepy to many observers.\nThe most unfortunate habit wild dogs have is their hunting style, or rather their killing style. As opposed to using a choke hold or a kill bite like most predators, African wild dogs will -as a group- grab a piece of their victim and basically tear it apart.\nThis is an absolutely horrific sight, but actually may be a shorter death for the hapless victim. - African Wild Dog Facts\nThe african wild dog power pack\nAfrican Wild dog rally\nThe African wild dogs intensely close pack structure is its greatest strength, making the pack a force to be reckoned with.\nWild dogs are the most efficient hunters in Africa. They are successful 80% of the time in bringing down antelope, pig, and massive prey such as zebra and wildebeast that may easily be 10 times the size of an individual dog.\nAfter the hunt, the meal is freely distributed to pups, the nursing mom, and the sick, old or injured.\nAlthough they make a tremendous amount of noise and may scream and squabble, African wild dogs are rarely aggressive with each other. In fact, it is often a race to submission rather than dominance, with each dog giving the other a wide-lipped grin, bowing their heads low and \"ha- ha\" or \"huffing\" in reverance.\nThe wild dog pack is extremely tight-knit and works as a big, well-oiled machine because of this harmony.\nThey build up each others confidence with group \"rallies\" where they trot about shoulder to shoulder, tails held high, jostling and mouthing each other, definitely similar to wolves, but also to football players before the big game.\nAfrican wild dogs surround hyena\nWith the right numbers on their side, they will take on some of the largest land predators in the world, including hyenas and African lions, surrounding and tormenting their foe with a circle of grimacing determination.\nWild dogs don't generally kill these big adversaries, although there are accounts of them doing so.\nUsually though, the plan is just to gain whatever the larger animal had in its possesion, or drive it from their territory,. - African Wild Dog Facts\nafrican wild dog reproduction\nAfrican wild dog babies\nWithin the pack generally only the dominant male and female, called the Alpha pair, will reproduce.\nAfter a six week pregnancy the Alpha female will find a safe place, often an abandoned aardvark den, where she may deliver up to 20 puppies in a single litter - the most in the canine kingdom!\nMore commonly about 10 puppies are born. The entire pack helps in the rearing of this one litter. In the world of wild dogs it is the submissive animal who can most fervently beg that tends to eat first.\nFood is distributed to the youngest pack members and sometimes the Alpha pair are actually be the last dogs to eat. The pack will settle down for several weeks while the pups are growing, going out to hunt twice a day and bringing food back in thier bellies which they will regurgitate for the mother and pups to eat.\nAt some point, however, in a strange twist, the mother will join in the hunts - being the Alpha female with lots of experience- and several designated \"babysitters, usually males, will stay behind.\nBecause the entire pack contributes to the raising of one large litter of puppies a year, African wild dog puppies catch on quick, and may be seen out hunting with the pack by the time they are 6 months old. - African Wild Dog Facts\nAfrican wild dog pups\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Vampire Squid images!\nThe vampire squid is a small cephalopod and is found in the tropical as well as temperate oceans.\nThey usually exist in the deep seas and use bioluminescent organs and oxygen metabolism to survive parts of the sea that have extremely low levels of oxygen.\nThis sea creature resembles both squid and an octopus. However, it is none of the two. It has eight arms and two tentacles. The vampire squid\u2019s name comes from its dark color and also the skin that connects it\u2019s multiple arms \u2013 forming a cape-like structure.\nVampire squids have two filaments. However, these sea creatures are only able to extend one filament that helps these fishes overcome energy deficiencies in areas where the concentration of oxygen is low.\nIncredible Vampire Squid Facts!\nArms with spines: Each of the vampire squid\u2019s eight arms has spines that are arranged in two rows.\nLargest eyes in the animal kingdom: These sea creatures have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom in comparison to the size of the body.\nMulti-colored eyes: The eyes of the creature look either red or blue \u2013 depending upon the light that they are in that particular moment.\nA unique way to move forward: These creatures move forward by ejecting water from a hidden organ.\nSeldom eaters: Vampire squid only needs to eat a few times every week.\nVampire Squid Classification and Scientific Name\nThe vampire squid belongs to the class cephalopod and goes by the scientific name Vampyroteuthis infernalis. It belongs to the Animalia kingdom and Mollusca phylum. Interestingly, the literal translation of the scientific name is \u201cvampire squid of hell,\u201d creating a rather memorable moniker for this creature.\nObviously, the vampire squid isn\u2019t actually a vampire. In fact, it seems to have come from early ancestors of the octopus, and it is considered to be an extremophile (i.e. lives 3,000 feet below sea level). Despite the name, it isn\u2019t actually a squid, but it does have a distant relation to both squids and octopi.\nThe order and family that the vampire squids belong to are Vampyromorphida and Vampyroteuthid, respectively.\nVampire Squid Species\nCurrently, there are only one species of these creatures. However, scientists believe that there were others too as some fossils of the species belonging to the same family.\nVampire Squid Appearance\nThese creatures have gelatinous bodies and are jet black to pale reddish. The body colors depend on the different locations and also on the kind of lighting that the creature exists in.\nIt resembles both squid and an octopus but is neither. Though the lineage relates them to both, the creature is quite unique with a size that is approximately that of a football. In fact, it is about the same shape as well.\nThey have eight arms that are webbed together by skin and two tentacles that have spine-like features on them \u2013 which is one of the reasons that these sea creatures got their name.\nThese creatures have red eyes that also sometimes look blue in different lighting and they move forward by ejecting water from a hidden organ. They use bioluminescent organs and oxygen metabolism to survive low oxygen parts of the sea.\nVampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis) model at the Natural History Museum in London, England.\nVampire Squid Distribution, Population, and Habitat\nThese creatures are found between 300 to 3000 meters of sea depth. A majority of them are found at depths of 1500 to 2500 meters.\nThese sea creatures are also distributed direction wise. The north-south distribution is usually localized between the fortieth degree north as well as south latitudes. The water in such locations is about two to six degrees.\nThese creatures are found in the tropical and temperate deep waters all around the globe. Their habitats usually comprise of very cold waters.\nThe population of the vampire squids is not yet known. However, NOAA has declared these sea creatures to be \u2018not threatened\u2019 and it has been said that they are not even slightly dangerous for humans.\nVampire Squid Predators and Prey\nLike any other living creature, they are also preyed upon. Meanwhile, they also prey on other living organisms to fulfill their food needs.\nPredators: What Eats Vampire Squid\nSome of the creatures that form the primary predators for these creatures include:\nWhales\nLarge fish\nSea lions\nPrey: What Vampire Squids Eat\nMeanwhile, the vampire squids are detritivores and are the only cephalopods that do not eat live animals. They usually feed on marine snow and detritus that includes fecal pellets and dead planktonic creatures.\nVampire Squid Reproduction and Lifespan\nSources suggest that at the time of reproduction, the male passes packets full of sperm to the female. The females then store these packets in pouches until they need the sperm.\nThe sperm can rest in the pouch or sac for several weeks before they get to fertilize the egg. It is known that one such packet can be observed as a red dot-like structure near the eye of the creature.\nThe gestation period lasts about 13 months \u2013 during which, the female vampire squid doesn\u2019t eat. It is known to often die after giving birth \u2013 the cause of which is known to be exhaustion.\nThe babies usually don\u2019t eat for some time after birth as they are born with internal reserves of energy.\nThese sea creatures reach sexual maturity for reproduction at about two years of age and are known to constantly reproduce throughout their lives until death.\nThe lifespan of a vampire squid is usually very long. While the total lifespan is unknown, the adult life stage of the squids can last up to eight years.\nVampire Squid in Fishing and Cooking\nThere is very little known about whether or not vampire squids can be fished out from the sea by humans and whether or not they can be cooked and incorporated into the human diet.\nHowever, it is known that they aren\u2019t easy to catch because they stay in very deep waters where light can be restricted. Also, they are known to be harmless and are not considered even slightly dangerous for humans.\nView all 13 animals that start with V"}

Native to polar, temperate and tropical waters on the planet, seals are also known to vocalize: a captive male harbor seal named Hoover was taught to vocalize English with a prominent New England accent.\nFast Facts: Seals and Sea Lions Scientific Name: Phocidae spp (seals), and Otariidae spp (fur seals and sea lions)\nPhocidae spp (seals), and Otariidae spp (fur seals and sea lions) Common Name(s): Seals, fur seals, sea lions\nSeals, fur seals, sea lions Basic Animal Group: Mammal\nMammal Size: Range from 4\u201313 feet long\nRange from 4\u201313 feet long Weight: Range between 85\u20134,000 pounds\nRange between 85\u20134,000 pounds Lifespan: 30 years\n30 years Diet: Carnivore\nCarnivore Habitat: Polar, temperate, and tropical seas\nPolar, temperate, and tropical seas Population: Unknown, but in the hundreds of millions\nUnknown, but in the hundreds of millions Conservation Status: Tropical seals and sea lions have suffered the most from human and climatic changes. Two species are threatened; seven are currently classed as endangered.\nDescription\nSeals and sea lions are highly evolved for swimming, including flippers, a streamlined fusiform (tapered at both ends) shape, thick insulation in the form of fur and/or subcutaneous layer of blubber, and increased visual acuity for foraging at extremely low light levels.\nSeals and sea lions are in the order Carnivora and suborder Pinnipedia, along with walruses. Seals and fur seals are related to bears, descended from an otter-like terrestrial ancestor, and they all have a more or less aquatic lifestyle.\nToshi Miyamoto/Getty Images\nSpecies\nSeals are divided into two families: the Phocidae, the earless or \"true\" seals (e.g., harbor or common seals), and the Otariidae, the eared seals (e.g., fur seals and sea lions).\nThe pinnipeds include 34 species and 48 subspecies. The largest species is the southern elephant seal, which can grow up to about 13 feet in length and more than 2 tons in weight. The smallest species is the Galapagos fur seal, which grows to up to about 4 feet long and weighs about 85 pounds.\nThe species have evolved to their environment, and the handful of those species which are listed as threatened or endangered are those who live in the tropics where human interference is possible. The arctic and subarctic species are mostly doing well. Two species, the Japanese sea lion (Zalophus japonicus) and Caribbean monk seal (Noemonachus tropicalis) have become extinct in recent times.\nHabitat\nSeals are found from polar to tropical waters. The greatest diversity and abundance among seals and sea lions are found at temperate and polar latitudes. Only three phocid species\u2014all of the monk seals\u2014are tropical and they are all either highly endangered or, in two cases, extinct. The fur seals are also found in the tropics, but their absolute abundance is low.\nThe most abundant pinniped is the crabeater seal, which lives in the Antarctic pack ice; the ringed seal in the Arctic is also quite abundant, with numbers in the millions. In the U.S., the most well-known (and watched) concentrations of seals are in California and New England.\nDiet\nThe diet of seals is varied depending on the species, but most eat primarily fish and squid. Seals find prey by detecting prey vibrations using their whiskers (vibrissae).\nSeals and sea lions are mostly fish-eaters, although most of the species also eat squid, mollusks, crustaceans, marine worms, sea birds, and other seals. The ones that eat mostly fish specialize in oil-bearing species like eels, herrings, and anchovies because they swim in shoals and are easy to catch, and are good energy sources.\nCrabeater seals feed almost entirely on Antarctic krill, while sea lions eat sea birds and Antarctic fur seals are fond of penguins.\nImage Source/Getty Images\nBehavior\nSeals can dive deeply and for extended periods (up to 2 hours for some species) because they have a higher concentration of hemoglobin in their blood and their large amounts of myoglobin in their muscles (both hemoglobin and myoglobin are oxygen-carrying compounds). When diving or swimming, they store oxygen in their blood and muscles and dive for longer periods than humans can. Like cetaceans, they conserve oxygen when diving by restricting blood flow to only vital organs and slowing their heart rates by about 50 percent to 80 percent.\nIn particular, elephant seals exhibit tremendous stamina while diving for their food. Each elephant seal dive averages about 30 minutes in length, with only a couple of minutes between dives, and they have been seen maintaining that schedule for months on end. Elephant seals can dive up to 4,900 feet deep and stay down as long as two hours. One study of northern elephant seals showed that their heart rates dropped from a resting rate at the water's surface of 112 beats per minute, to 20\u201350 beats per minute when diving.\nPinnipeds produce a variety of sounds, both in air and water. Many of the sounds are apparently individual recognition or reproductive displays, but some have been taught to learn human phrases. The most famous is a captive male harbor seal at the New England Aquarium named \"Hoover\" (1971\u20131985). Hoover was trained to produce a variety of phrases in English, such as \"Hey! Hey! Come over here!\" with a noticeable New England accent. Although little is known about sound production and acoustic communications as of yet, seals, sea lions, and walruses do have some voluntary control over their sound emissions, perhaps related to their ability to adapt to diving.\nIn polar environments, seals restrict blood flow to their skin surface to keep from releasing internal body heat to the ice and freezing water. In warm environments, the reverse is true. Blood is sent toward the extremities, allowing heat to release into the environment and letting the seal cool its internal temperature.\nReproduction and Offspring\nBecause of their highly developed insulating fur\u2014polar seals and sea lions must regulate their body temperatures between 96.8\u2013100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (36\u201338 Celsius) in frigid waters\u2014they must give birth on land or ice and remain there until the pups have built up enough insulation to withstand the cold temperatures.\nIn many cases, mother seals must be separated from their foraging grounds to take care of their offspring: if they can locate on ice, they can still feed and not abandon the pups, but on land, in groups called rookeries, they must limit their lactation periods so they can go without eating for a period of four or five days. Once the pups have been born, there is a postpartum estrus period, and most females are mated within a few days of the last birth. Mating takes place at the rookeries, and the males exercise extreme polygyny in these dense aggregations, with one male fertilizing many females.\nIn most seals and sea lions, gestation lasts just under a year. It takes between three and six years for pups to reach sexual maturity; females produce only one pup a year, and only about 75 percent survive. Female seals and sea lions live between 20 and 40 years.\nJohn Borthwick/Getty Images\nThreats\nNatural predators of seals include sharks, orcas (killer whale), and polar bears. Seals have long been commercially hunted for their pelts, meat, and blubber. The Caribbean monk seal was hunted to extinction, with the last record reported in 1952. Human threats to seals include pollution (e.g., oil spills, industrial pollutants, and competition for prey with humans).\nConservation Status\nToday, all pinnipeds are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) in the U.S. and there are several species protected under the Endangered Species Act (e.g., Steller sea lion, Hawaiian monk seal.) Threatened species include the Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus townsendi) and the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus, near threatened). Endangered species include the Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki), Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri) Galapagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis); Caspian Seal (Pusa caspica), Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), and Hawaiian monk seal (M. schauinslandi).\nSources"}
{"animal": "lion", "title": "Cougar (Mountain Lion) Habitat - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/cougar-mountain-lion-habitat", "text": "The cougars or mountain lions are animals that are found in a wide range of diverse habitats spanning across 28 countries in the western hemisphere.\nThe cougars or mountain lions (Puma concolor) are mammals that belong to the Felidae (cat) family. They are the most widely distributed amongst all the wild cats in the western hemisphere. They have a very wide range extending from Yukon in Canada to the southern Andes of South America. Hence, across different geographic regions, cougars are called by various names like a puma, deer cat, mountain lion, mountain devil, red tiger, king cat, sneak cat, catamount, Mexican lion, panther, mountain screamer, and silver lion.\nThese animals are more related to small cats than the big ones. They are the largest among small cats and are not classified as big cats, in spite of their large size. Unlike the big cats, cougars cannot roar but can growl and chirp like small cats. They have muscular limbs, large feet, are often plain-coloured (gray or tan), and have a pink nose.\nIn the English language alone, there are over 40 names for cougars, which earns it the distinction of having the most names for a single animal. The cougar is the fourth heaviest cat in the world, after the tiger, lion, and jaguar. In America, it is the second heaviest wildcat, after the jaguar.\nCougar Distribution\nAs mentioned earlier, cougars have a very wide range covering parts of Canada, United States and most of the South American countries. These animals used to be found in almost all parts of the United States, but due to human encroachment, they have suffered a major habitat loss; this has caused the population of cougars to reduce drastically. They have quite literally been eliminated from most regions of the country. Though the cougar is listed as a \u2018least concern\u2019 species, its sub-species \u2013 the Florida panther is classified as \u2018critically endangered\u2019.\nWhere Do Cougars Live?\nCougars adapt to a wide range of habitats at sea level to the ones at an elevation of around 10,000 to 15,000 feet. They thrive in habitats across the cold woods of Canada, the rainforests of Brazil, the western country of the United States and the vast grassy plains (pampas) of Argentina. Cougars can survive in tropical forests, swamps, grasslands, mountain conifer forests, desert scrub, and any location with adequate cover and prey.\nCougars prefer dense forests, coastal swamps, rocky cliffs, and mountain ranges as their habitat, and tend to avoid areas that are open, lack adequate vegetation and stalk cover. It has been observed that the diverse habitats of cougars have something or the other in common. Though they may look entirely different, there are certain underlying factors that make a particular region favorable for cougars or mountain lions. They include, abundance of prey, prey vulnerability, stalk cover, etc.\nAdequate Cover:\nOne of the elements that is common for different cougar habitats is sufficient cover for the animal to hide. Such a cover is vital for hunting and for protecting the young ones. As far as hunting is concerned, the cougar tries to stay out of sight, till it reaches a short distance from the prey. Once the prey is near, the cougar pounces on it and kills it. So, till it reaches the prey, the cougar needs some sort of cover. So most of the cougar habitats offer such cover in the form of thick vegetation, rocks and boulders, etc. A good cover also means protection for its young ones from predators.\nAbundance of Prey:\nIt is natural for any animal to stay in places where they get enough food. In case of cougars, deer are the most preferred prey. So cougar habitats often coincide with the habitat of deer, and animals like, rabbits, moose, sheep, porcupine, capybara, mice, squirrels, etc. Both deer and cougars like dense vegetation. While for cougars, such vegetation offers stalk cover, for deer, it is an escape cover. Deer too need some cover to escape from predators. While deer look for a specific type of vegetation as forage, for cougars, it is the density (and not the type) of the vegetation that matters. These wild cats require somewhat dense vegetation that keeps them out of sight of the prey, at the same time, allows them to see the movements of the prey.\nTerritory\nCougars are solitary animals with individual territories. Only mothers roam about with their cubs. They have large territories, which are usually oval or circular in shape. While males have very large territories, the home range of females are smaller and may overlap with the territories of more than one male. The area of cougar territories depends on the abundance of prey and vegetation. If there is a scarcity of prey in a particular area, the size of individual territories would be large.\nCougar Home\nCougars don\u2019t have permanent dens, but they are often found resting in caves, among rocky outcrops, and in dense vegetation. Cougars have a tendency to migrate to the mountains in winter, mainly for hunting.\nLife Span\nCougars have a lifespan of 8 to 13 years in the wild and up to 20 years in captivity.\nSub-species\nAccording to recent studies, there are around six sub-species of cougars. The sub-species are as follows Florida panther, North American cougar, Eastern cougar, Argentine cougar, Northern South American cougar, Costa Rican cougar.\nTo conclude, cougars are animals that were once commonly seen in almost all parts of both South and North America. Though the extent of their habitat has been reduced, cougars have escaped the threat of extinction, mainly due to their highly adaptable nature. However, conservation efforts are still underway, so that their numbers do not go down further."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Panther images!\nClassification and Evolution\nThe Panther (also commonly known as the Black Panther) is a large member of the Big Cat family, native to Asia, Africa and the Americas. The Panther is not a distinct species itself but is the general name used to refer to any black coloured feline of the Big Cat family, most notably Leopards and Jaguars. The Panther is an elusive and powerful animal that has adapted well to a variety of habitats around the world, and is known to be one of the strongest climbers of all felines. Although the Panther is not technically classified as a separate species, they are considered to be endangered by many due to the declining numbers of both Leopards and Jaguars throughout much of their natural ranges.\nAnatomy and Appearance\nThe Panther tends to be dark brown to black in color and is otherwise identical to the feline species to which it belongs. The only real exception to this is the Florida Panther found in the south east region of the USA, that is believed to be a subspecies of Cougar and is quite rarely dark brown in color and tends to have more of a speckled appearance. Like Leopards and Jaguars, Panthers also have spots. Though they are so dark they can be difficult (if not impossible) to see against the shiny coat of dark fur. Panthers are animals with small heads, strong jaws, and emerald green eyes and tend to have hind legs that are both larger and slightly longer than those at the front. Being a member of the Big Cat family, the Panther is not only one of the largest felines in the world but it is also able to roar which is something that felines outside of this group are not able to do.\nDistribution and Habitat\nPanthers are animals that are natively found on three of the world\u2019s continents, with their location depending on whether or not it is a black Leopard or a Black Jaguar. There are 30 different subspecies of Leopard found across both Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and with the once large natural range of the Jaguar stretching throughout Central and South America and even into parts of the USA, the Panther has become an incredibly adaptable animal that is found in a variety of different habitats. Although they are most commonly found in tropical and deciduous forests, the Panther can also be found inhabiting both marsh and swampland, along with grasslands and even more hostile areas such as deserts and mountains. Along with a number of the world\u2019s largest felines, the Panther is becoming rarer in the wild primarily due to habitat loss in the form of deforestation.\nBehavior and Lifestyle\nThe Panther is an incredibly intelligent and agile animal that is very seldom seen by people in the wild as they are generally very quiet and cautious animals. Their dark brown fur camouflages the Panther both into the surrounding forest and makes them almost invisible in the darkness of night. The Panther is a solitary animal that leads a nocturnal lifestyle, spending much of the daylight hours resting safely high in the trees. Like both the Leopard and the Jaguar, Panthers are incredible climbers and they not only rest in the trees but they are also able to keep a watchful eye out for prey without being spotted. The Panther is an incredibly powerful and fearless animal that is feared by many due to the fact that they are also very aggressive. The Panther is very territorial particularly males whose home ranges overlap those of a number of females and they are threatened by another male.\nReproduction and Life Cycles\nAlthough there are only two different species of Big Cat that are considered to be Panthers, Leopards and Jaguars are actually very closely related despite living in separate parts of the world. Black Leopards and Jaguars often occur in the same litter as spotted cubs with the female usually giving birth to between 2 and 4 cubs after a gestation period of around 3 months (it is a simple recessive gene that makes a cub black and one that is carried by both parents). Panther cubs are born blind and do not open their eyes until they are nearly two weeks old. They are incredibly vulnerable to predators, particularly when left by their mother who must hunt for their food. By the time they are a few months old Panther cubs begin to accompany her in search of prey and often won\u2019t leave her until they are nearly 2 years old and have established a territory for themselves.\nDiet and Prey\nThe Panther is a carnivorous animal and one of the most feared and powerful predators throughout its natural environment. Hunting under the cover of night, the Panther\u2019s dark fur makes it almost impossible to spot meaning that it can move through the jungle completely unseen. Although the majority of their hunting is actually done on the ground, they are also known to hunt from trees meaning that they can ambush their prey from above. The exact diet of the Panther is dependent on where in the world it lives although medium to large sized herbivores comprise the bulk of the diet of many large Cats. Animals including Deer, Warthogs, Wild Boar, Tapir and Antelope are all hunted by Panthers, along with smaller species like Birds and Rabbits when larger prey is scarce.\nPredators and Threats\nThe Jaguar is the largest feline in the Americas and so Panthers in the New World are the most dominant predators within their environments. Those found in Africa and Asia however are occasionally preyed upon by other large carnivores such as Lions and Hyenas, but the most common predator and biggest threat to all Panthers is people. Not only have these rare animals been hunted by people throughout much of their natural range but they have also been subjected to drastic habitat loss particularly in the form of deforestation for both growing Human settlements and to make way for agriculture. Population numbers of large Cats are declining all around the world and when they are being pushed into smaller and smaller pockets of their native habitats, Panthers are becoming even rarer than they already were.\nInteresting Facts and Features\nAlthough technically only black Leopards and Jaguars are generally considered to be the only true Panthers by science, the term is also used to describe a number of other dark coated Cats by locals in their native habitats including Cougars, Tigers, Pumas, Lynxes and Bobcats. The Black Panther is seen to be one of the most intelligent and ferocious predators in America so the image of a Panther is widely used as a logo or as a mascot for sports teams. Some Panthers are actually able to swim, although not those that are Leopards, as Jaguars are known to have a real love of water. Not only do these individuals prefer flooded forests but they spend a remarkable amount of time swimming, playing and hunting in the cooling water.\nRelationship with Humans\nThe world\u2019s Big Cats have been hunted by people as both trophies and for their fur particularly over the past couple of centuries. This caused enormous declines in population numbers of both Leopards and Jaguars with them having actually completely disappeared from some areas of their historic range. Panthers have also been subjected to severe habitat degradation throughout much of Asia, Africa and America which means that these elusive predators are now even rarer. They are very rarely seen by people who are only really ever aware of a Panther\u2019s presence by their tracks left on the ground and scratch marks on trees. They are in fact so sneaky that Panthers are often referred to as \u2018the ghost of the forest\u2019.\nConservation Status and Life Today\nAlthough the Panther is not considered to be a species itself by science, both Leopards and Jaguars are becoming increasingly vulnerable throughout much of their natural range and are listed as Threatened species by the IUCN. However, due to the fact that two gene carrying individuals must mate to produce a Black Panther and the chances of this are decreasing with habitat loss, many wildlife experts consider these animals to be endangered all around the world.\nView all 112 animals that start with P"}

Young females may be cast out by their own mother at as young as 10 months, if she becomes pregnant, or the Alpha female views her as a threat.\nOccasionally groups of brothers or sisters will leave together and attempt to form their own mob, or join another.\nSome individuals, however, remain subordinate their entire lives, never attempting to breed, and simply serving the needs of the Alpha pair and their new litters.\nOnce the babies leave the burrow, the entire mob helps with their upbringing.\nBut each baby meerkat will be assigned a personal mentor, who teaches them important life-skills, like where to dig for grubs, and how to disarm a scorpion.\nThis teaching is precise and systematic, with the mentor first simply providing prey to the youngster, then presenting the youngster with disabled prey, encouraging them to complete the kill, then just observing and giving pointers as the student begins to master the art of the hunt.\nBabies are fully weaned at about 6 weeks, are foraging on their own at 3 months, and begin to take on jobs like babysitting and sentry duty at about a year.\nThe mentor relationship does not continue, and the newly grown meerkat may soon be taking on a student of their own.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Elephant images!\nThe elephant is the largest land animal in the world.\nThese massive giants exhibit all kinds of complex behavior that in some ways mirror our own behavior but in other ways are distinct and unique to them. This has made them the subject of rigorous behavioral, anatomical, and cognitive studies, as well as a source of continued fascination in human culture, particularly in Indian, Sumatran, and some African mythologies and tales. But after decades of decline from poaching and habitat loss, the elephant is in a perilous state, and unless more is done to protect them, they may be on a path toward extinction.\n5 Incredible Elephant Facts!\nThe elephant is one of the smartest animals on the planet. It is one of the few species that exhibit actual self-awareness and self-recognition. It appears to use tools, for example, as a fly swatter. And it has an excellent ability to learn and remember details. Scientists still debate whether elephants mourn their dead, but these creatures do appear to have some interior emotional life.\nThe elephant makes a low, rumbling sound that can be heard up to 5 miles away.\nThe word pachyderm, which derives from the Greek term pachydermos, meaning \u201cthick skinned,\u201d refers to any mammal with a particularly tough hide, including the rhino, elephant, and hippo. None of these animals are closely related to each other, though.\nAn elephant can carry up to 7 tons, making it one of the world\u2019s strongest animals. Learn about the strongest animals in the world here.\nAt one point, scientists believe there were 26 million elephants in Africa alone. Today the world population of elephants is estimated at less than half a million.\nMake sure to give our \u201810 Incredible Elephant Facts\u2018 page a read if you\u2019re looking for more facts on these amazing animals!\nElephant Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for the family of elephants is Elephantidae. There are two living genera in this family. The genus of Loxodonta contains two species: the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant. The genus of Elephas contains only a single living species: the Asian elephant, which itself can be divided further into several distinct subspecies, including the Indian, Sumatran, Borneo, and Sri Lankan elephants. The fossil record contains many more species, including the woolly mammoth, which once walked the planet in the last ice age.\nElephant Appearance\nElephants resemble no other animal on the planet. They are distinguished by the huge bodies, stout legs, thin tails, rounded ears, strong trunks, and in some elephants, the ivory tusks. These long tusks, which grow throughout the elephant\u2019s life, are really just incisor teeth; they allow the elephant to dig for food and water, defend itself, and lift heavy objects with ease. Four molars, each one about the size of a brick, also line the mouth. Another important aspect of the elephant\u2019s anatomy is the thick, wrinkled skin, which can retain about 10 times the amount of water as smooth skin.\nTheir eats are also a unique adaptation and give elephants some of the best hearing among all animals on Earth. On average, elephants can hear the calls from another elephant as far as 2.5 miles away!\nThe elephant is defined most of all by its size. These impressive creatures stand about 10 feet tall, reach about 18 to 24 feet long, and weigh between 4 and 8 tons. The largest specimen ever recorded stood 13 feet tall and weighed a massive 12 tons. Much of the skeletal structure is taken up by the huge skull, which supports the large ears, tusks, and trunk. The skull contains big cavities that reduce the weight without diminishing the strength. Apart from several other physical differences, Asian elephants differ from African elephants in their smaller size and the reduced chance of growing tusks. The Borneo elephant is the smallest subspecies of all; it\u2019s sometimes called the pygmy elephant for this exact reason. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan elephants appear to be the least likely of all species/subspecies to grow tusks from their skull.\nVolodymyr Burdiak/Shutterstock.com\nElephant Trunk\nThe elephant trunk, which actually derives from a fusion of the nose and upper lip, is an impressive instrument that has many useful functions related to touch, smell, and communication. The trunk contains finger-like projections on the tip (the Asian elephant has one and the African elephant two), which enable it to grasp objects as small as a piece of straw. The trunk contains around 150,000 separate muscle fibers with no bones or cartilage and very little fat. This enables it to perform very fine movements that somewhat belies the elephant\u2019s rather hulking appearance.\nElephant Ears\nThe large, rounded ears appear to be a very effective organ for keeping the elephant cool. The size of the ears is a function of the number of blood vessels they contain. This allows an enormous amount of warm blood to flow through the capillaries and release excess body heat into the environment. This effect can be amplified when the elephant flaps its ears.\nElephant Behavior\nThe social life of many elephants revolves around herds and small groups. An elephant herd consists mostly of closely related female cows and their calves, which are led by a single matriarch who helps the entire group find food and water, avoid predators, and locate a shelter. The oldest daughter is almost always poised to inherit the matriarchal position upon the mother\u2019s death. A typical herd consists of around 10 individuals. If the herd grows too large, then some elephants may split off and form a new semi-independent group. The male bulls, on the other hand, either wander alone or form bachelor groups with specific dominance hierarchies. The males are much more likely to gather together during times of scarcity or in the presence of threats. They only come into contact with females when they want to mate.\nElephants have all manner of ways to communicate with each other. The trunk seems to play a critical part in this. A raised trunk seems to indicate a greeting. A lower-ranked member of the herd will also place its tip into the mouth of a higher-ranked individual, perhaps as a conciliatory gesture. Despite the iconic trumpeting sound, many of the noises produced by the elephant to communicate over long distances are actually too low for the human ear to detect. They also produce a growling noise from the stomach that seems to signify to others they are okay.\nDepending on the availability of food, the elephant may spend up to 18 hours a day feeding. The rest of the time is occupied by sleeping, bathing, cleaning itself, and bonding with the rest of the group. Playing and fighting are integral parts of their behavior. They tend to spar playfully with other elephants close to their own age.\nIn the wild elephants only sleep about two hours per day and prefer to sleep while standing up. In captivity, elephants will sleep closer to six hours per night and with no predators to worry about will sleep lying down.\nElephant Habitat\nThe elephant inhabits the savannas, deserts, marshes, and forests near rivers of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The Indian, Sumatran, Borneo, and Sri Lankan elephants all generally correspond to those particular geographical regions. But this range is actually reduced from its greatest historical extent. The Asian elephant, for example, once had a much larger range stretching between Syria and China. The African forest elephant is now reduced to a small piece of land in the Congo basin of western Africa.\nElephant Diet\nThe elephant is an herbivorous mammal whose only source of nutrients is vegetation. It needs an enormous amount of food to sustain itself. A typical individual consumes up to 330 pounds of food in a single day, although up to half of this may pass through the body without being properly digested.\nWhat does the elephant eat?\nElephants will eat almost any type of vegetation, including grasses, leaves, fruits, twigs, roots, and bark. The exact composition of its diet tends to vary based on location and season. Herbivores generally have two different strategies for obtaining food: browsing, in which they selectively feed on shrubs and trees above the ground, and grazing, in which they lightly feed on vegetation along the ground. Many elephants are both browsers in the dry season and grazers in the wet season. African forest elephants are primarily browsers but also mix in a lot of fruits.\n(And no, in case you were wondering, elephants do not eat peanuts!)\nElephant Predators and Threats\nAside from natural predators, the animal is under threat from poaching (due to the value of their tusks), habitat loss, and growing conflict with people. Some of these threats are amplifying each other. As the animal\u2019s natural habitat diminishes from the spread of agriculture and residential housing, it comes into contact with people, which can result in trampled crops and damaged properties. This in turn may cause people to retaliate against them.\nWhat eats the elephant?\nA full-grown adult elephant faces no consistent threats in the wild. Its massive size and thick hide make it almost impervious to attacks. However, a juvenile calf may be vulnerable to hyenas, lions, tigers, leopards, and African wild dogs, so it seeks protection from the group.\nElephant Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nAs they reach sexual maturity, male bulls undergo a periodic transformation called musth in which their testosterone levels surge to 10 times their normal amount. This is characterized by aggressive behavior, enlarged temporal glands behind the eyes, and a continuous dribble of urine as they walk. The musth is intended to advertise the bull\u2019s physical condition and shape, both to the females who may be looking for a mate and to the males who may be looking out for competitors. Males in musth are known to fight with each other, which rarely results in death. Females also release signals about their readiness to mate in various secretions. One male can have multiple female mates in his lifetime.\nAfter mating, the female carries a single calf for about 22 months, longer than any other species of mammal. The baby is able to stand up and walk within an hour of its birth. However, it still requires the protection and care of the entire herd. If an adult senses danger, then it will make a loud trumpeting sound. The herd will then form a protective ring around the calves, facing outward to deter the predator. While the female herd may be doting caretakers, the father plays almost no role in the actual development of the offspring.\nIt takes a long time for a baby to master the nuances of elephant life. In the 13 to 20 years it takes to reach full maturity, these animals need to develop their coordination, learn social nuances, and develop bonds. It\u2019s been suggested that a poorly reared elephant may exhibit some anti-social behavior. Meanwhile, it takes a full five or six years before the baby is fully weaned from its mother\u2019s milk. The calf packs on 2 to 3 pounds every day over the first year alone. Upon growing fully, the females tend to stay with the group, while the males tend to leave and forge their own path in life. They can easily live in excess of 50 years in the wild.\nThe oldest elephant to ever live reached 88 or 89 years old and lived in captivity in India. Indian elephants tend to live longer than their African counterparts.\nElephant Population\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, which publishes a list of threatened species, both the African bush elephant and forest elephant are considered to be vulnerable species. Only about 415,000 remain in the wild. This is a fall of some 90% since the early 20th century. The Asian elephant is in an even worse state. With only about 45,000 remaining and its population heavily fragmented, it is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.\nConservationists are focusing their efforts on habitat protection and the end of poaching. Following an international agreement in 1989 that banned the ivory trade, poaching rates did temporarily subside. This was further bolstered by China\u2019s ban on its domestic ivory market in 2018. Conservation groups are also working with local people to reduce negative interactions and create elephant corridors and safe places for them to roam. However, due to low birth rates and long maturation times, it takes a while for elephant populations to replenish.\nElephants in the Zoo\nDue to their food and space requirements, only a few zoos are privileged enough to harbor these animals. The San Diego Zoo has a unique area called the Elephant Odyssey habitat that contains both African and Asian elephants. These animals are also present at the Indianapolis Zoo, the Maryland Zoo, the Seneca Park Zoo, the North Carolina Zoo, the Los Angeles Zoo, the Cincinnati Zoo, and Zoo Atlanta.\nView all 68 animals that start with E"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Mackenzie Wolf images!\nThe Mackenzie wolf goes by many names, but their inherited genetics from the wolves before them make them one of the top hunters in the entire world.\nTheir gray and white coat keeps them warm and hidden from anything they hunt, while their strong neck and jaw can take even the largest game (like bison and ox) down quickly. The desire to keep this top spot as a hunter is buried within their instinct since only the strongest pair is chosen as the alpha to reproduce.\nIn spite of the wolves \u2018 superior hunting techniques, they may still be attacked by bears and other wolves during their hunts.\n4 Incredible Mackenzie Wolf facts!\nThough there are approximately 40,000 Mackenzie Valley wolves around today, they are quite an interesting breed. Here are a few facts about the apex predator that roams the northwest region of the Americas.\nThe Mackenzie Valley wolf goes by many names, including the Alaskan timber wolf, Canadian timber wolf, Northwestern wolf, and the Rocky Mountain wolf.\nThough this wolf typically is gray or black, their coat can also be white, tan, gray, or blue.\nThe reason that the Mackenzie Valley wolf is so big is due to the big game that they hunt, like elk and bison.\nOnly the alpha pair in a pack reproduce.\nMackenzie Wolf Scientific name\nThe Mackenzie Valley wolf is most commonly called the Northwestern wolf, but they have many other names that they go by as well, like the Alaskan timber wolf, the Canadian timber wolf, and the Rocky Mountain wolf. They are part of the Canidae family in the Mammalia class. Though they do not have any subspecies of their own, their subspecies is the Canis lupus occidentalis, which is also their scientific name.\nWhile \u201cCanis lupis\u201d is simply the scientific name for the wolf species as a whole, they are differentiated with \u201coccidentalis.\u201d This name was given to the species by Sir John Richardson in the early 1800s. The Scottish naturalist noted that, while it would be easy to label the species by their distinct color, \u201coccidentalis\u201d was used to refer to the location that the wolf is found in. The word literally translates to meaning \u201cof the western regions,\u201d referring to their native North American habitat.\nMackenzie Wolf Appearance\nThe appearance of the Mackenzie wolf is rather distinct. After all, the genetics of the wolf is the influence behind many domestic dog species. This particular wolf species has a bristly but thick coat, helping them to survive during the brisk winters of the Northwest region of the United States and Canada.\nWhile their coat is sometimes white, the most common colors are gray and black. They are also found in tan and blue, depending on the region that they need to remain hidden in. Their multicolored appearance helps them to hide amongst forest areas as they hunt in their groups, which are also known as packs.\nThese wolves \u2013 also known as the Canadian timber wolf or the Alaskan timber wolf \u2013 have an incredibly strong and powerful neck to support their head. The head tends to be rather heavy and powerful, filled with sharp teeth that can overpower any of their prey. In fact, the reason that this animal is so large is because of their plentiful prey availability in their habitat.\nMales are larger than females with a weight of up to 159 lbs. in some areas. Females, on the other hand, typically don\u2019t weigh more than 132 lbs.\nMackenzie Valley Wolf, two wolves in the snow.\nMackenzie Wolf Behavior\nMackenzie Valley wolves prefer to live within a pack, which is a group that consists of anywhere from 6 to 12 wolves. Breeding is only done by the largest and strongest pair in the group. They don\u2019t often come in contact with humans, but their body language allows them to communicate with others in their pack.\nThe alpha wolves set the rules, and they are easy to identify by their tall stance. Wolves that are not alphas will exhibit submissive behaviors around these older pack members, lowering their bodies when they are around. They\u2019ll also leave their tails down. This hierarchy is strongly enforced with the use of body language, posture, scent-marking, and vocalizations. While they are often depicted as howling at the moon, this caricature isn\u2019t quite the reality. They will howl when the full moon is out, giving a little light to their stoic figure.\nThese wolves don\u2019t like to stay in one place for very long, though they will come back to their primary habitat. Throughout the day, they will scan about 40 miles of ground hunting, which can take about 8-10 hours daily.\nMackenzie Wolf Habitat\nJust like the common name of the Makenzie Wolf (i.e., the northwestern wolf) suggests, the main home of this animal is the northwest area of North America. They can be found as high as Alaska, though they are also found in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Sometimes, the breed also goes as far south as the northwest region of the United States.\nOnce the Mackenzie wolf establishes the home that they have chosen, they can be territorial of the area. They typically inhabit areas with massive forests or mountain areas. They thrive in the cold, which is what their coat is made to withstand.\nMackenzie Wolf Predators and Threats\nMuch of the habits of wolves focus on hunting at night for their prey. They are carnivorous, seeking out other animals as their source of nutrients. About 10 hours a day are spent looking for the prey that can feed the wolf and their pack. They are apex predators, but they still have a few predators that will come after them (like humans and bears).\nWhat eats and hunts Mackenzie Wolves?\nEven as an apex predator, the Mackenzie wolf is not entirely safe. Apart from being hunted by humans, combat between this mammal and bison or bears can lead to their death. For the most part, the wolves can roam without the threat of other animals unless they directly attack them.\nWhat does the Mackenzie Wolf eat?\nThe physique of the Mackenzie Valley wolf (or the Rocky Mountain wolf) makes them one of the top hunters in the world, which is why they have so many options to prey on. Due to their habitat in forests and mountains, the most common diet includes Dall sheep, mountain goats, lemmings, salmon, snowshoe hare, musk oxen, elk, wood bison, caribou, and even Sitka black-tailed deer. Sometimes, they\u2019ll feed on beavers too.\nThe powerful teeth and strong muscles of the Mackenzie Valley Wolf (a.k.a. the Rocky Mountain wolf) are enough to take any of these animals down.\nMackenzie Wolf Reproduction and Life Cycle\nWhile much of the species thrives on the ability to procreate, the Mackenzie Valley Wolf is a monogamous species. However, their breeding habits are rather unique because the pack only has one breeding pair. The pair is based on the oldest, strongest, and largest wolves in the pack, which may be a matter of genetically selecting the best chance of survival.\nMost often, the mating season will occur in January and February, and the female will remain pregnant with her pups for about 63 days. Once the litter is born, she typically will give birth to 4-6 live young, which are also known as pups or whelps. These pups are protected within a den, protecting the defenseless pups while their hearing and sight develop (which can take up to 2 weeks). While the pups will explore beyond the den as early as 3 weeks old, they will need their mother\u2019s milk until they are about 8 weeks old.\nThe pups will become adults between 6-8 months old. However, their body is not ready to reproduce until they are almost two years old as females. Males take approximately one more year before they are ready to reproduce. The average lifespan of these wolves is typically 6-8 years in the wild. However, animals in captivity may live twice as long for their protection from predators and consistent habitat.\nMackenzie Wolf Population\nThe main threats to the Mackenzie Valley wolf aren\u2019t other predators, though there are a few larger animals that may hunt them. The loss of their habitat is the biggest cause of their depleting numbers. Humans will also hunt and trap these wolves, which is why less than 50,000 exist in Canada today.\nAn official population number is not currently provided by the IUCN Red List, but these wolves are endangered. The population\u2019s attacks on local deer and elk help to naturally control these species, which benefits the overall ecological balance.\nView all 111 animals that start with M"}

They primarily eat grass and small shrubs; however, they are also fed grain or other forms of pelletized food in farming or domestic environments.\nWhy mules are sterile?\nMules are almost always sterile due to the fact that they have 63 chromosomes. There have, however, been instances in which female mules have successfully given birth.\nCan a mule have a mule?\nMules are largely incapable of bearing offspring. However, even if they could, by the nature of what a mule is \u2014 a hybrid of a donkey and a horse \u2014 a mule cannot give birth to a mule.\nAre mules dangerous?\nMules are less dangerous than their parents. The donkey stubbornness and the skittishness of the colt combine to form an extremely even-tempered animal. A key trait of the mule is that in confined spaces they will not thrash about and injure themselves as a horse tends to. While they are very strong, mules are difficult to provoke, and they are born already domesticated and used to human interaction.\nWhat are mules used for?\nMules are used for a variety of purposes. Throughout history, they have most commonly been used for draft and pack animals; however, they have also been used as mounts, and they even compete in all the same types of equestrian events as horses. The smallest mules were used as draft animals within mines.\nWhat is the difference between a mule and a horse?\nThere are a number of differences between a mule and a horse:\nMules are more docile, even-tempered, and more intelligent than stallions. They are slightly smaller but stronger than stallions. A mule also consumes significantly less food than a horse of the same size. Their skin is thicker and better able to withstand temperature extremes and friction as well.\nWhat Kingdom do Mules belong to?\nMules belong to the Kingdom Animalia.\nWhat phylum do Mules belong to?\nMules belong to the phylum Chordata.\nWhat class do Mules belong to?\nMules belong to the class Mammalia.\nWhat family do Mules belong to?\nMules belong to the family Equidae.\nWhat order do Mules belong to?\nMules belong to the order Perissodactyla.\nWhat genus do Mules belong to?\nMules belong to the genus Equus.\nWhat type of covering do Mules have?\nMules are covered in Fur.\nWhat is the main prey for Mules?\nMules eat grass, weeds, and vegetables.\nWhat are some predators of Mules?\nPredators of Mules include foxes, wolves, and lions.\nHow many babies do Mules have?\nThe average number of babies a Mule has is 1.\nWhat is an interesting fact about Mules?\nMules are the offspring of a horse and a donkey!\nWhat is the scientific name for the Mule?\nThe scientific name for the Mule is Equus mulus.\nWhat is the lifespan of a Mule?\nMules can live for 15 to 20 years.\nHow fast is a Mule?\nA Mule can travel at speeds of up to 15 miles per hour.\nWhat is the difference between a mule and a donkey?\nAn important difference between a mule and a donkey is that a donkey can reproduce while a mule can\u2019t.\nWhat is the difference between a mule and a hinny?\nA hinny is born from a male horse and a female donkey, while a mule is born from a female horse and a male donkey."}

That won\u2019t happen with a cat: According to ScienceABC, they have an extra \u201cmirror\u201d layer at the back of their eye behind their retina, which means that the incoming light has two chances to hit the rods. In the human eye, if it misses, the light is absorbed in a black layer behind the retina and is gone forever. Pups have less color-sensing cells in their eyes so their color vision may be only 1/7th as vibrant as ours. According to the American Kennel Club, scientists believe that a dog\u2019s color vision is similar to that of a person who has red\u2013green colorblindness.

{"animal": "lion", "title": "Classifying Animals - Fact Monster", "url": "https://www.factmonster.com/math-science/biology/plants-animals/classifying-animals", "text": "The inventor of modern scientific classification was Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778) a Swedish botanist who classified and described more than 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants.\nThere are billions of different kinds of living things (or organisms) on earth. To help study them, biologists have devised ways of naming and classifying them according to their similarities and differences.\nThe system most scientists use puts each living thing into seven groups (or taxons), organized from most general to most specific. Therefore, each species belongs to a genus, each genus belongs to a family, each family belongs to an order, etc.\nFrom largest to smallest, these groups are:\nKingdom\nPhylum\nClass\nOrder\nFamily\nGenus\nSpecies\nKingdoms are huge groups, encompassing millions of kinds of organisms each. All animals are in one kingdom (called Kingdom Animalia); all plants are in another (Kingdom Plantae). In the most widely-used system, there are five kingdoms, containing animals, plants, fungi, prokaryotes, and protoctists (the last two are different sorts of one-celled organisms). Other systems have six or more kingdoms.\nSpecies are the smallest groups. A species consists of all the animals of the same type, who are able to breed and produce young of the same kind. For example, while any two great white sharks are in the same species, as are any two makos, great whites and makos are in different species (since they can't interbreed).\nA Sample Classification\nThe lion belongs to the following groups:\nKingdom Animalia (includes all animals)\n(includes all animals) Phylum Chordata (includes all vertebrate animals, as well as some other more primitive ones)\n(includes all vertebrate animals, as well as some other more primitive ones) Class Mammalia (includes all mammals)\n(includes all mammals) Order Carnivora (includes carnivorous mammals, from bears to raccoons to harbor seals)\n(includes carnivorous mammals, from bears to raccoons to harbor seals) Family Felidae (includes all cats)\n(includes all cats) Genus Panthera (includes the great roaring cats: lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards)\n(includes the great roaring cats: lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards) Species leo (lions!)\nFor more, see Examples of Scientific Classification"}
